        "content": "Kasey Jenkins: Good morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany in this call, we\u2019ve posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted leverage ratio that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for 2019, the net non-recurring benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides. As a reminder, we completed a 2-for-1 stock split at the end of our fiscal 2020. As a result, all per share amounts mentioned today will be also included in our 10-K, reflects the virtual access presentation of those amounts on a split adjusted basis. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. It is important to note these statements include expectations and assumptions, which will be shared related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors including the impacts of COVID-19 that could affect our financial results. It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4. Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020, despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product, our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment. We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain, and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We\u2019re also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, two fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond. As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantage global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels, the breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers, and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile time as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home, our at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged goods company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other food service customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption in each, as well as the pace of each region\u2019s COVID-19 recovery. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I\u2019m confident our operating momentum will continue. In our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum, and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sale, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation. This morning, I\u2019ll begin with our fourth quarter results reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go and more depth on the quarter end fiscal year results, as well as the details of our 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 6, starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line versus the year-ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4% with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19 related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income for the partial offset for lower interest expense. Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7 in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6%, on constant currency 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing and scanner data. As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter, due to the sustained increase in demand to protect our top selling holiday items. We had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. In consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores, as well as some impact from the lower promotional activity. Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio, and spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate, and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buyer rates. Our fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraint, it had double-digit growth for the year as its spices and seasonings and the other key categories. In the fourth quarter, we continue to gain share and categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinades and Asian products. The majority of our categories continued to outpace the total store, and center-of-store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb\u2019s, Lawry\u2019s, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth as McCormick branded consumptions outpacing all major categories. But we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly-elevated level of our fourth quarter. We do expect continued at long lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home, the most recent IRI scanner sales data for the five weeks ending January 17. So, total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again. In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on a holiday proving to be successful. In our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen or digital engagement with consumers, we\u2019re capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity after trial, an increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we\u2019ve recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and we\u2019ll continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation. Now, turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% of the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continued to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region at several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets and our Vahine brand in France, again, had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. In the UK, Frank\u2019s RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share and spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness and branded food service products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The food service industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace. growth in China was also impacted quite a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank\u2019s RedHot in Australia. Turning to Slide 8, our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to grow in the fourth quarter. For the constant currency sales increase of 3% in all three regions contributed to the sales growth in both our Americas and EMEA region, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products. Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines and our away-from-home customer base for branded food service and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded food service growth of 2%. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China\u2019s growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers. But we continue to see momentum and limited time offers as a core business, partially driven by the customer\u2019s promotional activities. Moving from our fourth quarter results, I\u2019m pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we\u2019ve achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment led by consumers cooking and eating more at home, partially offsetting this growth was at 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment. COVID-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out reduced demand from restaurants and other food service customers. We achieved $113 million of annual cost savings driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings. 2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations, ending the year at over $1 billion, the 10% increase from last year. We\u2019re making great progress with our working capital improvements. At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Now, I\u2019d like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly at 2020, which we were well-prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift increased online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead. We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing of 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter, across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again, recognized as we were ranked as the number one food brand with the highest designation of Genius by Gartner L2 Research and their digital IQ U.S. ranking. This is the seventh year in a row, we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands. We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what\u2019s right for people, communities and the planet. In 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc\u2019s Top 50 companies. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as number one in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year, as well as the number one U.S. company overall and globally, number six overall. Finally, during the year, we continue to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art Northeast Distribution Center in Maryland, which will optimize their distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the UK to support the region strong and growing customer base. In China, we were investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. these investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum. Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I\u2019d like to comment on a recent acquisition announcement and provide highlights related to our growth momentum in 2021 plans. Starting on Slide 11, an addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms. There\u2019s the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors and presets the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration more value added and technically insulated products. We\u2019re excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula\u2019s significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula\u2019s brand presence, increase the availability of its product and expand its product offerings into new flavors, formats, and eating a cadence to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. In our Flavor Solutions segment with our broad presence across all food service channels, we\u2019ll be focusing on strengthening Cholula\u2019s go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand a little as distribution and its existing food service channels, as well as increased new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick\u2019s reach across customers combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends expands to the recipe inspiration and Flavor Solutions that we offer operators. Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth and developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength. We\u2019re providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. With the addition of FONA, we\u2019re advancing our health and wellness portfolio. we\u2019re expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods. We\u2019re putting expertise in favoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA\u2019s predominantly natural portfolio, as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus fruit flavors. Combination of our technology platform and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better for you, and consumer-preferred flavor solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. Our complimentary customer basis of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA\u2019s customer centric culture is very similar to ours and with the combined power of our organizations; we\u2019re well positioned to reach a broader customer base deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver on our acquisition plan. This confidence is bolstered by our proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance acquired businesses such as our acquisition of Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy in both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisition. Now, I\u2019d like to briefly comment on the conditions we\u2019re seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plans starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. we\u2019re capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands, as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio sustainably positions us for a continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions, and a robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments. Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which has real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in food service, which in China is in our Consumer segment. As well as optimism about the Chinese New Year Holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown. And in Australia, either with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption and we\u2019re seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same as in the Americas. Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better tasting and cost less. And while there has been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there\u2019s a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home, will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new product and our strong category management initiatives. Our categories across the globe experienced the sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020, because of this shift in consumer preference, which coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity deplete its finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. Currently, service levels are improving and the restoration plants have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top selling product. We\u2019ve now resumed shipping approximately two thirds of the products, which had been suspended, but the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We\u2019re continuing to work through a stabilization period and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both of our \u2013 both our customers and McCormick. Now, I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us on long-term solutions. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re well positioned for success in 2021 and have implemented the efficient long-term solutions, and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth. Also in the U.S., in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings consumers by introducing new merchandising elements, to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021 and with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth. Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action by targeting messaging focused on providing information and inspiration. For instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and products, keep the meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020. New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last three years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumer. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. Overall, the selling of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers, slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on the retail shelf. Moving into 2021. We\u2019re excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and I\u2019ve seen various stages of recovery from a food at home perspective our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned, last quarter, we\u2019ve returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We\u2019re carrying our growth momentum, packaged food customers into 2021, driven by strength and their core iconic product, as well as new products and bigger bet innovations in 2021. In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other food service customers are still impacted by government imposed COVID-19 restrictions in those markets. Some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as of the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models for delivery carried out. The recovery of our branded food service customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences. Overall, there is significant disruption experience in 2020. Recovery has begun and we\u2019re expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and food service industry. We had positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We were advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement and Flavor Solutions, and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships. Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories, we\u2019ll continue in 2021. With top-line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale or momentum in flavor categories, as well as the opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy. In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment at positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery, and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. All of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020s level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our fundamentals momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum, reinforce our confidence and delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying based business performance and acquisitions, driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization. Our top tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we\u2019re positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time. Now, I\u2019d like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement, as well as adapted to this new environment. Now, Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full-year results as well as detailed on our 2021 outlook. Starting on Slide 19, during the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume index in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year, pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments. The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions. On Slide 20, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French\u2019s, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases with volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings, and recipe mixes as well as private label products due to capacity constraints. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers for our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, our Vahine homemade dessert products and our Kamis branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined to 10% in constant currency, driven by the lower branded food service sales, and a shift to a later Chinese New Year as Lawrence mentioned. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 23, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales, 3% with growth in all three regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover costs increases, also partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded food service and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand from package group companies with particular strength in snacks seasoning. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5% attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increase driven by sales growth with packaged food company with strengthened snack seasonings partially offset by lower sales to branded food service and other restaurant customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers\u2019 limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period, with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth and in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline of branded food service sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. As seen on Slide 28, gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year-ago period as we have planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago, as well as higher distribution and transportation costs. For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix, resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19 related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% at constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense, and COVID-19 related costs. In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19 related costs and higher incentive compensation expense with a partial offset from CCI-led cost savings. Turning to income taxes on Slide 29, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year-ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full year was comparable to 2019. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year-ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year. On Slide 32, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion. A 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. We\u2019ve returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank\u2019s RedHot and French\u2019s brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9 times and we expect to delever to approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt pay down and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan. Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment, and beginning of supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend all the initiatives we have in progress, as well as support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends to paying down debt. Now, I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34 with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million to $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023 with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impacts for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimates. In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will spend approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this some investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantage flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, which with earnings growth, partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment, as well as the projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated two percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. At the top line, we expect to grow the constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020\u2019s level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021, that\u2019s compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021\u2019s COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs, and of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a low level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact that I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs or incremental ERP investment and the tax headwinds. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96 compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments, as well as the low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year, but recognized we are lapping in a very strong second quarter of 2020. In summary, we are projecting a strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs in the ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. As Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35. We delivered strong results in 2020, despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies. We have a strong foundation. We\u2019re confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption, ends with the investments we\u2019ve made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We\u2019re excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiments flavors growth platform. We\u2019re confident these investments further position us for continued success. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflect another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We\u2019re confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times. Now, let\u2019s turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi there, Lawrence. Thank you for the additional color in consumer, Americas around some of the capacity and service level dynamics that you were facing over the last couple of months or quarters. I guess, first off, I\u2019m curious if those dynamics are in such a place now, where we should expect sort of shipments to start to outpace consumption, sort of in 1Q and 2Q, or if you expect still maybe, somewhat of a lag effect, because you\u2019re still building the capacity and the service levels to where you want them to be. because I\u2019m trying to just dimensionalize that sort of first quarter aspect. But more importantly, how to dimensionalize maybe, how big of a benefit to 2001 organic growth, just a rebuilding of inventory levels to the extent that needs to happen can be to organic growth? I\u2019m going to just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. Well, Andrew, we\u2019ve been ramping up production as we\u2019ve gone through the fourth quarter \u2013 certainly, through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls and anybody that walks into the store can see that the shelves are pretty poor condition. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings. The recipe mix is that, reflects the fact that we\u2019ve had our secondary skews on suspension to protect the key holiday items and it\u2019s really been those two categories that had the greatest impact that our other product categories have had a pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that\u2019s been our focus area. We have, starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on, as we said in our prepared remarks about two thirds of them, have been reinstated and remainder coming in the coming weeks. So, I think we\u2019ll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next over the next few weeks. we still are allocating products. There\u2019s a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries, being a bit fair during this time as well. So, we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year and that we\u2019re really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of tumor inventory. I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. Just the scale of our consumer business and the Americas is so great. Particularly, in the fourth quarter of the year, even in normal circumstances, we have to pre-build inventory to supply that a huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year; and coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That\u2019s why we were signaling that we were going to have surface issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. as we\u2019ll say, just commenting on current conditions and I don\u2019t want to get too much into 2021, we\u2019re almost two thirds of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers while we\u2019re always still allocating products. It\u2019s the best service that we\u2019ve had since the spring.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. Thank you for that. And then a super quick follow-up, I found your comments very interesting around the trends you\u2019re seeing in Australia, as restrictions ease, consumption of at-home items still remains elevated at this point. And some other companies have said similar things. I\u2019ve also heard similar things be discussed around China for some companies as well, various restrictions of ease and I may have missed it. Are you seeing that same dynamic in your China business as well?\nMike Smith: Yes, we are, but it\u2019s not quite as clean in China. Because in China, they factually reinstated some restrictions, that\u2019s not the same as it was a year ago, where there was a government lockdown. but the government is encouraging people not to travel, is encouraging people to celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Generally, in China when the government gives encouragement to do something to do it. And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I\u2019m not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior. It\u2019s not quite as clean as in Australia, where COVID seems to be under control, restrictions have been lifted, and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home. In 2021, Chinese New Year is \u2013 later in the first quarter, so it will \u2013 after that have done, we\u2019ll have a better read on it. Yeah, I think so.\nLawrence Kurzius: Andrew, there are a couple of other companies I\u2019ve commented on it and I\u2019ll just say it again. Our consumer research, both the syndicated information that we get in our own proprietary research says consumers are enjoying cooking more at home. Three out of four consumers say it relaxes them and reduces their stress, fully up poorer consumers say they actually tend to cook more at home after the pandemic, then they are even now and with the added uncertainty around the vaccine timing and the take-up of the vaccine and do a variance emerging, I think that there\u2019s a lot of reasonably consumptions going to be elevated this year, at least for quite some time.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks so much.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, Ken.\nKen Goldman: I wanted to ask \u2013 hey everybody. I think you\u2019ve mentioned when you talked about the sales drivers \u2013 organic sales drivers for 2021, I think you mentioned volume and product mix, unless I missed it, I didn\u2019t think I heard pricing. So, I\u2019m curious, do you expect pricing to play any major role in your growth this year and as a corollary to that, how might you maybe, describe the willingness of your customers to kind of accept quite sites at this time?\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. Well, Ken, first of all, pricing is an ongoing discussion with customers. I don\u2019t want to get too specific about pricing actions that haven\u2019t been taken, because of customer and competitive reasons on the end. And so our comments on that are pretty limited right now. I\u2019ll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are the Flavor Solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on a contractual relationship for this, a pass-through of pricing. I don\u2019t think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe, some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. We are seeing cost inflations, freight is up, ocean freight in particular, is an emerging \u2013 current and emerging concern, but really, not prepared to talk about make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions and where we need to take pricing in 2021, we\u2019re confident we can take it.\nKen Goldman: Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, you\u2019re balancing a lot of things right now that some might consider outside, what might be the normal course of business, right? You\u2019re undertaking an ERP implementation, or at least you\u2019re starting to write, you\u2019re integrating two acquisitions, you\u2019re navigating through COVID. So, can you just help us think about how you and your team are maybe, balancing some of the balls in the air right now, or keeping them in the air and how you sort of allocate your time, your \u2013 to the day-to-day blocking and tackling of just selling core products. There\u2019s a lot sort of going on right now with the company.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well Ken, there is a lot going on, but I think that we can handle it. We have a strong ambition to grow. We\u2019ve been choiceful about priorities. And so we suspended our business transformation in ERP activity last year in order to make sure that we could focus on dealing with the crisis and keeping people safe for quality and do all the right things for business continuity, and come out stronger, but that was a pause, not a suspension. We paused our activity and we think we\u2019ve got the resources to ramp it back up. even during that pause, we spent some time re-scoping the aligning partners and we\u2019ve actually come out of it with a stronger program and got a lot of data cleansing done that the folks, who\u2019ve been through this before know that\u2019s always an issue. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to handle that \u2013 handle the recovery of our business. And we really are actually quite thrilled about the two acquisitions that we made. We\u2019ve added a great asset in each one of our segments. We think that this has been a great capital allocation decision and the integration of these are pretty straight forward, I think. Mike, do you want to comment on that?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, the integration is growing very well. I mean, the Cholula obviously is more of a plug and play. It\u2019s a lot of co-pack like we said. so that\u2019s a pretty straightforward one and FONA has a great business and as I said before, it\u2019s discrete teams focusing on them and helping integrate into our business. So, it\u2019s not taking away from the base focus we need on the core business, if that\u2019s kind of where you\u2019re going at.\nKen Goldman: Yes. I was just curious, but that\u2019s a helpful answer. Thank you, gentlemen.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So, my first question actually goes to e-commerce. I just wonder where you ended up for fiscal 2020 in terms of e-commerce as a percent of sales and has that slowed down at all in the later part of the year, I\u2019m just wondering what the prognosis is in terms of growth on that side.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, we\u2019ve had tremendous growth in e-commerce. As we went through the year, we\u2019ve talked about this a couple of times and then told as everybody else and I know our own experiences anecdotally, are that many of us that shop on the e-commerce. if you take all three legs of e-commerce, as we think about it, CTC, pure-play and our click and collect type customer brick and mortar efforts, all of that was up well over 100% percent on a global scale. And while we don\u2019t actually disclose the total percentage of our business, that is from e-commerce. On the consumer side, it\u2019s less than 10%, but it\u2019s up substantially from past years and continuing a long trend of shift by consumers to shopping with e-commerce.\nAlexia Howard: Right. And as my follow-up, as Ken mentioned, there\u2019s an awful lot of uncertainty out there. We\u2019re still living through these unprecedented times. If you think about your outlook for 2021, what do you think the biggest uncertainties off maybe, positively and negatively in terms of the risks in either direction? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I think the biggest uncertainty is, I mean, it\u2019s also the most obvious one, is the pace of recovery from the pandemic and durability of the consumer coming out of it. And the \u2013 and really, it\u2019s more of the recovery of the food service side that we wonder about then the \u2013 whether consumers are going to continue to cook at home. I think there\u2019s \u2013 I think that there\u2019s a pretty broad range of possible outcomes with, again, vaccine take up two variants that might come up. So, those are some pretty \u2013 I\u2019d say, that\u2019s the biggest uncertainty factor out there. We\u2019ll say, we\u2019re managing through this now on a much more, I\u2019d say, managed and operational basis rather than in a crisis mode. So, I think we\u2019re very well prepared for the possible outcomes in the market. Do you want to add anything, Mike?\nMike Smith: I mean, we\u2019re prepared for any environment. We have broadened diversified portfolio, just like we showed last year to have that kind of sales growth and performance. We can manage any environment. And I think there\u2019s two bars as point as we think there\u2019s consumers trends will be sticky although people will go out more to eat as the vaccine becomes more global, but we think we\u2019ve created some habits that markets go away.\nAlexia Howard: Wonderful. Thank you, I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. Good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, good morning, Robert.\nRobert Moskow: Good morning. I wanted to know about the guidance for the first half of the year. I think you said the earnings growth is going to be back half weighted. but when I look at the first quarter coming up, you seem to have a very easy comparison to a year ago in the core operations, which were down in sales and down in EBIT. I think I and others have a pretty outsized first quarter expectation fundamentally, because of inventory reloading and I guess improving performance in Flavor Solutions as well. So, can you help us think about first quarter a little bit too, you mentioned the tax rate, but other than that, is it actually going to be a strong start in first quarter?\nMike Smith: Hey, Rob. It\u2019s Mike, I\u2019ll take that one. I mean, it\u2019s a great point. I mean, we did highlight the first half, second half story. within the first half, there are two stories also; obviously, it\u2019s an easy comparison, especially from a consumer perspective in the first quarter. I think we\u2019re off to a strong start this year, as you would suspect, as you can see in some of the consumption data in the U.S. primarily. We also know we\u2019re laughing a really strong second quarter. and I think it\u2019s something as you look at your modeling, you want to adjust to those that assumption. tax rate, we know is a really tough comparison in the first quarter compared to last year, which we\u2019ve highlighted, but in the first half, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re going to have COVID costs, it will be across both quarters, primarily in the first half significant investment in A&P as we drive our brands, as we recover really in the first quarter or two, but in the second quarter also. But yes, and also for the second half, as you think about it, our COVID costs are high in the first half. But we began to get them out of the business in the second half or as a year ago that\u2019s when we were really ramping up on things that were expensive relative to COVID. And so, we\u2019ll have the unwinding of that as a bit of a tailwind in the second half of the year as well.\nMike Smith: And you\u2019ll see things like ERP costs built throughout the year. So it would be, again, first half, second half could it be kind of more weighted to the second half.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And a follow-up I was surprised to see Flavor Solutions positive in fourth quarter. And you mentioned it\u2019s really driven by CPG. Is there a way to breakout, how much growth you\u2019re seeing in CPG right now, and how much of a decline you\u2019re seeing in the other half of the Flavor Solutions business, which is more food service oriented. And would you expect that relationship to continue in 2021?\nMike Smith: Yes, I think, I\u2019ll answer that one, Lawrence can add in there. I mean, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re not going to give you percentages, because it really varies by region based on the split of our package versus restaurant. But in the Americas, we\u2019ve seen very strong CPG performance, mid-to-high single-digits offset by similar ranges on the branded food service on the restaurant side. But it\u2019s the mix of the business in regions, which give you that. But overall being positive, we were very thrilled with that. I know a lot of people were surprised by that even though consumer grew very strongly.\nLawrence Kurzius: If I were to point to one thing, or we were \u2013 maybe our sales performance for the fourth quarter was different than our expectations it would be in this area of Flavor Solutions, it was bit stronger across the board that we would have thought we gave that U.S. guidance.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. All right, thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deustche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. So, first I just wanted to ask Lawrence, you\u2019d made a comment early on about the pricing disconnect that we\u2019re seeing in Nielsen. So it just \u2013 I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that, maybe clarify. And what I\u2019m really trying to get out is, I think Andrew had asked the question around the \u2013 if there\u2019s any quantification of what the inventory reload might be in the first half, that would be really helpful.\nLawrence Kurzius: Okay. Well, I think those are two different questions. But on pricing there are two things that are happening in Nielsen that are, that make up look like there\u2019s more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there has been a bit of a channel shift as we\u2019ve gone through the crisis where I\u2019d say regular \u2013 I\u2019d say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels. And it tends to carry a higher price point as a result of that comes through as pricing inflation in the Nielsen data that is really a kind of artificial and that was one of the things that that was pointing to. And then the other is there\u2019s still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board that comes through as a focus of price increase in the Nielsen data. As far as the inventory build, we\u2019ve not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there\u2019s going to be a substantial catch-up on trade stock as we shipped to \u2013 we\u2019ve shipped under consumption now for three quarters. And I think you can expect that we will \u2013as our American supply chain catches up that will \u2013 you\u2019ll start to see shipping above consumption. That consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that, our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. consumer business. And then the market took all of that and there\u2019s still a blasted through, it\u2019s \u2013 but we talk about inventories, if it\u2019s not back room warehouse stock, it\u2019s still, if it\u2019s restocking the shelf itself that that\u2019s part of that. I think that that\u2019s going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how retailers are thinking about, you\u2019d mentioned shelf realignment last year, you\u2019d spend a significant amount of time talking about that at Cagney. And I know some of those efforts were paused. How should we think about the timing of that as we go into this year?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, we do have a reinvention of the spice aisle and it\u2019s an important category management program that is good \u2013 it\u2019s a, win-win, it\u2019s great for the customers, and it\u2019s great for us. Although we didn\u2019t make as much progress on that last year as we would\u2019ve hoped when we were talking about it at Cagney. We were able to impact a little over 5,000 stores last year. So, we did continue that that effort, even with the pandemic going on and we would expect to get a like number of stores again in 2021, which is really between those the two years is quite enough really moves the needle. And so we\u2019re continuing with those efforts that we think are important. This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the in the category. And so we\u2019ve taken a look, as part of this to reduces the number of items in the store for their section. But we\u2019ve also looked at the assortment that we offer and we skew rationalize out a part of the early long tail of products that we have to \u2013 about 250 items in the herb, spice, seasoning and recipe mix category to simplify our sort as well.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelsom with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelsom: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Adam.\nMike Smith: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelsom: Good morning. I just want to maybe clarify a little bit at this point on a channel kind of inventory kind of restocking or getting your the shelf\u2019s restocked, not necessarily in the backward \u2013 inventories restock. at the segment level \u2013 or at the company level, you\u2019re guiding organic revenue growth about 1.5% to 3%, 3.5% a year, for the full year. We\u2019ve talked about kind of there being some unfavorable segment mix. So, presumably we\u2019re going to have expectations of the consumer business being a little below that and Flavor Solutions above that baseline. And the consumer business does have a tailwind of on this restocking benefit. As you think about the first half, because you\u2019ve been under shipping consumption. Now, I understand the consumption comps get exceedingly difficult as you get into March, April, May, but I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the idea that with some inventory, we\u2019re thinking about image of our restock, we\u2019re thinking about kind of flat to up 2% or so consumer growth. And I\u2019m trying to make sure I understand what the moving pieces within that.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well let\u2019s try to address each one of those points, but our expectation is for our Consumer segment to grow in 2021, that independent of the acquisition that we made, many of our categories have been in full supply through the whole crisis, all of this discussion about inventory stocking it GDPs [ph] is predominantly in herbs by the seasoning of recipe mixes, the growth is going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. I mean, we\u2019re going to lap some extraordinary consumption. So, well consumption is still running strong for us, the most recent period is still 11.5% and that includes the fact that we\u2019ve got all of those gaps on the shelf. And that is really strong and quite elevated. I compare it to over 50% consumption growth in Q2 and I believe the number 40 something that has already some of the numbers up at the tip of my fingers right now. In Q3 and so we\u2019re in a lockdown, and those are some pretty tough comps in the consumer business for the Americas, and not exactly the same numbers, but comparable peaks coming across EMEA, so that\u2019s, going to be a bit of a headwind as we go pass those.\nMike Smith: I think we have talk about a lot of Flavor Solutions business being a little lumpy, because it\u2019s based on customer demand and things like that consumer will be lumpy this year, because of the quarterly comparisons so much happened last year by quarter, that you\u2019re going to have to \u2013 we\u2019re going to help you through that, but we\u2019re giving broad guidance for the year, which makes it a little difficult because most of us have already forgotten 2020.\nAdam Samuelsom: Okay. And then I have a quick follow-up just talked about low single-digit kind of raw material cost inflation. Maybe this is more for Mike, just maybe go through some of the key buckets in terms of there\u2019s freight packaging any specific pockets of on the actual raw materials that are leading more concerning from the inflationary side that we should be focused on that?\nMike Smith: Well, as far as financial [ph], we have a broad market after the things, which were very different than our peers. And you have the normal big volume items somewhere up and somewhere down. But nothing stands out particularly, I mean, we all know everyone in the industry is getting hit recently by ocean freight and other freight strength. That\u2019s in \u2013 that\u2019s in our market basket. So, we say low single-digits, we don\u2019t break it out, but 70% of our costs are really it\u2019s really raw material and packaging. So that\u2019s, but there\u2019s, there\u2019s nothing I would say that is crazy at this point.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think the bigger impact, frankly, is the incremental and extraordinary expenses for dealing with the COVID crisis that, right now running through our business that we expect to get out right as we get the second half.\nAdam Samuelsom: Okay. So that\u2019s really helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The final question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Lawrence, maybe just to go back to Andrew Lazar\u2019s question, around China, I guess maybe what\u2019s underappreciated is the idea that organic growth and consumer probably realize at least to some extent on China food service, making a pretty remarkable comeback. We\u2019ve heard about some retrenchment there recently, I think in your prepared remarks, you said as well, can you just maybe give us a look into how you\u2019re thinking about that recovery of your China food service customers for the balance of 2021 and then I have a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I\u2019ll speak broadly about China. I\u2019m expecting that we\u2019re going to have a very strong recovery in China. China had a very strong response to the COVID crisis with a very comprehensive lockdown. Consumers did not have a chance to shop, and so the results in China the first and second quarter last year were really depressed. And so I expect to see a very strong rebound from that as we lapse those numbers. And additionally, I think there\u2019s a little bit of a benefit from Chinese New Year being slept with later this year than last year, some of our Chinese New Year volumes that would normally ship at the end of our fiscal year actually is falling into fourth quarter. So that\u2019s going to be also adds a favorable comparison.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Now that\u2019s helpful. And Mike, maybe just\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: For the last quarter...\nPeter Galbo: Right. And Mike maybe just one cleanup, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s been in your outlook there, if you would given on interest expense, but just anything that would be helpful.\nMike Smith: No, I mean, obviously you can calculate. We talked about our assumptions on the acquisitions for \u2013 in the models. So that\u2019s an incremental cost in 2021, and we\u2019ll get a natural decline in some other base parts of the portfolio is we aggressively pay down that last year.\nLawrence Kurzius: But overall interest is off obviously. And, Peter, it\u2019s related to your question. We spent up on A&P in the fourth quarter and every region of the world, including in China to make sure that our consumer business was off to a strong start. The A&P is not test for immediate business performance but for long-term brand building and China was one of the markets that we invested additional A&P and in the fourth quarter of last year, that will help us get a good start on 2021.\nPeter Galbo: Thanks very much guys.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks. Thank you. I will now turn the floor over to Lawrence Kurzius for his closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth of reach of our balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance during volatile times, I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick performed during 2020, we drove outstanding, underlying operating performance, storing unprecedented times. I\u2019ll prioritize in the safety and health of our employees and supporting the communities in which we operate. We expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities from our relative strength. Our investments provide a new foundation for growth, enhancing our agility and our relevance with consumers and customers, which positions as well for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence and thanks everyone for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions regarding today\u2019s information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes this morning\u2019s call. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4. Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020, despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product, our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment. We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain, and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, two fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond. As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantage global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels, the breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers, and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile time as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home, our at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged goods company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other food service customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption in each, as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. In our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum, and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sale, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation. This morning, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go and more depth on the quarter end fiscal year results, as well as the details of our 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 6, starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line versus the year-ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4% with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19 related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income for the partial offset for lower interest expense. Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7 in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6%, on constant currency 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing and scanner data. As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter, due to the sustained increase in demand to protect our top selling holiday items. We had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. In consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores, as well as some impact from the lower promotional activity. Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio, and spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate, and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buyer rates. Our fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraint, it had double-digit growth for the year as its spices and seasonings and the other key categories. In the fourth quarter, we continue to gain share and categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinades and Asian products. The majority of our categories continued to outpace the total store, and center-of-store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth as McCormick branded consumptions outpacing all major categories. But we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly-elevated level of our fourth quarter. We do expect continued at long lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home, the most recent IRI scanner sales data for the five weeks ending January 17. So, total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again. In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on a holiday proving to be successful. In our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen or digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity after trial, an increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and we'll continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation. Now, turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% of the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continued to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region at several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets and our Vahine brand in France, again, had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. In the UK, Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share and spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness and branded food service products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The food service industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace. growth in China was also impacted quite a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia. Turning to Slide 8, our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to grow in the fourth quarter. For the constant currency sales increase of 3% in all three regions contributed to the sales growth in both our Americas and EMEA region, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products. Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines and our away-from-home customer base for branded food service and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded food service growth of 2%. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers. But we continue to see momentum and limited time offers as a core business, partially driven by the customer's promotional activities. Moving from our fourth quarter results, I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we've achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment led by consumers cooking and eating more at home, partially offsetting this growth was at 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment. COVID-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out reduced demand from restaurants and other food service customers. We achieved $113 million of annual cost savings driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings. 2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations, ending the year at over $1 billion, the 10% increase from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements. At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Now, I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly at 2020, which we were well-prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift increased online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead. We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing of 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter, across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again, recognized as we were ranked as the number one food brand with the highest designation of Genius by Gartner L2 Research and their digital IQ U.S. ranking. This is the seventh year in a row, we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands. We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. In 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc's Top 50 companies. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as number one in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year, as well as the number one U.S. company overall and globally, number six overall. Finally, during the year, we continue to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art Northeast Distribution Center in Maryland, which will optimize their distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the UK to support the region strong and growing customer base. In China, we were investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. these investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum. Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on a recent acquisition announcement and provide highlights related to our growth momentum in 2021 plans. Starting on Slide 11, an addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms. There's the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors and presets the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration more value added and technically insulated products. We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its product and expand its product offerings into new flavors, formats, and eating a cadence to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. In our Flavor Solutions segment with our broad presence across all food service channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand a little as distribution and its existing food service channels, as well as increased new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends expands to the recipe inspiration and Flavor Solutions that we offer operators. Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth and developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength. We're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. we're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods. We're putting expertise in favoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio, as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus fruit flavors. Combination of our technology platform and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better for you, and consumer-preferred flavor solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. Our complimentary customer basis of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA's customer centric culture is very similar to ours and with the combined power of our organizations; we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition. We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plan. This confidence is bolstered by our proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance acquired businesses such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy in both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisition. Now, I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plans starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. we're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands, as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio sustainably positions us for a continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions, and a robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments. Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which has real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in food service, which in China is in our Consumer segment. As well as optimism about the Chinese New Year Holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown. And in Australia, either with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption and we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same as in the Americas. Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better tasting and cost less. And while there has been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home, will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new product and our strong category management initiatives. Our categories across the globe experienced the sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020, because of this shift in consumer preference, which coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity deplete its finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. Currently, service levels are improving and the restoration plants have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top selling product. We've now resumed shipping approximately two thirds of the products, which had been suspended, but the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both of our \u2013 both our customers and McCormick. Now, I'd like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021 and have implemented the efficient long-term solutions, and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth. Also in the U.S., in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings consumers by introducing new merchandising elements, to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021 and with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth. Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action by targeting messaging focused on providing information and inspiration. For instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and products, keep the meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020. New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last three years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumer. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. Overall, the selling of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers, slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on the retail shelf. Moving into 2021. We're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and I've seen various stages of recovery from a food at home perspective our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned, last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum, packaged food customers into 2021, driven by strength and their core iconic product, as well as new products and bigger bet innovations in 2021. In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other food service customers are still impacted by government imposed COVID-19 restrictions in those markets. Some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as of the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models for delivery carried out. The recovery of our branded food service customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences. Overall, there is significant disruption experience in 2020. Recovery has begun and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and food service industry. We had positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We were advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement and Flavor Solutions, and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships. Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories, we'll continue in 2021. With top-line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale or momentum in flavor categories, as well as the opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy. In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment at positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery, and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. All of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020s level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our fundamentals momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum, reinforce our confidence and delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying based business performance and acquisitions, driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization. Our top tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time. Now, I'd like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement, as well as adapted to this new environment. Now, Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance. Thank you, Mike. As Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35. We delivered strong results in 2020, despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies. We have a strong foundation. We're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption, ends with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We're excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiments flavors growth platform. We're confident these investments further position us for continued success. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflect another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We're confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times. Now, let's turn to your questions. Hey, good morning, Andrew. Sure. Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter \u2013 certainly, through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls and anybody that walks into the store can see that the shelves are pretty poor condition. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings. The recipe mix is that, reflects the fact that we've had our secondary skews on suspension to protect the key holiday items and it's really been those two categories that had the greatest impact that our other product categories have had a pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. We have, starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on, as we said in our prepared remarks about two thirds of them, have been reinstated and remainder coming in the coming weeks. So, I think we'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next over the next few weeks. we still are allocating products. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries, being a bit fair during this time as well. So, we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year and that we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of tumor inventory. I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. Just the scale of our consumer business and the Americas is so great. Particularly, in the fourth quarter of the year, even in normal circumstances, we have to pre-build inventory to supply that a huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year; and coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have surface issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. as we'll say, just commenting on current conditions and I don't want to get too much into 2021, we're almost two thirds of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers while we're always still allocating products. It's the best service that we've had since the spring. Andrew, there are a couple of other companies I've commented on it and I'll just say it again. Our consumer research, both the syndicated information that we get in our own proprietary research says consumers are enjoying cooking more at home. Three out of four consumers say it relaxes them and reduces their stress, fully up poorer consumers say they actually tend to cook more at home after the pandemic, then they are even now and with the added uncertainty around the vaccine timing and the take-up of the vaccine and do a variance emerging, I think that there's a lot of reasonably consumptions going to be elevated this year, at least for quite some time. Hey, Ken. Sure. Well, Ken, first of all, pricing is an ongoing discussion with customers. I don't want to get too specific about pricing actions that haven't been taken, because of customer and competitive reasons on the end. And so our comments on that are pretty limited right now. I'll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are the Flavor Solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on a contractual relationship for this, a pass-through of pricing. I don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe, some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. We are seeing cost inflations, freight is up, ocean freight in particular, is an emerging \u2013 current and emerging concern, but really, not prepared to talk about make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions and where we need to take pricing in 2021, we're confident we can take it. Well Ken, there is a lot going on, but I think that we can handle it. We have a strong ambition to grow. We've been choiceful about priorities. And so we suspended our business transformation in ERP activity last year in order to make sure that we could focus on dealing with the crisis and keeping people safe for quality and do all the right things for business continuity, and come out stronger, but that was a pause, not a suspension. We paused our activity and we think we've got the resources to ramp it back up. even during that pause, we spent some time re-scoping the aligning partners and we've actually come out of it with a stronger program and got a lot of data cleansing done that the folks, who've been through this before know that's always an issue. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to handle that \u2013 handle the recovery of our business. And we really are actually quite thrilled about the two acquisitions that we made. We've added a great asset in each one of our segments. We think that this has been a great capital allocation decision and the integration of these are pretty straight forward, I think. Mike, do you want to comment on that? Thank you. Good morning, Alexia. Well, we've had tremendous growth in e-commerce. As we went through the year, we've talked about this a couple of times and then told as everybody else and I know our own experiences anecdotally, are that many of us that shop on the e-commerce. if you take all three legs of e-commerce, as we think about it, CTC, pure-play and our click and collect type customer brick and mortar efforts, all of that was up well over 100% percent on a global scale. And while we don't actually disclose the total percentage of our business, that is from e-commerce. On the consumer side, it's less than 10%, but it's up substantially from past years and continuing a long trend of shift by consumers to shopping with e-commerce. Well, I think the biggest uncertainty is, I mean, it's also the most obvious one, is the pace of recovery from the pandemic and durability of the consumer coming out of it. And the \u2013 and really, it's more of the recovery of the food service side that we wonder about then the \u2013 whether consumers are going to continue to cook at home. I think there's \u2013 I think that there's a pretty broad range of possible outcomes with, again, vaccine take up two variants that might come up. So, those are some pretty \u2013 I'd say, that's the biggest uncertainty factor out there. We'll say, we're managing through this now on a much more, I'd say, managed and operational basis rather than in a crisis mode. So, I think we're very well prepared for the possible outcomes in the market. Do you want to add anything, Mike? Hey, good morning, Robert. If I were to point to one thing, or we were \u2013 maybe our sales performance for the fourth quarter was different than our expectations it would be in this area of Flavor Solutions, it was bit stronger across the board that we would have thought we gave that U.S. guidance. Thank you. Okay. Well, I think those are two different questions. But on pricing there are two things that are happening in Nielsen that are, that make up look like there's more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there has been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis where I'd say regular \u2013 I'd say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels. And it tends to carry a higher price point as a result of that comes through as pricing inflation in the Nielsen data that is really a kind of artificial and that was one of the things that that was pointing to. And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board that comes through as a focus of price increase in the Nielsen data. As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch-up on trade stock as we shipped to \u2013 we've shipped under consumption now for three quarters. And I think you can expect that we will \u2013as our American supply chain catches up that will \u2013 you'll start to see shipping above consumption. That consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that, our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. consumer business. And then the market took all of that and there's still a blasted through, it's \u2013 but we talk about inventories, if it's not back room warehouse stock, it's still, if it's restocking the shelf itself that that's part of that. I think that that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year. Well, we do have a reinvention of the spice aisle and it's an important category management program that is good \u2013 it's a, win-win, it's great for the customers, and it's great for us. Although we didn't make as much progress on that last year as we would've hoped when we were talking about it at Cagney. We were able to impact a little over 5,000 stores last year. So, we did continue that that effort, even with the pandemic going on and we would expect to get a like number of stores again in 2021, which is really between those the two years is quite enough really moves the needle. And so we're continuing with those efforts that we think are important. This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the in the category. And so we've taken a look, as part of this to reduces the number of items in the store for their section. But we've also looked at the assortment that we offer and we skew rationalize out a part of the early long tail of products that we have to \u2013 about 250 items in the herb, spice, seasoning and recipe mix category to simplify our sort as well. Good morning, Adam. Well let's try to address each one of those points, but our expectation is for our Consumer segment to grow in 2021, that independent of the acquisition that we made, many of our categories have been in full supply through the whole crisis, all of this discussion about inventory stocking it GDPs [ph] is predominantly in herbs by the seasoning of recipe mixes, the growth is going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. I mean, we're going to lap some extraordinary consumption. So, well consumption is still running strong for us, the most recent period is still 11.5% and that includes the fact that we've got all of those gaps on the shelf. And that is really strong and quite elevated. I compare it to over 50% consumption growth in Q2 and I believe the number 40 something that has already some of the numbers up at the tip of my fingers right now. In Q3 and so we're in a lockdown, and those are some pretty tough comps in the consumer business for the Americas, and not exactly the same numbers, but comparable peaks coming across EMEA, so that's, going to be a bit of a headwind as we go pass those. I think the bigger impact, frankly, is the incremental and extraordinary expenses for dealing with the COVID crisis that, right now running through our business that we expect to get out right as we get the second half. Hey, Peter. Well, I'll speak broadly about China. I'm expecting that we're going to have a very strong recovery in China. China had a very strong response to the COVID crisis with a very comprehensive lockdown. Consumers did not have a chance to shop, and so the results in China the first and second quarter last year were really depressed. And so I expect to see a very strong rebound from that as we lapse those numbers. And additionally, I think there's a little bit of a benefit from Chinese New Year being slept with later this year than last year, some of our Chinese New Year volumes that would normally ship at the end of our fiscal year actually is falling into fourth quarter. So that's going to be also adds a favorable comparison. For the last quarter... But overall interest is off obviously. And, Peter, it's related to your question. We spent up on A&P in the fourth quarter and every region of the world, including in China to make sure that our consumer business was off to a strong start. The A&P is not test for immediate business performance but for long-term brand building and China was one of the markets that we invested additional A&P and in the fourth quarter of last year, that will help us get a good start on 2021. Great. Thanks. Thank you. I will now turn the floor over to Lawrence Kurzius for his closing remarks. Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth of reach of our balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance during volatile times, I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick performed during 2020, we drove outstanding, underlying operating performance, storing unprecedented times. I'll prioritize in the safety and health of our employees and supporting the communities in which we operate. We expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities from our relative strength. Our investments provide a new foundation for growth, enhancing our agility and our relevance with consumers and customers, which positions as well for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full-year results as well as detailed on our 2021 outlook. Starting on Slide 19, during the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume index in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year, pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments. The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions. On Slide 20, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases with volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings, and recipe mixes as well as private label products due to capacity constraints. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers for our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, our Vahine homemade dessert products and our Kamis branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined to 10% in constant currency, driven by the lower branded food service sales, and a shift to a later Chinese New Year as Lawrence mentioned. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 23, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales, 3% with growth in all three regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover costs increases, also partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded food service and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand from package group companies with particular strength in snacks seasoning. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5% attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increase driven by sales growth with packaged food company with strengthened snack seasonings partially offset by lower sales to branded food service and other restaurant customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period, with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth and in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline of branded food service sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. As seen on Slide 28, gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year-ago period as we have planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago, as well as higher distribution and transportation costs. For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix, resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19 related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% at constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense, and COVID-19 related costs. In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19 related costs and higher incentive compensation expense with a partial offset from CCI-led cost savings. Turning to income taxes on Slide 29, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year-ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full year was comparable to 2019. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year-ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year. On Slide 32, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion. A 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. We've returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9 times and we expect to delever to approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt pay down and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan. Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment, and beginning of supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend all the initiatives we have in progress, as well as support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends to paying down debt. Now, I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34 with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million to $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023 with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impacts for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimates. In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will spend approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this some investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantage flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, which with earnings growth, partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment, as well as the projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated two percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. At the top line, we expect to grow the constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021, that's compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs, and of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a low level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact that I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs or incremental ERP investment and the tax headwinds. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96 compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments, as well as the low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year, but recognized we are lapping in a very strong second quarter of 2020. In summary, we are projecting a strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs in the ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions. Yes, we are, but it's not quite as clean in China. Because in China, they factually reinstated some restrictions, that's not the same as it was a year ago, where there was a government lockdown. but the government is encouraging people not to travel, is encouraging people to celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Generally, in China when the government gives encouragement to do something to do it. And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior. It's not quite as clean as in Australia, where COVID seems to be under control, restrictions have been lifted, and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home. In 2021, Chinese New Year is \u2013 later in the first quarter, so it will \u2013 after that have done, we'll have a better read on it. Yeah, I think so. Yes. I mean, the integration is growing very well. I mean, the Cholula obviously is more of a plug and play. It's a lot of co-pack like we said. so that's a pretty straightforward one and FONA has a great business and as I said before, it's discrete teams focusing on them and helping integrate into our business. So, it's not taking away from the base focus we need on the core business, if that's kind of where you're going at. I mean, we're prepared for any environment. We have broadened diversified portfolio, just like we showed last year to have that kind of sales growth and performance. We can manage any environment. And I think there's two bars as point as we think there's consumers trends will be sticky although people will go out more to eat as the vaccine becomes more global, but we think we've created some habits that markets go away. Hey, Rob. It's Mike, I'll take that one. I mean, it's a great point. I mean, we did highlight the first half, second half story. within the first half, there are two stories also; obviously, it's an easy comparison, especially from a consumer perspective in the first quarter. I think we're off to a strong start this year, as you would suspect, as you can see in some of the consumption data in the U.S. primarily. We also know we're laughing a really strong second quarter. and I think it's something as you look at your modeling, you want to adjust to those that assumption. tax rate, we know is a really tough comparison in the first quarter compared to last year, which we've highlighted, but in the first half, as we've talked about, we're going to have COVID costs, it will be across both quarters, primarily in the first half significant investment in A&P as we drive our brands, as we recover really in the first quarter or two, but in the second quarter also. But yes, and also for the second half, as you think about it, our COVID costs are high in the first half. But we began to get them out of the business in the second half or as a year ago that's when we were really ramping up on things that were expensive relative to COVID. And so, we'll have the unwinding of that as a bit of a tailwind in the second half of the year as well. And you'll see things like ERP costs built throughout the year. So it would be, again, first half, second half could it be kind of more weighted to the second half. Yes, I think, I'll answer that one, Lawrence can add in there. I mean, we're seeing \u2013 we're not going to give you percentages, because it really varies by region based on the split of our package versus restaurant. But in the Americas, we've seen very strong CPG performance, mid-to-high single-digits offset by similar ranges on the branded food service on the restaurant side. But it's the mix of the business in regions, which give you that. But overall being positive, we were very thrilled with that. I know a lot of people were surprised by that even though consumer grew very strongly. Good morning, Adam. I think we have talk about a lot of Flavor Solutions business being a little lumpy, because it's based on customer demand and things like that consumer will be lumpy this year, because of the quarterly comparisons so much happened last year by quarter, that you're going to have to \u2013 we're going to help you through that, but we're giving broad guidance for the year, which makes it a little difficult because most of us have already forgotten 2020. Well, as far as financial [ph], we have a broad market after the things, which were very different than our peers. And you have the normal big volume items somewhere up and somewhere down. But nothing stands out particularly, I mean, we all know everyone in the industry is getting hit recently by ocean freight and other freight strength. That's in \u2013 that's in our market basket. So, we say low single-digits, we don't break it out, but 70% of our costs are really it's really raw material and packaging. So that's, but there's, there's nothing I would say that is crazy at this point. No, I mean, obviously you can calculate. We talked about our assumptions on the acquisitions for \u2013 in the models. So that's an incremental cost in 2021, and we'll get a natural decline in some other base parts of the portfolio is we aggressively pay down that last year."

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, and for 2019 the net non-recurring benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. In addition, as a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. It is important to note, these statements include expectations and assumptions which will be shared related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors including the impacts of COVID-19 that could affect our financial results. It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The last few months have been an extraordinary period, and the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve daily. I'm incredibly proud the way McCormick performed in this unprecedented operating environment. Starting on Slide 4, let me highlight a few points on the current condition that we're seeing and their potential impacts. First, in our consumer segments around the world, we are experiencing strong sustained consumer demand, which has real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. In China, which is viewed as a leading indicator since their COVID-19 recovery is ahead of the rest of the world, the demand for food at home continues to be very strong. We see the same in Europe, and, of course, in the Americas. The significant shift to consumers eating more at home is persisting long enough that it has become a habit. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by other research indicates a majority of consumers are cooking more from scratch, enjoying the cooking experience and adding flavor to their meal occasion. These new behaviors coupled with some consumer discomfort for dining out are driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home. We believe this will continue globally and thus further benefit our consumer segment. Turning to our flavor solutions segment, where we have a very diverse customer portfolio. We are seeing varying stages of recovery. Starting with the away from home portion of this segment, with our quick service restaurant customers or QSR, we are seeing strong signs of recovery. Their business models were already oriented to drive through or carry out, not dining in. In China QSR traffic has returned to near normal level, and the limited time offers and promotions are driving demand. In the rest of the APZ region as well as EMEA and Americas, the focus has been on core menu items. So moving into the fourth quarter, we see limited time offerings beginning to reserve. Across the rest of the food service, while it has shown signs of recovery since our second quarter, the pace is much slower and varies by channel and market. As we have previously mentioned, we expect the recovery in this area of the business to be more gradual and take time, likely years, as restaurants and other food service venues such as stadiums and cafeterias, continue to be largely closed or operating under capacity limitations. Consumers are reluctant to dine out, and the restaurant industry has experienced significant pain. From the food at home perspective, our flavor solutions growth varies by packaged food customer, but overall, we're returning to pre-COVID-19 level, as expected. New product opportunities, which had slowed during the crisis and have been more focused on expansion of the core, are beginning to gain increased momentum, and we\u2019re excited about their contribution to growth next year. In summary, for our total flavor solutions segment, business is gradually rebounding, though not yet the 2019 level. Moving to our global supply chain, coming into the crisis, there was more finished goods inventory in the system, both for us and our customers, which was depleted early in the crisis. The sustained, elevated level of demand coupled with our added employee safety measures, has challenged our manufacturing operations. Service has been stressed in some areas and inventory replenishment will take some time. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, that we've had to suspend or curtail production with some secondary products to meet demand for our top selling products. While the rest of the world is also experiencing elevated consumer demand, they've not experienced the same level of manufacturing pressure, given the capacity and capabilities we've built outside of the Americas in the past few years. In EMEA, where our supply chain is very well-positioned to meet demand, we've gained distribution as other manufacturers have faced challenges. For the Americas, as we said on our earnings call in June, we're expanding our workforce and increasing manufacturing capacity through optimized scheduling and investment, particularly around blending capacity, as well as scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturer. To be clear, this added capacity is still ramping up. This capacity just started to come online in August, and will continue to ramp up over the next few months. And it\u2019s targeted to be completely in place by the end of the calendar year. And by then, we will have added the equivalent of an additional plant for the U.S. manufacturing capacity. Of course, with this rapid scale up, there are extra costs and short-term inefficiency, but we're confident we're implementing efficient long-term solution. The investments we're making are not just to meet the higher demand for the balance of 2020, but to strengthen our supply chain resiliency longer-term, and to support the America's consumer growth, we anticipate continuing into next year, driven by both sustained demand as well as retailer inventory replenishment. We're making good progress. Our service levels continued to improve and we're confident in our capabilities and ability to meet demand, particularly during the holiday season. We're positioning ourselves for continued success. I want to thank our supply chain employees for their remarkable efforts, as well as our suppliers and customers for their partnership in this challenging environment. The positive fundamentals we have in place have enabled us to manage through this period of volatility. The investments we've made and the capabilities we\u2019ve built, combined with our strong business models, prepared us to execute from a position of strength. As the crisis subsides, we will emerge an even better company, by driving our long-term strategy, responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength. Now, I'd like to focus on our third quarter performance, business update on our consumer and flavor solutions segments and our 2-for-1 stock split announcement. As seen on Slide 6, we have a broad and advantage global flavor portfolio, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced by our third quarter results. During the third quarter, the shift in consumer behavior to cooking even more at home or at home consumption, drove a substantial increase in our consumer segments demand, as well as increases with our packaged food company customers and our flavor solutions segment. On the other hand, we experienced the decline in demand from our restaurants and other food service customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio, which historically has represented approximately 20% of our total annual company's sales. The impact of this shift more at home consumption varied by region, due to the different levels of away-from-home consumption in each, as seen on Slide 6, as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offerings, but we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, underlying consumer demand continues to underpin our growth. Now let me cover the highlights of our third quarter, which were broadly in line with the trends we discussed in our earnings call in June. Starting with our topline, third quarter sales increased 8% from a year ago period. In constant currency sales grew 9%, mainly attributable to significantly higher volume and product mix in our consumer segment, with a partial offset from a low single digit decline in our flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income increased 5%, including 1% unfavorable impact from currency. These results were driven by higher sales, favorable mix primarily driven by the sales mix between segments. And CCI-led cost savings partially offset by higher costs, including those related to COVID-19. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.53, 5% higher than the year ago period of $1.46, driven primarily by our strong operating performance. With one quarter left in the year, we have resumed guidance and expect to deliver another year of strong profitable growth. Our results continued to be driven by the engagement of our employees and the successful execution of our strategy. And we're confident in our 2020 outlook, which will be covered in detail in a few moments. Now, let me spend a few minutes on our business segment update. Starting on Slide 8, with our consumer segment, sales rose 15% with minimal impact from currency, fueled by the change in consumer behavior. Research and trend data show that not only are consumers cooking more at home, they're enjoying it, both from a flavor and family experience, and have even accelerated their use of spices, seasonings and condiments, as the pandemic has progressed. Additionally, as at home consumption from restaurant carryout and delivery is increasing, many consumers are adding flavor what spices, sauces or condiments they have at home. We believe these trends will last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and drive continued growth. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 17% in the third quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 28%, which is substantial and reflects the strength of our category, as consumers cook more at home. Our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth attributable to a few factors. First, the service level pressures and product allocation from the supply chain challenges, I mentioned previously. Next, the timing of the holiday program we offer retailers. We generally offer the program during our third quarter to encourage early in store display and merchandising of holiday products. The impact of this program was included in our third quarter shipments in 2019. In 2020, though, with the elevated level of demand and focus on keeping core items on shelf, a portion of retailer purchases for this program has shifted to our fourth quarter. Notwithstanding this shift, we still expect another year of strong holiday execution. And lastly, increased level of pricing growth in the scanner data, due to curtailed third quarter promotions and channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores. Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio, consumption in all key categories grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter, with the majority of our categories continuing to outpace the total store and centers for growth rates. In fact, consumption in our portfolio during the third quarter, grew 2.5 times the center of store rate, which is an increase from the comparison in the second quarter. But we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our third quarter. We do expect continued and long lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the week ended September 13, shows McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption still growing over 20%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. We gained share at seven out of 11 categories during the third quarter, those which were less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. While there was noise in the third quarter share numbers for categories impacted by supply, such as spices and seasonings dry recipe mixes and mustard, on a year-to-date basis were relatively flat or gaining share in those categories too. New products launched earlier in the year such as Frank's RedHot thick sauces, Old Bay hot sauce and Stubb\u2019s reduced sugar barbecue sauce, have continued to get exceptional trial and contributed to the third quarter growth. The sell-in of our second-half new product launches however has been slowed due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. And these launches will now be further opportunities to fuel growth next year. The slow performance across household penetration and the rate of repeat buyers continued in the third quarter across our portfolio. Our household penetration rate increased 8% compared to last year, driving a significant amount of trial for millions of new households across multiple categories. Spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes and hot sauces has the biggest gain, but even smaller brands like Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen grew significantly, and their rate of repeat buyers increased 7% during the quarter, with double digit repeat rates in many categories. These metrics increasing significantly, both in our second quarter and third quarter indicates a high level of usage and speaks to the stickiness of our product. Consumers are coming into our brands, having a good experience and buying our products again. With our high level of effective brand marketing assessments, including planned increases in the fourth quarter, and our initiatives to deepen our digital connection with consumer, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity after trial and increase usage by existing consumer. We're continuing to design targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home, teaching consumers how to use our products and providing a flavor inspiration. And as the younger generation continues to fuel the demand for flavor, and everyone has accelerated their online presence, we're executing on creative ways to connect with them. For instance, one way we're connecting with consumers is by helping them discover new ways to enjoy time honored tradition. Take Tailgating for example, with football season now in full swing, we partnered with former New York Giants Quarterback, Eli Manning to create the largest virtual homegating experience, having the lucky fans interact with Eli to learn about his favorite Frank's RedHot flavor snacks, the recent event garnered over 750 million media impressions across digital media platform. Moving from the football season to the holiday season, our fourth quarter is an important one from a seasonal standpoint. Our consumer's holiday dinner may be more important than ever this year, and we're excited about helping make them memorable flavor experiences. In terms of brand marketing, we're launching a holiday version of our 'It's Gonna Be Great' campaign, which recognize that celebrations might be different this year, in addition to our normal holiday promotion activities. And from a supply chain standpoint, we're protecting our top selling holiday products. We have confidence, we're well-positioned for a successful holiday season. Our portfolio and the plans we have in place are even more relevant today than they were before the crisis, as we expect the increase in at home cooking to persist. We will continue to drive our category leadership and growth momentum through strong brand marketing, category management initiative and new product innovation. Now turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 23% with broad based growth across the region. Our largest markets drove double digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in our key categories. Importantly, we gained total EMEA region share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. The spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, driven by consumers cooking more at home and discovering they need our products for great tasting, healthy flavor solutions. Our brand marketing campaign highlighting our product superiority and culinary partnership, coupled with pivoting or digital messages based on real time consumer insights, with the topics most relevant to consumers and formats that resonate the most are driving spices and seasoning momentum. In the UK, our Schwartz brand new dry recipe mixes, such as One Pan meal seasonings offer a convenient and natural herb and spice blends for vegetarian options, are attracting younger consumers to the category and driving new distribution gains, as well as category growth. We achieved the leading UK market share position in dry recipe mixes at the beginning of the year, and we continue to gain significant market share in the third quarter. And with the momentum in baking continuing, combined with successful new product launches, we again had exceptional consumption of growth in our Vahine brand in France, outpacing the homemade desserts category and gaining share. Notably, Frank's RedHot turned up the heat during the third quarter, with over 40% consumption growth driven partly by a successful digital drilling campaign as well as new distribution. We're gaining millions of new households and driving repeat purchases. Our household penetration increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the third quarter compared to last year, with double digit growth percentages in both the UK and France spices and seasonings categories, as well as in the UK dry recipe mixes and France homemade desserts category. And our rate of repeat buyers in these markets and categories also grew by double digit. Our strong brand marketing and digital campaign, which we've increased in EMEA, provide us with confidence, we will continue growing with our new consumer, while welcoming to our brand as well as our existing value consumer. Moving forward in EMEA, we\u2019ll continue to capture the momentum we've gained and are excited with our growth trajectory, following challenging market conditions over the past few years. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 6%, driven by declines in branded food service products, which are included in our consumer segment in China. Excluding those impacts, sales for the region would have increased, reflecting the increase in consumer demand across the region related to more cooking at home. In China, our consumer to business growth was strong, driven by consumers\u2019 demand for convenient solutions, fueling our growth of recipe mixes, as well as world flavor and hot pot sauces. Continued momentum in condiments also contributed to growth. In other parts of the region, we have broad based growth, led by Australia's strong consumption and share growth in branded spices and seasonings, particularly in Gourmet Garden, with high double digit rates of new consumers and repeat buyers, and Frank\u2019s RedHot with over 50% growth during the pandemic. Finally, in all regions, consumers digital engagement has increased significantly, as we continue to experience accelerated e-commerce growth in all categories, whether it'd be pure play, click and collect or our own direct to consumer property. The pace of growth has slowed from the second quarter, which was heavily impacted by more extensive stay at home period. But we again drove triple digit growth in the third quarter, as well as increasing our market share in several markets. We expect the shift to online shopping behavior to continue, and we're well-positioned for it, through the investments we've made and continue to make in this channel. Our consumer growth plans based on our strategies have been in place since the beginning of the year, and we're yielding the results before the crisis. And we've been able to leverage our initiatives to capitalize on the opportunity to help our consumers during this time and strengthen our category leadership positions, which further bolsters our confidence that we will drive future growth. Turning to Slide 10 in our flavor solution segments, our sales performance improved substantially from our second quarter constant currency decline of 16%. Our third quarter constant currency sales were 1% lower than last year, attributable to lower demand from restaurants and other food service customers, and our Americas and EMEA region, driven by the decline in away from home consumption. Almost, fully offsetting this lower demand, with continued growth in sales for packaged food customers across all regions, as well as strong sales growth to quick service restaurants in China. In the Americas, our sales declined 3% in constant currency, driven by demand declines across both branded food service and restaurant customers. With the branded food service impact more significant, as our away from home customer base in the Americas is skewed more to that channel. We're continuing to work with our customers impacted by away from home consumption declines to manage through their recovery efforts. With our customer intimacy approach, we're collaborating to provide solutions, such as menu simplification and optimization, branded portion controlled packaging for dining-in and carryout, and condiment dispensing solutions for food service operations. We're building menu excitement with strong promoters leveraging the power of our brand, driving wins for both our customers and us. We're excited about new distribution gains as well as upcoming menu participation and limited time offers, as the recovery momentum continues. In EMEA, our sales growth 1% in constant currency, the significant rebound from a 31% decline in our second quarter. Our away from home customer base in this region is skewed more to QSR, and then the third quarter as they reopen with adapted operating model and resumed limited dine-in options, our demand from these customers rebounded, although it's still modestly below the third quarter of last year. The recovery with other food service customers also began in the third quarter, as COVID-19 restrictions eased, although as expected, slower and not to the same extent as QSR. Turning to our at home customer base, we had strong growth in our flavor sales of the packaged food company, similar to pre-COVID-19 levels, driven by the strength in their core iconic products, as well as the momentum from new products launched at the beginning of the year. We're advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in this evolving environment, which has driven continued wins with our EMEA flavor solutions customer. Whether it'd be quickly scaling up to meet aggressive recovery plans, collaborating on opportunities, or managing through demand volatility, we're responding with speed and agility, and further strengthening our customer relationships. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7%, driven by China and Australia's growth of QSR customers. During the third quarter QSRs at these countries were largely open, and we're seeing momentum gaining in the core business and limited time offer and our customers\u2019 promotional activities. Government imposed COVID-19 restrictions and reduced levels of limited time offers continued to curtail growth in parts of the region. For the balance of the year, we expect a reduced level of our customers\u2019 limited time offer and promotional activities versus last year to impact growth. We continue across all regions to be fully committed to helping our customers manage through the COVID-19 recovery phase, of which the duration is still uncertain. The slow and evolving recovery process is dependent on many factors, including restrictions being lifted, venues fully reopening, and possible resurgences. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period of volatility. We remain confident in the successful execution of our strategies driving long-term growth trajectory in flavor solutions. Now before turning it over to Mike and beginning on Slide 11, I'd like to mention stock split we announced this morning and provide a few summary comments, including our 2020 outlook. I'm pleased with our announcement this morning of a 2-for-1 stock split, reflecting our sustained positive performance and outlook for continued growth. It has been 18 years since the last split of stock, which was in 2002, when the pre-split share price was $52.33. We believe this will provide greater liquidity and be appreciated by individual investors and employees. And now in summary, as the foundation of our sales growth is the global demand for flavor, we're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, heritage brands and digital engagement. These long-term trends have not only remained intact during the crisis, they have accelerated. And our alignment with them positions us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our products and our customer products. We're driving sales growth balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins, and sustainably realize earnings growth. We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we are ensuring, we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth. We've delivered outstanding year-to-date results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model. Our strategies are effective and reinforcing our customers, they will continue to drive future growth. Our 2020 outlook, which Mike will discuss in detail in a few moments, reflects the strength of our year-to-date performance and momentum we're carrying into our fourth quarter and 2021. We are exceeding the objectives we had in place at the beginning of the year, delivering stronger sales and underlying operating performance, while importantly also ensuring the health and safety of our employees, investing in our supply chain resiliency to meet growth we expect in 2021, recognizing the exceptional performance of our people throughout the COVID-19 crisis and supporting our communities through relief efforts. Our growth expectation reflects our confidence in the sustainability of higher at home consumption trends. As we look to our fiscal 2021, we expect constant currency organic sales growth in both of our segments on top of the outstanding consumer segment growth this year. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success, and thank them for their efforts, engagements and for adapting to this new environment. It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin now by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance, and then our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Starting on Slide 14, during the third quarter sales were at 9% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by substantially higher volume and mix in our consumer segment, partially offset by lower volume and mix in our flavor solution segment, pricing to partially offset costs inflation also contributed favorably to both segments. Consumer segment sales grew 15% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The shift to at home consumption and cooking more at home, as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery has driven substantial demand for consumer products, driving higher volume and mix in these regions. On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 17% in constant currency, versus the third quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by significant growth across our branded portfolio, including higher volume and product mix of McCormick spices and seasonings, as well as Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Gourmet Garden, Frank's RedHot, Zatarain's, Stubb's, Lawry's and El Guapo products. Additionally, the pricing actions taken prior to COVID-19 in the first quarter, to partially offset increased costs also contributed to the growth. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 23% from a year ago, with double digit volume and mix growth in all countries across the region. The most significant growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros brands in spices and seasonings, our Vahine homemade dessert products and our Schwartz dry recipe mixes. Consumer sales in Asia Pacific declined 6% in constant currency, driven by lower branded food service sales, as Lawrence mentioned. This decline was partially offset by increased consumer demand across the region, with growth led by China's recipe mixes, sauces and condiments, as well as Australia's brand new spices, seasonings and condiments. Turning to our flavor solutions segment on Slide 18, third quarter constant currency sales decreased 1%, driven by declines in away from home products in the portfolios of our Americas and EMEA region. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales declined 3% driven by a significant decline in sales to branded food service customers, in addition to lower sales to quick service restaurants, partially offsetting these declines were increase sales of packaged food companies and pricing to offset costs increases. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 1%, driven by pricing to cover costs increases, also partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix decline, driven by reduction in sales to branded food service customers, in addition to lower sales to quick service restaurant customers, partially offsetting these declines was sales growth with packaged food companies. In the Asia Pacific region, flavor solution sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to quick service restaurants in China and Australia, partially driven by our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. As shown on Slide 22, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges increased 5% in the third quarter versus the year ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income grew by 6% and was driven by substantial growth in the consumer segment, partially offset by a significant decline in the flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income growth in the consumer segment was 18%, increasing to $209 million, or in constant currency was 19%, driven primarily by higher sales. In the flavor solution segment, adjusted operating income declined 24% to $64 million, or 22% in constant currency, driven partially by lower sales, unfavorable product mix due to decline in branded food service sales, and an unfavorable impact to manufacturing costs resulting from the lower volume. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain costs, including those related to additional compensation for our operations employees, safety and sanitation measures and scaling up to meet increased demand, as well as higher incentive compensation, which was driven by our strong year-to-date sales and operating profit performance. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by CCI-led cost saving. Gross profit margin expanded 70 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by favorable product mix, resulting from the sale shift between segments and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating margin compression of 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year was driven by the net impact of the factors, I just mentioned, as well as higher distribution costs. Turning to income taxes on Slide 24, our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 19.3% as compared to 17.6% in the year ago period. Those years were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, principally stock option exercises. Income from unconsolidated operations up $10 million in the third quarter was comparable to the year ago period. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 26, third quarter of 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.53, that's compared to $1.46 for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by our higher adjusted operating income with lower interest expense, offsetting the impact of a higher adjusted income tax rate. This increase also includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On Slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow in the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $627 million for the third quarter of 2020, a 27% increase compared to $495 million for the third quarter of 2019, and was driven by higher net income. We finished the third quarter with a cash conversion cycle at 36 days, down seven days versus our 2019 fiscal year end. We returned $247 million of cash to shareholders through dividends, and used $146 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, we were very happy that during the third quarter, we fully paid off the terms notes related to the acquisition of the Frank\u2019s and French\u2019s brands, and ended the third quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.1 times. We continue to project another year of strong cash flow. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, including through acquisitions, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Let's now move to our 2020 financial outlook. As a reminder, we withdrew our 2020 guidance during our first quarter earnings call in late March. The operating environment over the past six months has continued to evolve, and while there still remains much uncertainty and many variables which can drive a range of possible outcomes, we recognize our year-to-date performance has been strong and we are currently in the last quarter of our fiscal year. As such, we are resuming our 2020 guidance at this time based on the expectations Lawrence shared earlier this morning. Most notably, that the shift in consumer demand in at home consumption versus away from home will continue for the balance of the year, and even beyond. We believe this shift will continue to favorably impact the consumer segment in our fourth quarter. While the away from home part of this flavor solutions portfolio has begun to recover, it will continue to be unfavorably impacted. We expect the impact of both segments will not be to the same extent that we have realized in the past six months. Starting with the topline, we expect to grow sales at the upper end of a 4% to 5% range, which in constant currency is a range of 5% to 6%. This increase is expected to be entirely organic and reflects growth driven by new products, expanded distribution, fair marketing and pricing, which in conjunction with cost savings, is expected to offset anticipated mid-single digit inflationary pressures. It includes the net impact of the shift in demand due to COVID-19 and the consumers sustained preference for cooking at home. Our 2020 gross profit margin is expected to be 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2019, in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix, partially offset by COVID-19-related costs. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects the expected strength of our constant currency sales performance and underlying profit realization, partially offset by higher expenses related to COVID-19 and incentive compensation. We're projected to grow adjusted operating income by 4% to 5%, or 5% to 6% in constant currency. This includes our cost savings targets of approximately $105 million and an expected mid-single digit increase of brand marketing investments. We are estimating our COVID-19 costs, which include expenses related to additional compensation for our frontline operations employees, safety and sanitation measures and scaling up to meet increased demand, as well as donations to relief organizations will be approximately $40 million to $50 million for fiscal year 2020, with the majority of this cost impacted gross profit. Our estimated increase and incentive compensation is driven by our projected strong fiscal year sales and operating profit performance, and is consistent with our commitment to a pay for performance philosophy. Our 2020 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 20%. Based on our year-to-date performance, including the impact of favorable discrete items and the estimated mix of earnings by geography. This outlook compares to our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.5%. Our income from unconsolidated operations is also expected to be impacted by unfavorable currency rates, and as a result, we are projecting a mid-single digit decline. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2020 is $5.64 to $5.72. This compares to $5.35 of adjusted earnings per share in 2019, and represents a 5% to 7% increase, which in constant currency is a 6% to 8% increase. In summary, we are projecting another strong year of underlying operating performance, while doing is right, by first protecting our employees and recognizing their contributions, second, by supporting our communities through relief efforts, and finally, by making supply chain and brand marketing investments to meet our expected growth into fiscal 2021. And while we are not providing guidance for next year, I want to note that we do expect constant currency organic sales growth in both our segments in 2021, as Lawrence mentioned earlier. Additionally, I want to provide you a brief update on our ERP replacement program. We indicated in March that we will rephasing the timing of this program to focus on the challenging environment during the pandemic. We have remained excited and committed to our global transformation initiative. While the environment is still challenging, we have continued to work on this program. The delay provides us an opportunity to do some replanning, and as SAP has improved their product, our ramp up will be on a new version with a broader suite of applications, allowing us to save an upgrade cycle as well. We have not completed our planning yet, but we do not anticipate any major go lives in 2021. We will provide further updates on our ERP program on our earnings call in January. Finally, I would also like to mention that yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split with one share of common stock, with common stock non-voting to be issued for each like outstanding share. The additional shares will be distributed on November 30, and trading is expected to begin on a split adjusted basis on December 1. The stock split reflects the confidence we have in our future, and we believe it will provide greater liquidity and allow the stock to be more accessible to a broad range of investors. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some closing remarks before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and 2020 outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. We've delivered outstanding year-to-date results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company. Our foundation is solid and our strategies are effective. Our 2020 outlook reflects another year of strong operating performance while doing what is right for our employees and communities, as well as making investments for the growth we expect in both segments next year. We're confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment and to continue delivering differentiated results and build long-term value. And now I'd like to turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Andrew. Good morning. Thanks for hanging in there for a very long script.\nAndrew Lazar: No worries, no worries. My pleasure. So two things would be, first off, thanks for your thoughts around your expectations for organic sales into next year. I'm curious as we think about EBIT for next year, obviously, we're not in a position to give any kind of guidance. But maybe you can just cover off on a couple of the discrete items puts and takes that we kind of know about? Meaning, I know covered, Mike $40 million to $50 million of COVID-related costs this year. Is all of that expected to not repeat next year or as a portion go into next year? And then anyway you can break out what the incremental maybe incentive comp cost is expected to be this year? And just any other things that are discrete, that we kind of know now that we should take into account as we think about sort of profit growth next year? And then I've just got a follow-up. Thank you.\nMike Smith: Hey, Andrew, it's Mike. I'll answer this, and if Lawrence has any comments, he can chime in. You referred to the COVID costs. Obviously, we talked about -- this year about $40 million to $50 million incremental costs in 2020. We expect some of those to continue, however, some of those we don't expect to continue. Some of the things like we're scaling up production, we're onboarding people, we've incremental co-packers in place now. We expect that to not impact us into next year. However, some of the things we've done like PPE and other coverage for our employees, we do expect to continue. So it's a mix of that. However, we would be really -- a lot depends on the environment and continued resurgence. So, our January guidance will give you a lot more detail on that obviously.\nLawrence Kurzius: But there is other -- in addition to what Mike said, there are costs that we incurred for temporary plant closure, like extraordinary sanitation that we do not anticipate happening again next year. And just bringing on all of this capacity has been done very quickly. And as a result, it's been brought on somewhat inefficiently in the short-term, and we expect that efficiency rate to go up as we get into next year. Now on incentive comp, Mike mentioned the word about that. I certainly hope that it doesn't -- it's not a tailwind next year. But if it's not, it's because -- if it is at the tailwind, it's because of continued extraordinary performance. We have pay per performance philosophy. Our employees have really delivered this year, and so incentive comp, across the all levels of the organization is pretty much at the top of our program range. And so, it would take a really extraordinary performance to repeat that. So probably it's going to be a tailwind as well, but in any case, the underlying business results that we delivered this year, don't get paid for twice. Our plants pay for growth.\nAndrew Lazar: Yes, it makes sense. And you mentioned capacity, and I want to dig into that a little bit. I'm curious if there's a way to sort of spread out a little bit, how much of the upcoming capacity that's coming online, is sort of internal versus stepped up use of third parties? And really the reason I ask is that, I'd assume that McCormick would not be adding its own sort of internal capacity in any significant way unless it thought that some of these recently elevated trends were likely to persist somewhat longer-term, not at current levels necessarily. But, longer-term in a way that you kind of felt like you needed internal capacity, as opposed to just the more -- as opposed to just accessing the flexibility of third-party manufacturing.\nLawrence Kurzius: So, Andrew. It's actually -- it's a mix. So some of the capacity we've gained has been by adding people and changing our shift patterns so that we have more of our facilities operating on a 24/7 or 25/7 schedule, not just on some lines, but some case on all lines. So that's one way we've added capacity. We have made some short, we've made some -- we've been able to make some investments in blending capacity that are internal. And then we have brought on quite a lot of third-party co-packing capacity that is an incremental cost that we would hope to absorb into our own facilities over the course of next year.\nMike Smith: And that's primarily with a strategic partner that we already did co-packing with also. So we're not creating a quality risk out there at all.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. One clarification and then I have a broader question and just building on Andrew's question. You talked about no major go live for ERP in 2021. Is it fair for us to assume that obviously the costs will be delayed maybe until 2022 as well from that, or there are some costs that you'll incur in advance? Just curious on that first.\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, we're continuing -- even though we talked earlier about delaying the ERP, we're still incurring costs this year, we're going to spend in 2020 around the same level as we did in 2019. So you can expect that we replan this will have cost in next year. We're not prepared at this point to talk about the level of cost, but we just wanted to highlight the fact that, go lives, which are -- bring with them major costs aren't going to really happen until 2022. And we'll have more -- obviously the January guidance will sharpen the pencils for that.\nKen Goldman: Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to poke around a little bit on your commentary about organic growth in the consumer segment next year. The markets right now are looking for -- the streets looking for low-single-digit declines. So you're surprising to the upside, I think. And I wanted to ask, clearly, you have a very strong first quarter coming up, you should anyway, given that you don't lap against COVID. But after that there's some reasonably high bars to comp against. And I'm just curious to what extent is your confidence in this topline growth next year, informed maybe a little bit by the increase in capacity? And also the potential trade load that could bleed from this year into next. And I'm asking, because, obviously, we should continue to see great food at home trends next year. But maybe that guidance will be easier to digest, if it's built on, I guess something more than the expectation of just end demand growth. So hopefully that makes sense.\nLawrence Kurzius: No, Ken, that makes a lot of sense. And that is a great question, because I think you've written about this. And I think that the Analysts community as a group, the consensus that's out there right now under calls, but we think the growth potential is and that's why we have commented on 2021 at this early stage, when we normally would really be focused completely on 2020. Now, even before COVID-19 hit, consumers were cooking more at home, they were using more spices and seasonings and sauces to prepare fresher, healthier meals. They're moving to trusted inherited brands, we talked about this. The pandemic accelerated these trends, and other trends like e-commerce that already underpin our strategies, and that we were already capitalizing on. And consumers haven't been doing anything that is contrary to what they have been trending to do already, they're just doing more of it. The data that we've gotten that we talked about in our prepared remarks, shows that most consumers are cooking more, they're enjoying it, they intend to cook more. And our brands have gained penetration in millions of households with a high level of repeat that shows strong satisfaction with the experiences that they're having. And we're not testing it in the U.S., we're seeing this play out globally. We've continued to invest behind our brands, and driving through the entirety of the crisis. And we've got a robust pipeline of innovation that includes some backlog from this year, but launch in 2021 too. We've added a lot of resilience and capacity in the supply chain. And the market, frankly, has taken all of it. And we're still ramping up for more just to meet the existing demand for consumption. And as you noted, we have store shelves to restock, retailer inventory to replenish and a broad range of suspended SKUs to restart. So yes, we think that there's going to be some moderation, there are going to be a couple of periods and areas where there are tough comparisons. But we absolutely expect growth in our consumer segment next year for a very good reason.\nMike Smith: I think also to highlight the fact that we're upping our spend of brand marketing in the fourth quarter. We're going to have mid -- we've guided the mid-single digits for the year, which would imply 12% to 18% increase in the fourth quarter, because that advertising will drive growth in the first and second quarter. So we're really investing behind the brand at this opportunity.\nKen Goldman: Very clear. Thank you.\nMike Smith: And I don't even need to talk about flavor solutions since everybody could see.\nKen Goldman: No, no. Yes. I think we expect that to be up already. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Alexia.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So can we look out -- I think you mentioned promotional activity was reduced obviously, because of the constraints on supply over the last few months on the consumer side. As you look forward, are the retailers beginning to offer that spending back? I know spices and seasonings are not generally that heavily promoted. But I'm just wondering about the dynamic with retailers there, and whether they're likely to offer an elevated spend as we look out into the tail end of this year and into 2021?\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. Well, all that we've done, first of all, has been done in cooperation and collaboration with retailers. Pretty much through -- much of the third quarter and into fourth our promotional plans are actually in place. But what's different is that the product is on allocation in many cases. And so the amount that retailers can take on the promotion is limited, number one. And then number two, we had a shift in our timing of our holiday program, normally, just because of the scale of the holiday program, we actually start deliveries in August to get displays up already, just to manage the surge. And as part of managing overall demand, we pushed about half of that off into Q4. So there's a timing difference there. But, I think that for the most part, our promotional plans are back in place. Those comments are pretty specific to the U.S. and Canada. And the rest of the world, where we really haven't been constrained by supply promotional plans have gone forward as normal at this point.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And as a follow-up. As you've managed to delever to a little over 3 times net debt to EBITDA. How does that adjust your thinking on acquisitions? Obviously, there's a lot that you've got on your plates just operating within this environment. But in the past, you've been particularly bullish on the idea of doing further deals. I'm just wondering how rich that set of opportunities looks right now. And how actively, you might be pursuing that and in which parts of the business?\nLawrence Kurzius: So it has been our goal to deleverage to 3 times of EBITDA by the end of 2020. It looks like we're certainly there, that's a positive. And our goals for -- our acquisition strategy is unchanged, which is the acquisition support our growth strategies. And so, we've been signaling for a while that that we didn't feel that we actually had to literally get to report a 3.0 before we'd be back in the market. And so, we would say that we're open for business and the acquisition department.\nAlexia Howard: Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Rob, are you there?\nOperator: And Mr. Moskow back to you.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, can you hear me? Sorry about that. Yes, that was me.\nLawrence Kurzius: That\u2019s like the cliche of our time right now.\nRobert Moskow: Yes, that\u2019s happen to many. Yes, I agree with you. But unfortunately, no dogs barking in the background. But I did have just kind of a broader question about your margin structure. You're making investments in capacity this year, that will dilute your margins in fourth quarter. And then you have this big ERP program that will probably dilute margins next year. Just big picture, like would you say that these investments are setting you up to service -- to become a bigger company to service a bigger demand? And if so, like when do you get back to a pattern of margin expansion and benefiting from all that scale that you've put out? And I guess the second part is, do you get back then to your normal pattern of market expansion that's in your long-term algo?\nMike Smith: Hey, that's a great question, Rob. And I'll start it. No, that\u2019s a great point. And as we went into this year, obviously when we had planned a $60 million-ish investment in ERP, that was going to be dilutive to our margin. However, we need to become a bigger company, increase our scale. ERP program drives efficiencies across the organization and really allows us to grow faster and make acquisitions faster. It's hard to pin it down to one year investment and then you get back right away. But over a three or four year period where we look at our constant currency sales growth and our margins, and we see that really as our long-term guidance. One years, you're going to have some short-term ups and downs on it. And there are stake levers we can pull to from an advertising perspective, spending more or less. CCI is a tool we've used in the past to lean into, when we've had investments to make. So I think in January you'll see a better picture for next year.\nLawrence Kurzius: But, the investments that we've made in supply chain this year have really been extraordinary, because of the extraordinary circumstances. We've had an unprecedented increase in demand that has been sustained over time that we have really had to work and almost throw money at in order to meet. And it hasn't been done in the most efficient way. And I think that, as we've commented on the first question from Andrew, we would expect that some of those costs would come out.\nMike Smith: And you think about earlier this year, people have already forgotten the first quarter. China was such a shock to us and everybody, and the consumers there didn't get a chance to really buy. So that was a large first quarter impact for us, which really hurt our margins. Going even in the flavor solutions business, we talked about continuing to mix up there with portfolio management, this year has been a little tough because, food service, Frank food service, which is high margin, has been hurt by this COVID situation, whereas QSRs are recovering that has first and mixed perspective. But we see that over time recovering also.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And I actually do have a follow-up question. You said that Europe had already expanded capacity sufficiently to meet the 20% plus increase in demand, but the U.S. had not. Is there any reason that the capacity expanded in one region, but not the other?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, sure. Over the last several years, we've been building our capacity and capabilities in Asia Pacific first and in Europe second, as an area of investment focus. And actually, we had just turned to the Americas. This year, we announced a big investment in highly automated logistics center earlier this year, pre-COVID. And so, our investment cycle has turned to the Americas, but\u2026\nMike Smith: It's not as we've ignored Americas. We've had investments along the way, but it\u2019s the same region for us right.\nLawrence Kurzius: And virtually all of our plants in Asia have been either new or renovated in the last several years. And we've made a number of big investments in expansion and automation in EMEA and we're just turning to the Americas. But even beyond that, it's just the scale of the surge of demand. I mean, the U.S. business is so big that even the same percentage growth turns into a massive amount of volume.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning. I had a -- the question just to understand, you talked earlier in the call about pushing off some new product launches and how those could benefit 2021, I think was the implication. Is that a function of the retailer sort of acceptance of new products? Are you seeing that kind of pick back up? And also just to understand how the capacity lines up for some of those new products? Are these largely third-party produced or has been new production capacity able to produce those products? Just want to get a sense of how this will play out in 2021?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, with the surge in demand, both we and the retailers really wanted to focus on the core items. For us, it is a certain supply and the retailers still have the challenge of bringing product in and just the logistics of the whole increase in consumer shopping in their total store. So there's been much more of a focus on core. And the new items that we actually have launched early in the year got unprecedented trial. But the items that we had planned for the second-half really have been deferred into 2021 and add to that pipeline. I don't think our experience in that area is much different than what others set up. But we also had a big shelf initiative. We had a spice aisle reinvention program that we unveiled at Cagney and had a plan to get into thousands of stores. We have made that change in thousands of stores but nowhere near the magnitude that we expected. And so that's also going to be part of the program for next year. On the flavor solution side of the business, also, our customers have tended to focus on their core items as well. And so innovation in that area has also been curtailed. Quick service restaurants trying to manage demand and their drive-through and take takeaway model have focused more on core items and are really only now getting back into limited time offers and promotional offerings. And in our consumer food manufacturing customers are also just now ramping up their innovation programs. We have a lot of projects underway in that area that I think will be a benefit in that segment next year. But really, through the crisis the focus has been on core items both for us, our customers, both on flavor solutions and its retail.\nMike Smith: And some evidence of that, QSRs in APZ, in China and Australia are recovering faster. And more LTOs are coming out now, as we talked about this quarter. So we see that continue hopefully into next year.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you for that. And I just want to quick follow-up if I could on the gross margin, and I guess to implied gross margin for the fourth quarter. It does indicate some less growth or even a bit of a decline in the fourth quarter based on the performance year-to-date. Are there residual COVID costs we have to keep in mind? Is it the co-packers? And also you have some costs around the new capacity, are those sort of the factors that play into the fourth quarter gross margin performance?\nMike Smith: Oh, definitely, Chris. We\u2019ve talked at the last call, you're talking about $30 million split between the second and third quarter. Now we're saying 40 to 50, of which -- and we're considering the fourth quarter because of that unprecedented demand. So yes, those costs are continuing into the fourth quarter.\nLawrence Kurzius: I'd say that's the biggest factor.\nMike Smith: Yes, that really is. And we're saying too early, but we've had some very favorable segment mix over the last couple of quarters. We're going to see a little bit less of that in the fourth quarter. But the primary thing is the COVID cost, as Lawrence said.\nChris Growe: Okay, that sounds great. Thanks for your time this morning.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Pleased proceed with your questions.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. So I guess the first, it turns into a little bit of a question on the shifts on holiday sales into the fourth quarter in terms of the load in. But can you comment a little bit on retailer inventories and trade inventory in the U.S. right now, just given the surge in demand that we've seen? Just how do you think about that potentially being a tailwind into next year?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. I think you only have to walk into a store to know that the cover is there. We have in the first sorry -- in second quarter U.S. demand was, the scanner was up 55% and in the second quarter, it was at 28%. Our latest Nielsen still has it running up over 20 -- sorry, our latest IRI still has it running up over 20% that we have struggled to keep up with that demand. You've seen that we've reported lower numbers and a lot of that gap represents inventory reduction. So let's say that the shelf stocks are low, back room stocks are low to non-existent. There's a lot to rebuild. And as we go through the fourth quarter, we're ramping up capacity, but that's really meeting demand. The real rebuild of shelf stock, retailers safety stock, inventory in the whole, the normal level of inventory and the trade pipeline, that rebuild is going to happen next year, and it's going to take well into the year to get that back up.\nMike Smith: And that's what gives us further confidence on growth next year on the consumer side.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, now that's helpful. And then I guess my second question was more on the --\nLawrence Kurzius: And I don't think, we're not alone in that situation.\nAdam Samuelson: No, that's totally fair. My other questions was on the flavor solutions and especially thinking in the Americas with the volume mix that decline you reported. And maybe you can give a little bit more color by kind of your major categories branded food service, the flavors business the condiments coating, just how the different parts of your business are performing relative to that negative 5%? And where that's trending and some potential number?\nLawrence Kurzius: Quick service restaurants are generally doing great. So they're very much in a recovery mode, depending on the geography, in some cases they're well into growth again, and other geographies, they're not quite there. But their model was already very oriented towards consumption away from premise, drive through and so on. So they've had a fast recovery, and really are irresponsible for the big swing that we saw in our EMEA, our region in particular for example or second quarter were down 31%, third quarter we're actually up 1%. The flip side of that and the slowest recovering or your traditional restaurant and food service customers, many of those are still closed or operating under capacity restrictions. In our survey data, over half of consumers still say they do not intend to eat inside at a restaurant this year. So, there's quite a path, a challenging path for them to recover. And in fact, as we get into the fall weather with cooler weather, it's going to be hard for us to -- it's going to be -- it's hard to see how it has -- that's going to be another headwind for them as we get to that time period. And so those are the ones that are there going to be more challenged. And our consumer manufacturers are pretty much back to normal that they've pretty much gotten back on track, and varies by customer, but as a group, in aggregate they're back to a more normal path. And in the Americas, I think if you were trying to dig a little bit beyond that, I think branded food service is a higher percentage of our total flavor solutions in the Americas compared to the rest of the world. That's a little bigger impact there.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That's truly helpful color. I appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I just had a question around freight costs. We've been seeing a pretty sizable uptick. Both in the spot markets and just wondering if that's going to spill over into contract freight rates. Just can you give us a sense of either as percent of sales or COGS, what freight represents? And maybe just in history, a couple of years ago, when freight was moving up, kind of how you guys managed it through the business?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I mean, freight has spiked really recently, it's been up and down over the last 12 months. A couple years ago, there was a huge shortage of containers or trade and the whole industry was really hurt by that. And through our CCI program, we really manage those costs. Within the last quarter, I can't tell you specifically what programs we have, to be honest, but distribution is one of those SG&A things that has been up, primarily due to internal warehousing moves and things like that just shipping product, but freight is a relatively minor total component of our cost of goods sold.\nLawrence Kurzius: And definitely in the scheme of other products going on right now.\nMike Smith: I wouldn't think it's not a material impact in the quarter, but it does add a few a little bit of the headwinds. It's a good question.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe just as a cleanup, the tax rate that 20% you gave, I mean, on a longer-term basis, I know you guys tend to talk about mid-20s, but it's been running in that closer to 20%, just as the stock has performed well. Just kind of help us think about that on a longer-term basis?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, longer-term it\u2019s still -- I'd say that what we said earlier this year 24% to 25%. Obviously, with the election coming up, we have no idea what's going to happen next year. So stay tuned for that one. But underlying the way the rules are written out 24% to 25%. And then periodically, we have tax planning initiatives. And then, as you said, with the stock performing very well and you get a really nice stock option favorability. Now, that is all set up in the operating expense line, just partially so that does have a little bit of a headwind up there, but generally, it's good for the tax line.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Thank you, and good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey there, David.\nDavid Driscoll: I wanted to ask you one question on the fourth quarter, and then just one follow-up on your '21 commentary. On the fourth quarter, you appear to be implying within the full year guidance, a revenue slowdown versus the third quarter. And I just wanted to hear your description as to what are the qualitative factors here? Do you expect the second wave of the virus to be impacting? Is that implied within the guidance? Or do you really just kind of take where we are today on viral impact and just extend that forward? And then are there any other key assumptions that go into that fourth quarter? And then on 2021, I'm curious about whether or not you see this as your growth comments? Are these in your control? Is it this inventory situation that's just so significant in '21, that it underpins your confidence to make these growth comments? Because, of course, nobody knows about the vaccine, how many people will take it, what that will do to consumer behavior. But I'm thinking that what you're trying to tell us today, as it doesn't really matter. There's so many underlying positives inherent to your business that are in your control, that you can still say that there would be growth in '21 in that consumer segment. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think for Q4, I'll start, and then I'll let Mike take it and let me come back to 2021 in a minute. For flavor solutions, we're pretty much looking at the status quo versus where we are right now, because the QSRs have largely recovered. And we see just a hard path forward for the rest of the restaurant side of the business. Given the uncertainty around resurgence, I mean, look what's happening in Europe, right now, cold weather coming in. There's probably going to be some good news on a vaccine. But the fact is, that\u2019s probably not going to be widely available till sometime well into next year. So, there's a lot of uncertainty out there around that. For the consumer side, demand continues to be strong. We've had all these gains and penetration trial consumers seem to be having a good experience cooking at home. And cooking at home behavior has really held up in a way that frankly, we've underestimated all year long. I mean, it's been stronger than we thought and every time we look at it, it's holding up stronger and longer than we thought. So we're expecting some moderation next year, but we are also expecting quite a lot of it to stick. There are still a lot of uncertainties around 2021, which is why we don't give guidance this early. But we did see a growing disconnect between the expectations for growth of consumer that was going to be your so wide, we felt like we had to say something about it.\nMike Smith: Yes. And regarding the fourth quarter, I mean, we wanted to give some meaningful guidance, but also wanted to be prudent in a really uncertain environment. And there's variables to the high and the low end. We think the demand is there, obviously, as we see in the scanner data, but our ability to supply especially in the U.S. is really challenged. So we wanted to at least be proven from that perspective.\nDavid Driscoll: I appreciate the comments. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing comments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thank you everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor, differentiated with a broad and advantage portfolio. In the volatile environment in which we currently operate, this balanced portfolio drives consistency in our performance. We have a growing and profitable business, delivering flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in the industry and in the world, with new ideas, innovation and purpose. One of the most significant risks that any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We've all been experiencing that disruption this year and McCormick continued to be well prepared, and not only manage through it but emerge stronger. With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we're confident our strategies continue to position us drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please reach out to me. This now concludes this morning's conference call. Have a good day, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The last few months have been an extraordinary period, and the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve daily. I'm incredibly proud the way McCormick performed in this unprecedented operating environment. Starting on Slide 4, let me highlight a few points on the current condition that we're seeing and their potential impacts. First, in our consumer segments around the world, we are experiencing strong sustained consumer demand, which has real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. In China, which is viewed as a leading indicator since their COVID-19 recovery is ahead of the rest of the world, the demand for food at home continues to be very strong. We see the same in Europe, and, of course, in the Americas. The significant shift to consumers eating more at home is persisting long enough that it has become a habit. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by other research indicates a majority of consumers are cooking more from scratch, enjoying the cooking experience and adding flavor to their meal occasion. These new behaviors coupled with some consumer discomfort for dining out are driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home. We believe this will continue globally and thus further benefit our consumer segment. Turning to our flavor solutions segment, where we have a very diverse customer portfolio. We are seeing varying stages of recovery. Starting with the away from home portion of this segment, with our quick service restaurant customers or QSR, we are seeing strong signs of recovery. Their business models were already oriented to drive through or carry out, not dining in. In China QSR traffic has returned to near normal level, and the limited time offers and promotions are driving demand. In the rest of the APZ region as well as EMEA and Americas, the focus has been on core menu items. So moving into the fourth quarter, we see limited time offerings beginning to reserve. Across the rest of the food service, while it has shown signs of recovery since our second quarter, the pace is much slower and varies by channel and market. As we have previously mentioned, we expect the recovery in this area of the business to be more gradual and take time, likely years, as restaurants and other food service venues such as stadiums and cafeterias, continue to be largely closed or operating under capacity limitations. Consumers are reluctant to dine out, and the restaurant industry has experienced significant pain. From the food at home perspective, our flavor solutions growth varies by packaged food customer, but overall, we're returning to pre-COVID-19 level, as expected. New product opportunities, which had slowed during the crisis and have been more focused on expansion of the core, are beginning to gain increased momentum, and we're excited about their contribution to growth next year. In summary, for our total flavor solutions segment, business is gradually rebounding, though not yet the 2019 level. Moving to our global supply chain, coming into the crisis, there was more finished goods inventory in the system, both for us and our customers, which was depleted early in the crisis. The sustained, elevated level of demand coupled with our added employee safety measures, has challenged our manufacturing operations. Service has been stressed in some areas and inventory replenishment will take some time. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, that we've had to suspend or curtail production with some secondary products to meet demand for our top selling products. While the rest of the world is also experiencing elevated consumer demand, they've not experienced the same level of manufacturing pressure, given the capacity and capabilities we've built outside of the Americas in the past few years. In EMEA, where our supply chain is very well-positioned to meet demand, we've gained distribution as other manufacturers have faced challenges. For the Americas, as we said on our earnings call in June, we're expanding our workforce and increasing manufacturing capacity through optimized scheduling and investment, particularly around blending capacity, as well as scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturer. To be clear, this added capacity is still ramping up. This capacity just started to come online in August, and will continue to ramp up over the next few months. And it's targeted to be completely in place by the end of the calendar year. And by then, we will have added the equivalent of an additional plant for the U.S. manufacturing capacity. Of course, with this rapid scale up, there are extra costs and short-term inefficiency, but we're confident we're implementing efficient long-term solution. The investments we're making are not just to meet the higher demand for the balance of 2020, but to strengthen our supply chain resiliency longer-term, and to support the America's consumer growth, we anticipate continuing into next year, driven by both sustained demand as well as retailer inventory replenishment. We're making good progress. Our service levels continued to improve and we're confident in our capabilities and ability to meet demand, particularly during the holiday season. We're positioning ourselves for continued success. I want to thank our supply chain employees for their remarkable efforts, as well as our suppliers and customers for their partnership in this challenging environment. The positive fundamentals we have in place have enabled us to manage through this period of volatility. The investments we've made and the capabilities we've built, combined with our strong business models, prepared us to execute from a position of strength. As the crisis subsides, we will emerge an even better company, by driving our long-term strategy, responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength. Now, I'd like to focus on our third quarter performance, business update on our consumer and flavor solutions segments and our 2-for-1 stock split announcement. As seen on Slide 6, we have a broad and advantage global flavor portfolio, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced by our third quarter results. During the third quarter, the shift in consumer behavior to cooking even more at home or at home consumption, drove a substantial increase in our consumer segments demand, as well as increases with our packaged food company customers and our flavor solutions segment. On the other hand, we experienced the decline in demand from our restaurants and other food service customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio, which historically has represented approximately 20% of our total annual company's sales. The impact of this shift more at home consumption varied by region, due to the different levels of away-from-home consumption in each, as seen on Slide 6, as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offerings, but we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, underlying consumer demand continues to underpin our growth. Now let me cover the highlights of our third quarter, which were broadly in line with the trends we discussed in our earnings call in June. Starting with our topline, third quarter sales increased 8% from a year ago period. In constant currency sales grew 9%, mainly attributable to significantly higher volume and product mix in our consumer segment, with a partial offset from a low single digit decline in our flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income increased 5%, including 1% unfavorable impact from currency. These results were driven by higher sales, favorable mix primarily driven by the sales mix between segments. And CCI-led cost savings partially offset by higher costs, including those related to COVID-19. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.53, 5% higher than the year ago period of $1.46, driven primarily by our strong operating performance. With one quarter left in the year, we have resumed guidance and expect to deliver another year of strong profitable growth. Our results continued to be driven by the engagement of our employees and the successful execution of our strategy. And we're confident in our 2020 outlook, which will be covered in detail in a few moments. Now, let me spend a few minutes on our business segment update. Starting on Slide 8, with our consumer segment, sales rose 15% with minimal impact from currency, fueled by the change in consumer behavior. Research and trend data show that not only are consumers cooking more at home, they're enjoying it, both from a flavor and family experience, and have even accelerated their use of spices, seasonings and condiments, as the pandemic has progressed. Additionally, as at home consumption from restaurant carryout and delivery is increasing, many consumers are adding flavor what spices, sauces or condiments they have at home. We believe these trends will last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and drive continued growth. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 17% in the third quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 28%, which is substantial and reflects the strength of our category, as consumers cook more at home. Our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth attributable to a few factors. First, the service level pressures and product allocation from the supply chain challenges, I mentioned previously. Next, the timing of the holiday program we offer retailers. We generally offer the program during our third quarter to encourage early in store display and merchandising of holiday products. The impact of this program was included in our third quarter shipments in 2019. In 2020, though, with the elevated level of demand and focus on keeping core items on shelf, a portion of retailer purchases for this program has shifted to our fourth quarter. Notwithstanding this shift, we still expect another year of strong holiday execution. And lastly, increased level of pricing growth in the scanner data, due to curtailed third quarter promotions and channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores. Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio, consumption in all key categories grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter, with the majority of our categories continuing to outpace the total store and centers for growth rates. In fact, consumption in our portfolio during the third quarter, grew 2.5 times the center of store rate, which is an increase from the comparison in the second quarter. But we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our third quarter. We do expect continued and long lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the week ended September 13, shows McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption still growing over 20%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. We gained share at seven out of 11 categories during the third quarter, those which were less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. While there was noise in the third quarter share numbers for categories impacted by supply, such as spices and seasonings dry recipe mixes and mustard, on a year-to-date basis were relatively flat or gaining share in those categories too. New products launched earlier in the year such as Frank's RedHot thick sauces, Old Bay hot sauce and Stubb's reduced sugar barbecue sauce, have continued to get exceptional trial and contributed to the third quarter growth. The sell-in of our second-half new product launches however has been slowed due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. And these launches will now be further opportunities to fuel growth next year. The slow performance across household penetration and the rate of repeat buyers continued in the third quarter across our portfolio. Our household penetration rate increased 8% compared to last year, driving a significant amount of trial for millions of new households across multiple categories. Spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes and hot sauces has the biggest gain, but even smaller brands like Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen grew significantly, and their rate of repeat buyers increased 7% during the quarter, with double digit repeat rates in many categories. These metrics increasing significantly, both in our second quarter and third quarter indicates a high level of usage and speaks to the stickiness of our product. Consumers are coming into our brands, having a good experience and buying our products again. With our high level of effective brand marketing assessments, including planned increases in the fourth quarter, and our initiatives to deepen our digital connection with consumer, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity after trial and increase usage by existing consumer. We're continuing to design targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home, teaching consumers how to use our products and providing a flavor inspiration. And as the younger generation continues to fuel the demand for flavor, and everyone has accelerated their online presence, we're executing on creative ways to connect with them. For instance, one way we're connecting with consumers is by helping them discover new ways to enjoy time honored tradition. Take Tailgating for example, with football season now in full swing, we partnered with former New York Giants Quarterback, Eli Manning to create the largest virtual homegating experience, having the lucky fans interact with Eli to learn about his favorite Frank's RedHot flavor snacks, the recent event garnered over 750 million media impressions across digital media platform. Moving from the football season to the holiday season, our fourth quarter is an important one from a seasonal standpoint. Our consumer's holiday dinner may be more important than ever this year, and we're excited about helping make them memorable flavor experiences. In terms of brand marketing, we're launching a holiday version of our 'It's Gonna Be Great' campaign, which recognize that celebrations might be different this year, in addition to our normal holiday promotion activities. And from a supply chain standpoint, we're protecting our top selling holiday products. We have confidence, we're well-positioned for a successful holiday season. Our portfolio and the plans we have in place are even more relevant today than they were before the crisis, as we expect the increase in at home cooking to persist. We will continue to drive our category leadership and growth momentum through strong brand marketing, category management initiative and new product innovation. Now turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 23% with broad based growth across the region. Our largest markets drove double digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in our key categories. Importantly, we gained total EMEA region share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. The spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, driven by consumers cooking more at home and discovering they need our products for great tasting, healthy flavor solutions. Our brand marketing campaign highlighting our product superiority and culinary partnership, coupled with pivoting or digital messages based on real time consumer insights, with the topics most relevant to consumers and formats that resonate the most are driving spices and seasoning momentum. In the UK, our Schwartz brand new dry recipe mixes, such as One Pan meal seasonings offer a convenient and natural herb and spice blends for vegetarian options, are attracting younger consumers to the category and driving new distribution gains, as well as category growth. We achieved the leading UK market share position in dry recipe mixes at the beginning of the year, and we continue to gain significant market share in the third quarter. And with the momentum in baking continuing, combined with successful new product launches, we again had exceptional consumption of growth in our Vahine brand in France, outpacing the homemade desserts category and gaining share. Notably, Frank's RedHot turned up the heat during the third quarter, with over 40% consumption growth driven partly by a successful digital drilling campaign as well as new distribution. We're gaining millions of new households and driving repeat purchases. Our household penetration increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the third quarter compared to last year, with double digit growth percentages in both the UK and France spices and seasonings categories, as well as in the UK dry recipe mixes and France homemade desserts category. And our rate of repeat buyers in these markets and categories also grew by double digit. Our strong brand marketing and digital campaign, which we've increased in EMEA, provide us with confidence, we will continue growing with our new consumer, while welcoming to our brand as well as our existing value consumer. Moving forward in EMEA, we'll continue to capture the momentum we've gained and are excited with our growth trajectory, following challenging market conditions over the past few years. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 6%, driven by declines in branded food service products, which are included in our consumer segment in China. Excluding those impacts, sales for the region would have increased, reflecting the increase in consumer demand across the region related to more cooking at home. In China, our consumer to business growth was strong, driven by consumers' demand for convenient solutions, fueling our growth of recipe mixes, as well as world flavor and hot pot sauces. Continued momentum in condiments also contributed to growth. In other parts of the region, we have broad based growth, led by Australia's strong consumption and share growth in branded spices and seasonings, particularly in Gourmet Garden, with high double digit rates of new consumers and repeat buyers, and Frank's RedHot with over 50% growth during the pandemic. Finally, in all regions, consumers digital engagement has increased significantly, as we continue to experience accelerated e-commerce growth in all categories, whether it'd be pure play, click and collect or our own direct to consumer property. The pace of growth has slowed from the second quarter, which was heavily impacted by more extensive stay at home period. But we again drove triple digit growth in the third quarter, as well as increasing our market share in several markets. We expect the shift to online shopping behavior to continue, and we're well-positioned for it, through the investments we've made and continue to make in this channel. Our consumer growth plans based on our strategies have been in place since the beginning of the year, and we're yielding the results before the crisis. And we've been able to leverage our initiatives to capitalize on the opportunity to help our consumers during this time and strengthen our category leadership positions, which further bolsters our confidence that we will drive future growth. Turning to Slide 10 in our flavor solution segments, our sales performance improved substantially from our second quarter constant currency decline of 16%. Our third quarter constant currency sales were 1% lower than last year, attributable to lower demand from restaurants and other food service customers, and our Americas and EMEA region, driven by the decline in away from home consumption. Almost, fully offsetting this lower demand, with continued growth in sales for packaged food customers across all regions, as well as strong sales growth to quick service restaurants in China. In the Americas, our sales declined 3% in constant currency, driven by demand declines across both branded food service and restaurant customers. With the branded food service impact more significant, as our away from home customer base in the Americas is skewed more to that channel. We're continuing to work with our customers impacted by away from home consumption declines to manage through their recovery efforts. With our customer intimacy approach, we're collaborating to provide solutions, such as menu simplification and optimization, branded portion controlled packaging for dining-in and carryout, and condiment dispensing solutions for food service operations. We're building menu excitement with strong promoters leveraging the power of our brand, driving wins for both our customers and us. We're excited about new distribution gains as well as upcoming menu participation and limited time offers, as the recovery momentum continues. In EMEA, our sales growth 1% in constant currency, the significant rebound from a 31% decline in our second quarter. Our away from home customer base in this region is skewed more to QSR, and then the third quarter as they reopen with adapted operating model and resumed limited dine-in options, our demand from these customers rebounded, although it's still modestly below the third quarter of last year. The recovery with other food service customers also began in the third quarter, as COVID-19 restrictions eased, although as expected, slower and not to the same extent as QSR. Turning to our at home customer base, we had strong growth in our flavor sales of the packaged food company, similar to pre-COVID-19 levels, driven by the strength in their core iconic products, as well as the momentum from new products launched at the beginning of the year. We're advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in this evolving environment, which has driven continued wins with our EMEA flavor solutions customer. Whether it'd be quickly scaling up to meet aggressive recovery plans, collaborating on opportunities, or managing through demand volatility, we're responding with speed and agility, and further strengthening our customer relationships. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7%, driven by China and Australia's growth of QSR customers. During the third quarter QSRs at these countries were largely open, and we're seeing momentum gaining in the core business and limited time offer and our customers' promotional activities. Government imposed COVID-19 restrictions and reduced levels of limited time offers continued to curtail growth in parts of the region. For the balance of the year, we expect a reduced level of our customers' limited time offer and promotional activities versus last year to impact growth. We continue across all regions to be fully committed to helping our customers manage through the COVID-19 recovery phase, of which the duration is still uncertain. The slow and evolving recovery process is dependent on many factors, including restrictions being lifted, venues fully reopening, and possible resurgences. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period of volatility. We remain confident in the successful execution of our strategies driving long-term growth trajectory in flavor solutions. Now before turning it over to Mike and beginning on Slide 11, I'd like to mention stock split we announced this morning and provide a few summary comments, including our 2020 outlook. I'm pleased with our announcement this morning of a 2-for-1 stock split, reflecting our sustained positive performance and outlook for continued growth. It has been 18 years since the last split of stock, which was in 2002, when the pre-split share price was $52.33. We believe this will provide greater liquidity and be appreciated by individual investors and employees. And now in summary, as the foundation of our sales growth is the global demand for flavor, we're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, heritage brands and digital engagement. These long-term trends have not only remained intact during the crisis, they have accelerated. And our alignment with them positions us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our products and our customer products. We're driving sales growth balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins, and sustainably realize earnings growth. We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we are ensuring, we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth. We've delivered outstanding year-to-date results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model. Our strategies are effective and reinforcing our customers, they will continue to drive future growth. Our 2020 outlook, which Mike will discuss in detail in a few moments, reflects the strength of our year-to-date performance and momentum we're carrying into our fourth quarter and 2021. We are exceeding the objectives we had in place at the beginning of the year, delivering stronger sales and underlying operating performance, while importantly also ensuring the health and safety of our employees, investing in our supply chain resiliency to meet growth we expect in 2021, recognizing the exceptional performance of our people throughout the COVID-19 crisis and supporting our communities through relief efforts. Our growth expectation reflects our confidence in the sustainability of higher at home consumption trends. As we look to our fiscal 2021, we expect constant currency organic sales growth in both of our segments on top of the outstanding consumer segment growth this year. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success, and thank them for their efforts, engagements and for adapting to this new environment. It is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and 2020 outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. We've delivered outstanding year-to-date results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company. Our foundation is solid and our strategies are effective. Our 2020 outlook reflects another year of strong operating performance while doing what is right for our employees and communities, as well as making investments for the growth we expect in both segments next year. We're confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment and to continue delivering differentiated results and build long-term value. And now I'd like to turn to your questions. Hi, Andrew. Good morning. Thanks for hanging in there for a very long script. But there is other -- in addition to what Mike said, there are costs that we incurred for temporary plant closure, like extraordinary sanitation that we do not anticipate happening again next year. And just bringing on all of this capacity has been done very quickly. And as a result, it's been brought on somewhat inefficiently in the short-term, and we expect that efficiency rate to go up as we get into next year. Now on incentive comp, Mike mentioned the word about that. I certainly hope that it doesn't -- it's not a tailwind next year. But if it's not, it's because -- if it is at the tailwind, it's because of continued extraordinary performance. We have pay per performance philosophy. Our employees have really delivered this year, and so incentive comp, across the all levels of the organization is pretty much at the top of our program range. And so, it would take a really extraordinary performance to repeat that. So probably it's going to be a tailwind as well, but in any case, the underlying business results that we delivered this year, don't get paid for twice. Our plants pay for growth. So, Andrew. It's actually -- it's a mix. So some of the capacity we've gained has been by adding people and changing our shift patterns so that we have more of our facilities operating on a 24/7 or 25/7 schedule, not just on some lines, but some case on all lines. So that's one way we've added capacity. We have made some short, we've made some -- we've been able to make some investments in blending capacity that are internal. And then we have brought on quite a lot of third-party co-packing capacity that is an incremental cost that we would hope to absorb into our own facilities over the course of next year. No, Ken, that makes a lot of sense. And that is a great question, because I think you've written about this. And I think that the Analysts community as a group, the consensus that's out there right now under calls, but we think the growth potential is and that's why we have commented on 2021 at this early stage, when we normally would really be focused completely on 2020. Now, even before COVID-19 hit, consumers were cooking more at home, they were using more spices and seasonings and sauces to prepare fresher, healthier meals. They're moving to trusted inherited brands, we talked about this. The pandemic accelerated these trends, and other trends like e-commerce that already underpin our strategies, and that we were already capitalizing on. And consumers haven't been doing anything that is contrary to what they have been trending to do already, they're just doing more of it. The data that we've gotten that we talked about in our prepared remarks, shows that most consumers are cooking more, they're enjoying it, they intend to cook more. And our brands have gained penetration in millions of households with a high level of repeat that shows strong satisfaction with the experiences that they're having. And we're not testing it in the U.S., we're seeing this play out globally. We've continued to invest behind our brands, and driving through the entirety of the crisis. And we've got a robust pipeline of innovation that includes some backlog from this year, but launch in 2021 too. We've added a lot of resilience and capacity in the supply chain. And the market, frankly, has taken all of it. And we're still ramping up for more just to meet the existing demand for consumption. And as you noted, we have store shelves to restock, retailer inventory to replenish and a broad range of suspended SKUs to restart. So yes, we think that there's going to be some moderation, there are going to be a couple of periods and areas where there are tough comparisons. But we absolutely expect growth in our consumer segment next year for a very good reason. Hi, Alexia. Sure. Well, all that we've done, first of all, has been done in cooperation and collaboration with retailers. Pretty much through -- much of the third quarter and into fourth our promotional plans are actually in place. But what's different is that the product is on allocation in many cases. And so the amount that retailers can take on the promotion is limited, number one. And then number two, we had a shift in our timing of our holiday program, normally, just because of the scale of the holiday program, we actually start deliveries in August to get displays up already, just to manage the surge. And as part of managing overall demand, we pushed about half of that off into Q4. So there's a timing difference there. But, I think that for the most part, our promotional plans are back in place. Those comments are pretty specific to the U.S. and Canada. And the rest of the world, where we really haven't been constrained by supply promotional plans have gone forward as normal at this point. So it has been our goal to deleverage to 3 times of EBITDA by the end of 2020. It looks like we're certainly there, that's a positive. And our goals for -- our acquisition strategy is unchanged, which is the acquisition support our growth strategies. And so, we've been signaling for a while that that we didn't feel that we actually had to literally get to report a 3.0 before we'd be back in the market. And so, we would say that we're open for business and the acquisition department. Hi, Rob, are you there? That's like the cliche of our time right now. But, the investments that we've made in supply chain this year have really been extraordinary, because of the extraordinary circumstances. We've had an unprecedented increase in demand that has been sustained over time that we have really had to work and almost throw money at in order to meet. And it hasn't been done in the most efficient way. And I think that, as we've commented on the first question from Andrew, we would expect that some of those costs would come out. Well, sure. Over the last several years, we've been building our capacity and capabilities in Asia Pacific first and in Europe second, as an area of investment focus. And actually, we had just turned to the Americas. This year, we announced a big investment in highly automated logistics center earlier this year, pre-COVID. And so, our investment cycle has turned to the Americas, but... And virtually all of our plants in Asia have been either new or renovated in the last several years. And we've made a number of big investments in expansion and automation in EMEA and we're just turning to the Americas. But even beyond that, it's just the scale of the surge of demand. I mean, the U.S. business is so big that even the same percentage growth turns into a massive amount of volume. Good morning, Chris. Well, with the surge in demand, both we and the retailers really wanted to focus on the core items. For us, it is a certain supply and the retailers still have the challenge of bringing product in and just the logistics of the whole increase in consumer shopping in their total store. So there's been much more of a focus on core. And the new items that we actually have launched early in the year got unprecedented trial. But the items that we had planned for the second-half really have been deferred into 2021 and add to that pipeline. I don't think our experience in that area is much different than what others set up. But we also had a big shelf initiative. We had a spice aisle reinvention program that we unveiled at Cagney and had a plan to get into thousands of stores. We have made that change in thousands of stores but nowhere near the magnitude that we expected. And so that's also going to be part of the program for next year. On the flavor solution side of the business, also, our customers have tended to focus on their core items as well. And so innovation in that area has also been curtailed. Quick service restaurants trying to manage demand and their drive-through and take takeaway model have focused more on core items and are really only now getting back into limited time offers and promotional offerings. And in our consumer food manufacturing customers are also just now ramping up their innovation programs. We have a lot of projects underway in that area that I think will be a benefit in that segment next year. But really, through the crisis the focus has been on core items both for us, our customers, both on flavor solutions and its retail. I'd say that's the biggest factor. Good morning, Adam. Yes. I think you only have to walk into a store to know that the cover is there. We have in the first sorry -- in second quarter U.S. demand was, the scanner was up 55% and in the second quarter, it was at 28%. Our latest Nielsen still has it running up over 20 -- sorry, our latest IRI still has it running up over 20% that we have struggled to keep up with that demand. You've seen that we've reported lower numbers and a lot of that gap represents inventory reduction. So let's say that the shelf stocks are low, back room stocks are low to non-existent. There's a lot to rebuild. And as we go through the fourth quarter, we're ramping up capacity, but that's really meeting demand. The real rebuild of shelf stock, retailers safety stock, inventory in the whole, the normal level of inventory and the trade pipeline, that rebuild is going to happen next year, and it's going to take well into the year to get that back up. And I don't think, we're not alone in that situation. Quick service restaurants are generally doing great. So they're very much in a recovery mode, depending on the geography, in some cases they're well into growth again, and other geographies, they're not quite there. But their model was already very oriented towards consumption away from premise, drive through and so on. So they've had a fast recovery, and really are irresponsible for the big swing that we saw in our EMEA, our region in particular for example or second quarter were down 31%, third quarter we're actually up 1%. The flip side of that and the slowest recovering or your traditional restaurant and food service customers, many of those are still closed or operating under capacity restrictions. In our survey data, over half of consumers still say they do not intend to eat inside at a restaurant this year. So, there's quite a path, a challenging path for them to recover. And in fact, as we get into the fall weather with cooler weather, it's going to be hard for us to -- it's going to be -- it's hard to see how it has -- that's going to be another headwind for them as we get to that time period. And so those are the ones that are there going to be more challenged. And our consumer manufacturers are pretty much back to normal that they've pretty much gotten back on track, and varies by customer, but as a group, in aggregate they're back to a more normal path. And in the Americas, I think if you were trying to dig a little bit beyond that, I think branded food service is a higher percentage of our total flavor solutions in the Americas compared to the rest of the world. That's a little bigger impact there. And definitely in the scheme of other products going on right now. Yes, longer-term it's still -- I'd say that what we said earlier this year 24% to 25%. Obviously, with the election coming up, we have no idea what's going to happen next year. So stay tuned for that one. But underlying the way the rules are written out 24% to 25%. And then periodically, we have tax planning initiatives. And then, as you said, with the stock performing very well and you get a really nice stock option favorability. Now, that is all set up in the operating expense line, just partially so that does have a little bit of a headwind up there, but generally, it's good for the tax line. Hey there, David. I think for Q4, I'll start, and then I'll let Mike take it and let me come back to 2021 in a minute. For flavor solutions, we're pretty much looking at the status quo versus where we are right now, because the QSRs have largely recovered. And we see just a hard path forward for the rest of the restaurant side of the business. Given the uncertainty around resurgence, I mean, look what's happening in Europe, right now, cold weather coming in. There's probably going to be some good news on a vaccine. But the fact is, that's probably not going to be widely available till sometime well into next year. So, there's a lot of uncertainty out there around that. For the consumer side, demand continues to be strong. We've had all these gains and penetration trial consumers seem to be having a good experience cooking at home. And cooking at home behavior has really held up in a way that frankly, we've underestimated all year long. I mean, it's been stronger than we thought and every time we look at it, it's holding up stronger and longer than we thought. So we're expecting some moderation next year, but we are also expecting quite a lot of it to stick. There are still a lot of uncertainties around 2021, which is why we don't give guidance this early. But we did see a growing disconnect between the expectations for growth of consumer that was going to be your so wide, we felt like we had to say something about it. Great. Great. Thank you everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is a global leader in flavor, differentiated with a broad and advantage portfolio. In the volatile environment in which we currently operate, this balanced portfolio drives consistency in our performance. We have a growing and profitable business, delivering flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in the industry and in the world, with new ideas, innovation and purpose. One of the most significant risks that any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We've all been experiencing that disruption this year and McCormick continued to be well prepared, and not only manage through it but emerge stronger. With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we're confident our strategies continue to position us drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin now by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance, and then our financial outlook for the balance of the year. Starting on Slide 14, during the third quarter sales were at 9% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by substantially higher volume and mix in our consumer segment, partially offset by lower volume and mix in our flavor solution segment, pricing to partially offset costs inflation also contributed favorably to both segments. Consumer segment sales grew 15% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The shift to at home consumption and cooking more at home, as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery has driven substantial demand for consumer products, driving higher volume and mix in these regions. On Slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 17% in constant currency, versus the third quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by significant growth across our branded portfolio, including higher volume and product mix of McCormick spices and seasonings, as well as Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Gourmet Garden, Frank's RedHot, Zatarain's, Stubb's, Lawry's and El Guapo products. Additionally, the pricing actions taken prior to COVID-19 in the first quarter, to partially offset increased costs also contributed to the growth. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 23% from a year ago, with double digit volume and mix growth in all countries across the region. The most significant growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros brands in spices and seasonings, our Vahine homemade dessert products and our Schwartz dry recipe mixes. Consumer sales in Asia Pacific declined 6% in constant currency, driven by lower branded food service sales, as Lawrence mentioned. This decline was partially offset by increased consumer demand across the region, with growth led by China's recipe mixes, sauces and condiments, as well as Australia's brand new spices, seasonings and condiments. Turning to our flavor solutions segment on Slide 18, third quarter constant currency sales decreased 1%, driven by declines in away from home products in the portfolios of our Americas and EMEA region. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales declined 3% driven by a significant decline in sales to branded food service customers, in addition to lower sales to quick service restaurants, partially offsetting these declines were increase sales of packaged food companies and pricing to offset costs increases. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 1%, driven by pricing to cover costs increases, also partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix decline, driven by reduction in sales to branded food service customers, in addition to lower sales to quick service restaurant customers, partially offsetting these declines was sales growth with packaged food companies. In the Asia Pacific region, flavor solution sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to quick service restaurants in China and Australia, partially driven by our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. As shown on Slide 22, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges increased 5% in the third quarter versus the year ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income grew by 6% and was driven by substantial growth in the consumer segment, partially offset by a significant decline in the flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income growth in the consumer segment was 18%, increasing to $209 million, or in constant currency was 19%, driven primarily by higher sales. In the flavor solution segment, adjusted operating income declined 24% to $64 million, or 22% in constant currency, driven partially by lower sales, unfavorable product mix due to decline in branded food service sales, and an unfavorable impact to manufacturing costs resulting from the lower volume. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain costs, including those related to additional compensation for our operations employees, safety and sanitation measures and scaling up to meet increased demand, as well as higher incentive compensation, which was driven by our strong year-to-date sales and operating profit performance. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by CCI-led cost saving. Gross profit margin expanded 70 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by favorable product mix, resulting from the sale shift between segments and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating margin compression of 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year was driven by the net impact of the factors, I just mentioned, as well as higher distribution costs. Turning to income taxes on Slide 24, our third quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 19.3% as compared to 17.6% in the year ago period. Those years were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, principally stock option exercises. Income from unconsolidated operations up $10 million in the third quarter was comparable to the year ago period. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 26, third quarter of 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.53, that's compared to $1.46 for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by our higher adjusted operating income with lower interest expense, offsetting the impact of a higher adjusted income tax rate. This increase also includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On Slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow in the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $627 million for the third quarter of 2020, a 27% increase compared to $495 million for the third quarter of 2019, and was driven by higher net income. We finished the third quarter with a cash conversion cycle at 36 days, down seven days versus our 2019 fiscal year end. We returned $247 million of cash to shareholders through dividends, and used $146 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, we were very happy that during the third quarter, we fully paid off the terms notes related to the acquisition of the Frank's and French's brands, and ended the third quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.1 times. We continue to project another year of strong cash flow. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, including through acquisitions, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Let's now move to our 2020 financial outlook. As a reminder, we withdrew our 2020 guidance during our first quarter earnings call in late March. The operating environment over the past six months has continued to evolve, and while there still remains much uncertainty and many variables which can drive a range of possible outcomes, we recognize our year-to-date performance has been strong and we are currently in the last quarter of our fiscal year. As such, we are resuming our 2020 guidance at this time based on the expectations Lawrence shared earlier this morning. Most notably, that the shift in consumer demand in at home consumption versus away from home will continue for the balance of the year, and even beyond. We believe this shift will continue to favorably impact the consumer segment in our fourth quarter. While the away from home part of this flavor solutions portfolio has begun to recover, it will continue to be unfavorably impacted. We expect the impact of both segments will not be to the same extent that we have realized in the past six months. Starting with the topline, we expect to grow sales at the upper end of a 4% to 5% range, which in constant currency is a range of 5% to 6%. This increase is expected to be entirely organic and reflects growth driven by new products, expanded distribution, fair marketing and pricing, which in conjunction with cost savings, is expected to offset anticipated mid-single digit inflationary pressures. It includes the net impact of the shift in demand due to COVID-19 and the consumers sustained preference for cooking at home. Our 2020 gross profit margin is expected to be 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2019, in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix, partially offset by COVID-19-related costs. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects the expected strength of our constant currency sales performance and underlying profit realization, partially offset by higher expenses related to COVID-19 and incentive compensation. We're projected to grow adjusted operating income by 4% to 5%, or 5% to 6% in constant currency. This includes our cost savings targets of approximately $105 million and an expected mid-single digit increase of brand marketing investments. We are estimating our COVID-19 costs, which include expenses related to additional compensation for our frontline operations employees, safety and sanitation measures and scaling up to meet increased demand, as well as donations to relief organizations will be approximately $40 million to $50 million for fiscal year 2020, with the majority of this cost impacted gross profit. Our estimated increase and incentive compensation is driven by our projected strong fiscal year sales and operating profit performance, and is consistent with our commitment to a pay for performance philosophy. Our 2020 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 20%. Based on our year-to-date performance, including the impact of favorable discrete items and the estimated mix of earnings by geography. This outlook compares to our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate of 19.5%. Our income from unconsolidated operations is also expected to be impacted by unfavorable currency rates, and as a result, we are projecting a mid-single digit decline. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2020 is $5.64 to $5.72. This compares to $5.35 of adjusted earnings per share in 2019, and represents a 5% to 7% increase, which in constant currency is a 6% to 8% increase. In summary, we are projecting another strong year of underlying operating performance, while doing is right, by first protecting our employees and recognizing their contributions, second, by supporting our communities through relief efforts, and finally, by making supply chain and brand marketing investments to meet our expected growth into fiscal 2021. And while we are not providing guidance for next year, I want to note that we do expect constant currency organic sales growth in both our segments in 2021, as Lawrence mentioned earlier. Additionally, I want to provide you a brief update on our ERP replacement program. We indicated in March that we will rephasing the timing of this program to focus on the challenging environment during the pandemic. We have remained excited and committed to our global transformation initiative. While the environment is still challenging, we have continued to work on this program. The delay provides us an opportunity to do some replanning, and as SAP has improved their product, our ramp up will be on a new version with a broader suite of applications, allowing us to save an upgrade cycle as well. We have not completed our planning yet, but we do not anticipate any major go lives in 2021. We will provide further updates on our ERP program on our earnings call in January. Finally, I would also like to mention that yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split with one share of common stock, with common stock non-voting to be issued for each like outstanding share. The additional shares will be distributed on November 30, and trading is expected to begin on a split adjusted basis on December 1. The stock split reflects the confidence we have in our future, and we believe it will provide greater liquidity and allow the stock to be more accessible to a broad range of investors. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some closing remarks before we move to your questions. Hey, Andrew, it's Mike. I'll answer this, and if Lawrence has any comments, he can chime in. You referred to the COVID costs. Obviously, we talked about -- this year about $40 million to $50 million incremental costs in 2020. We expect some of those to continue, however, some of those we don't expect to continue. Some of the things like we're scaling up production, we're onboarding people, we've incremental co-packers in place now. We expect that to not impact us into next year. However, some of the things we've done like PPE and other coverage for our employees, we do expect to continue. So it's a mix of that. However, we would be really -- a lot depends on the environment and continued resurgence. So, our January guidance will give you a lot more detail on that obviously. And that's primarily with a strategic partner that we already did co-packing with also. So we're not creating a quality risk out there at all. Yes. I mean, we're continuing -- even though we talked earlier about delaying the ERP, we're still incurring costs this year, we're going to spend in 2020 around the same level as we did in 2019. So you can expect that we replan this will have cost in next year. We're not prepared at this point to talk about the level of cost, but we just wanted to highlight the fact that, go lives, which are -- bring with them major costs aren't going to really happen until 2022. And we'll have more -- obviously the January guidance will sharpen the pencils for that. I think also to highlight the fact that we're upping our spend of brand marketing in the fourth quarter. We're going to have mid -- we've guided the mid-single digits for the year, which would imply 12% to 18% increase in the fourth quarter, because that advertising will drive growth in the first and second quarter. So we're really investing behind the brand at this opportunity. And I don't even need to talk about flavor solutions since everybody could see. Good morning. Hey, that's a great question, Rob. And I'll start it. No, that's a great point. And as we went into this year, obviously when we had planned a $60 million-ish investment in ERP, that was going to be dilutive to our margin. However, we need to become a bigger company, increase our scale. ERP program drives efficiencies across the organization and really allows us to grow faster and make acquisitions faster. It's hard to pin it down to one year investment and then you get back right away. But over a three or four year period where we look at our constant currency sales growth and our margins, and we see that really as our long-term guidance. One years, you're going to have some short-term ups and downs on it. And there are stake levers we can pull to from an advertising perspective, spending more or less. CCI is a tool we've used in the past to lean into, when we've had investments to make. So I think in January you'll see a better picture for next year. And you think about earlier this year, people have already forgotten the first quarter. China was such a shock to us and everybody, and the consumers there didn't get a chance to really buy. So that was a large first quarter impact for us, which really hurt our margins. Going even in the flavor solutions business, we talked about continuing to mix up there with portfolio management, this year has been a little tough because, food service, Frank food service, which is high margin, has been hurt by this COVID situation, whereas QSRs are recovering that has first and mixed perspective. But we see that over time recovering also. It's not as we've ignored Americas. We've had investments along the way, but it's the same region for us right. And some evidence of that, QSRs in APZ, in China and Australia are recovering faster. And more LTOs are coming out now, as we talked about this quarter. So we see that continue hopefully into next year. Oh, definitely, Chris. We've talked at the last call, you're talking about $30 million split between the second and third quarter. Now we're saying 40 to 50, of which -- and we're considering the fourth quarter because of that unprecedented demand. So yes, those costs are continuing into the fourth quarter. Yes, that really is. And we're saying too early, but we've had some very favorable segment mix over the last couple of quarters. We're going to see a little bit less of that in the fourth quarter. But the primary thing is the COVID cost, as Lawrence said. And that's what gives us further confidence on growth next year on the consumer side. Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I mean, freight has spiked really recently, it's been up and down over the last 12 months. A couple years ago, there was a huge shortage of containers or trade and the whole industry was really hurt by that. And through our CCI program, we really manage those costs. Within the last quarter, I can't tell you specifically what programs we have, to be honest, but distribution is one of those SG&A things that has been up, primarily due to internal warehousing moves and things like that just shipping product, but freight is a relatively minor total component of our cost of goods sold. I wouldn't think it's not a material impact in the quarter, but it does add a few a little bit of the headwinds. It's a good question. Yes. And regarding the fourth quarter, I mean, we wanted to give some meaningful guidance, but also wanted to be prudent in a really uncertain environment. And there's variables to the high and the low end. We think the demand is there, obviously, as we see in the scanner data, but our ability to supply especially in the U.S. is really challenged. So we wanted to at least be proven from that perspective."

As seen on slide two, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors including the impacts of COVID-19 that could affect our financial results. It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The last few months have been an extraordinary period and the global recovery from COVID-19 continues to evolve daily. McCormick's commitment to maintaining critical food supply across all of our markets and supporting our communities has been constant during these turbulent times. Across the globe, we've committed financial resources to many organizations to support frontline health care workers, emergency responders, and the restaurant and hospitality industries, including donating to food banks and causes nearly 20 countries to ensure reliable access to food to those most vulnerable during this ongoing pandemic. We're working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have three priorities, which we've spoken about since the first days of the crisis as we work through this period. The first is to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the quality and integrity of our product. The second is to keep our brand and our customers' brands in supply and maintain the financial strength of our business. And the third is to make sure we emerge stronger from this crisis. As a company, we've seen all phases of the pandemic, from lockdown starting in January to various stages of recovery today. Our businesses in China are fairly far along in recovery with the exception of the Hubei province, one of our most highly developed regions in China, which is in the early stages of recovery as it was under an extended lockdown through April 8. Other businesses in Asia-Pacific as well as the EMEA are about two or three months behind China with variations by market, with some markets beginning early recovery late in the second quarter. In the Americas, which is also about two to three months behind China, restrictions began to loosen late in the second quarter, with recovery currently in its early stages. Turning to slide five. Let me highlight a few points on the current conditions we're seeing and our potential impact. Our consumer segment was positively impacted early in the quarter by some initial pantry stocking in the Americas and the EMEA region and pantry replenishment in China. While these behaviors elevated consumption for a period, as the quarter progressed, strong consumption continued steadily across all regions. Our consumer survey data shows that strength was real incremental consumption driven by increased cooking at home. We believe the shift in consumer consumption to eating at home will continue, partially driven by the status of the restaurant and food service industry, as well as consumer confidence with eating out and significantly influenced by an increased preference for cooking at home, which we believe will be longer lasting. We don't expect the same level of consumption to continue for the balance of the year that we experienced throughout the quarter, or we do expect consumption to remain at some elevated level driven by the shift in consumer preference. Additionally, we would expect to benefit from consumers eating at home if we were to enter a recessionary period consistent with our historical sales performance during past recessions. As our second half of the year begins, we continue to see elevated demand from our customers and through scanner data. Turning to our flavor solutions segment, let's start with our sales to packaged food companies, which historically represents roughly half of our flavor solutions portfolio. Early in the quarter, we experienced surges in demand, which tapered off throughout the quarter and performance varied by customer. We expect overall demand consistent with pre-COVID levels in our second half. For our restaurant and other food service customers, we began the quarter with reduced demand as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets eliminated dine-in services and limited restaurants to carry out delivery only. As we expected, this had a significant negative impact on our second quarter performance, particularly in the EMEA region as most restaurants completely closed. Late in the quarter, we began to see and believe we will continue to see a gradual recovery, which again will vary by market. Quick service restaurants, or QSRs, are recovering quicker, with the rest of the food service building more slowly. In China, QSRs are largely open and traffic has returned to fairly normal levels. Certain markets in the Americas and EMEA, indoor dine-in service are beginning to open on a limited basis and outdoor dining options have reopened. In EMEA, QSRs' delivery and drive-thru options began to resume in June, and they are seeing initial surges in demand. As we begin our third quarter, we are seeing our away-from-home demand beginning to come back. Our restaurant and other food service customers have experienced significant disruption, are adapting their operating model, refining their menu offerings, focusing on core items and exploring alternative ways to drive demand to offset dine-in decline. And we're collaborating with them on their recovery efforts. Our global supply chain has been critical to our success during this period of volatility. It is an area of strength for us, and one of the reasons we will come through this crisis strong. Our global sourcing organization has been a real differentiator, quickly executing contingency plans of placing critical materials where needed since our early involvement in China and ahead of any demand surge. While we, of course, have experienced some raw material constraints, these have had minimal impact on our ability to meet demand. Coming into the crisis, there was more finished good inventory in the system, both for us and our retailers, than there is today. The sustained level of consumer demand, coupled with our added safety and flexibility measures, has put pressure on our manufacturing operations and services stressed in some areas. As we enter our typically largest quarters, we're expanding our workforce and increasing manufacturing capacity to optimize scheduling, investments and partnerships. By the end of the year, we will have added the equivalent of an additional plant of US manufacturing capacity. We have already passed the low points in our ability to meet demand and our service levels are improving weekly. We're positioning ourselves for continued success and confident of our capabilities and our ability to meet demand. I want to thank our supply chain employees for their remarkable effort, as well as our suppliers and customers for their partnership in this challenging operating environment. Given this evolving operating environment, while we recognize we've had strong performance thus far in 2020, we are not providing guidance due to the high level of uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 crisis for the balance of year, including the variation in consumer comfort with respect to eating away from home versus at home and its impact on consumption level, the pacing of restaurant and food service locations fully reopening in our various geographic markets, and finally, the possible impact of any resurgences of the COVID-19 virus. We're focused on execution and remain confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment, as we have thus far, and continue on our growth trajectory. I'm incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in these unprecedented times. And as the crisis subsides, we will come out a better company for driving our long-term strategies, responding to changing consumer behavior, and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength. Now, I'd like to focus on our second quarter performance, business update on consumer, flavor solutions segments. We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio as seen on slide seven, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced by our second quarter results. During the second quarter, the shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at home consumption drove a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand, as well as increases for the packaged food company customers and our flavor solutions segment. On the other hand, we've seen a sharp decline in demand from a restaurant and other food service customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio, which historically has represented approximately 20% of our total annual company sales. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption varied by region due to different levels of away-from-home consumption and age. While we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, underlying consumer demand continues to underpin our growth. We're confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio will continue to differentiate McCormick and position us for continued growth. In addition to our advantaged portfolio, several other key factors, as seen on slide eight, were underlying McCormick's strength in the second quarter. First and foremost, consumers were finding comfort in the brands they trust, and we are here today for them as we have been for over 130 years. We've pivoted our messaging as needed, and are connecting with our consumers to guide them and provide inspiration for their flavorful cooking. We've responded to the significant disruption and capitalizing on our capabilities across the organization, particularly our supply chain, sales force and marketing team, as well as through our collaboration partnerships, both internally and externally. We're all standing together to manage through this crisis. Let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results which speak to the value of our product and to our capabilities as a company. Our exceptional second quarter performance was driven by the substantial increase in demand for our consumer products as consumer saw great tasting experiences with rich, authentic flavor, healthy high quality ingredients, and cooking more at home. Our ability to meet the increased consumer demand and navigate through sharp declines in the away-from-home products in our portfolio highlights our agility in responding to the disruptions we've all experienced, while, importantly, keeping our employees safe. Our results reflect our strong foundation and the effectiveness of our strategies, as well as the engagement of our employees around the world. Together, we delivered considerable sales, operating income, earnings per share growth, each metric grew double digits in constant currency. Starting with the top line, second quarter sales increased 8% from the year-ago period, and constant currency sales grew 10%, mainly attributable to the higher volume of product mix in our consumer segment, partially offset by the sharp volume declines in our flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, including a 2% unfavorable impact from currency and adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points. These results were driven by higher sales, favorable mix and savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.47, 27% higher than the year-ago period of $1.16, driven primarily by our strong operating performance. Our second quarter results were exceptional, driven by our successful execution and enabled by the positive fundamentals we have in place to manage through this period of volatility. The investments we've made and the capabilities we've built, combined with our strong business model, prepare us to execute from a position of strength. We have confidence in our strategies, our underlying foundation is solid as we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. Now let me spend a few minutes on our business updates. Starting on slide 10 with our consumer segment. Sales rose 26%, including a 2% unfavorable impact from currency. Constant currency sales grew 28%, significantly fueled by the COVID-19 crisis. Our pricing actions and growth plans were in place, yielding results before the crisis, and those plans have remained in place, although some adjusted and even strengthened to execute in this challenging time that help our consumers and customers navigate through it as well. In the Americas, our IRI data indicates our total McCormick US branded portfolio grew 55% during the second quarter, which is substantial and reflects the strength of our categories as consumers cooked more at home. And in the data just released this past Tuesday, for the week ended June 13, scanner sales for total US McCormick branded portfolio continued to be strong, growing 32%. While we expect consumption will not continue at this highly elevated level of our second quarter, you can see it as still strong, and we expect continued growth from an increase in consumer cooking at home to last for a period of time. Turning to our shipments, in constant currency, the Americas sales grew 36% during the second quarter. The difference between the US IRI scanner sales growth and our shipments can be attributed to a few factors. First, depletion of inventory to meet the incredible surge in consumer demand. Next, an increased level of pricing growth in the scanner data due to cancelled promotions and channel shift. And lastly, while we had significant growth in Canada, Latin America and private label sales, they paced behind the growth rate of US branded sales. Focusing on the US branded portfolio, not only did our consumption grow, but we also gained share in nine out of 11 categories, including spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes, hot sauce and mustard. The growth rates in the majority of our categories are outpacing the total store center-of-store growth rate. In fact, consumption in our portfolio during the second quarter grew twice the center of store rate. Our categories are not what consumers think about when stocking up. They are the categories consumers used to flavor the meals they cook at home. New and renovated products also contributed to our second quarter sales growth, such as our dry recipe mixes updated for instant pot preparation, offering an even more convenient solution, and our Frank's RedHot thick sauces, introducing Frank's flavor to dipping and topping occasions. Later this year, we'll expand Frank's even further with the launch of frozen appetizers, chicken bites and dips. And earlier this month, we relaunched our Old Bay hot sauce with expanded distribution just in time to heat up the summer. With the retailer focus on keeping core items on retail shelves, there has been some slowdown in the sell-in of our new product launches, but we're excited about the pipeline we will carry into next year. And those that we have launched have gotten exceptional good trial. We're growing our household penetration across our portfolio, with a 16% increase compared to last year, which is millions of new households gained and a significant amount of trials from those households was across multiple categories. Spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes and hot sauce had the biggest gain. But even smaller brands like Simply Asia grew significantly. And our rate of repeat buyers increased 11% during the quarter, which is notable given that our repeat rate was already very robust. During the quarter, we launched our new US McCormick brand advertising campaign \u2013 \"It's Going to be Great\" \u2013 which is the strongest scoring campaign in our consumer testing history. This TV and digital campaign is focused on consumer education of what to make, how to prepare and build confidence in the kitchen, which is all even more relevant now as consumers cook more at home. We continued to design targeted media messaging to focus on cooking at home and drive-thru. We're planning to increase our brand marketing investment in the second half of this year. The speed and agility we gained with our marketing excellence organization has proved invaluable as we turn insight into action and can pivot to adjust our messaging even more efficiently and effectively to capture the moment. The team has rapidly generated insights, creating and deploying new videos and tutorials that range from easy weeknight meals using pantry staples, bread making and cocktails for virtual happy hour. This is critical to execute our plan to create deeper connections with our consumers by bridging their physical and digital experience, which is even more important today with consumers accelerating their online presence. Our consumers are looking for help and inspiration in the kitchen and we're here for them, with one of the ways being our Flavor Maker app. Organic search visits to our McCormick.com site were up over 200% in the second quarter versus last year, with consumers 18 to 34 years old driving the largest increase, searching for recipes and to learn to cook. The younger generation continues to fuel the demand for flavor, and we're executing some creative ways to connect with them. We're personalizing our interactions with consumers. As we have been all home together, our McCormick chefs invited consumers into their home kitchen for a new Cook With Us Instagram series, enabling one to one connection and putting a true face to McCormick. Consumers are tagging McCormick with posts of their user-generated content and we're engaging with them, including incorporating some of their content into our own ad, and providing users a chance to win a personal virtual cooking class with one of our chefs. And finally, it is essential to McCormick to support our communities, particularly at times of uncertainty. Our marketing and excellence organization has had tremendous success with their creativity and applied it recently to not only connect with consumers, but to make a difference in their lives. Today, we partnered with actress Drew Barrymore, and together hosted a virtual Taco Tuesday night called #TacosTogether in the hopes of encouraging others to augment McCormick's $1 million donation and support the No Kid Hungry campaign, working to ensure children have reliable access to food during this ongoing pandemic. #TacosTogether garnered over 800 million impressions across the media landscape, exceeding our own expectations of our reach, and importantly, creating visibility to this vital cause. Overall, we're confident all the initiatives we have underway will continue our growth trajectory, both with our valued existing consumers and those we're welcoming to our brand. Now, turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 26%, with broad-based growth across the region and market share gains in a majority of our categories in our significant markets. Growth in our Vahin\u00e9 brand in France was excellent, led by vanilla and baking product. Urban spice consumption was strong in all markets, driven by consumers cooking more at home to discovering they need our product for great tasting, healthy flavor solution. The UK dry mix recipe mix category is attracting new shoppers, and purchase frequency is increasing as consumers seek convenient solutions. And our new products are driving the category growth, with the Schwartz brand continuing to gain share and retaining the leading positions we achieved last quarter. Our new product plans remain on track for the year across our EMEA portfolio, and we continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that elevated consumer demand will be met, even obtaining incremental placement for our branded portfolio with some retailers as other manufacturers face supply challenges. Our strong brand marketing campaigns and digital connections with the consumer contributed to our second quarter growth and provided us with confidence for future growth early in the quarter, which quickly shifted to increased digital advertising, search and social investments across key brands and markets using data-driven, real-time insights. For example, we created a social listening dashboard to understand the changing needs and topics most relevant to our consumers during the COVID-19 crisis. With baking being the highest trending topic during the crisis, we partnered with culinary websites to capitalize on over 600 pieces of user-generated baking at home social content to increase our interaction with consumers. [indiscernible] even further relevance, we created cooking at home website sections with health and wellness landing pages, including healthy recipes blogger content, combined with content from our BuzzFeed partnership highlighting recipes and our product. For example, the 13 herbs and spices everyone should have in their cover. Our execution of these baking and health campaigns drove over 20 million impressions each during the quarter. Moving forward, we'll continue to capture the momentum we've gained and our relevance with EMEA consumers through activation of similar programs, marketing campaigns, highlighting product superiority, culinary partnerships and our new product launches. In the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 13%, driven by our China business in the Hubei province where our Wuhan operation is located, which had an extended lockdown into early April. The Wuhan disruption negatively impacted the APZ consumer growth by 26 percentage points. Declines in branded food service products, which are included in our consumer segment in China, outside of Wuhan also contributed to the sales decrease. Excluding these impacts, sales for the region would have increased, reflecting the increase in consumer demand across the region related to the increase in cooking at home. In China, the consumer business outside of Hubei province is strong, with some products in our condiment portfolio doubling or tripling their sales for the second quarter of last year. Convenient solutions are being sought by consumers, driving growth of our recipe mixes, World Flavor hot pot sauces, as well as herbs and spices. And we're leveraging our new product successes on our direct-to-consumer platform and accelerating our new product launches, such as launching our squeezable healthy oil salad dressings, retailed during our third quarter. In other parts of the region which are lagging China from a recovery phase, we have broad-based growth and are gaining share in many categories. Across the entire region, we're also leading the consumer online and have pivoted our marketing plans for value and scratch cooking. Whether it be through our Frank's RedHot Tick Tock Fitness Challenge in China, our chefs providing inspiration and instruction on social media across the region, or through our Keep Calm and Curry On campaign in Australia, we're helping our consumers in augmenting the growth potential of the shift to cooking at home. In all regions, consumers' digital engagement has increased significantly during stay at home period, and we've seen an acceleration of our e-commerce growth in all categories, with second quarter triple-digit growth, whether it be pure play, click and collect or our own direct-to-consumer property in all of our major markets. We expect to shift to online shopping behavior to continue and we're well positioned for it through the investments we've made and continue to make in this channel. Our consumer portfolio and the plans we have in place are even more relevant today than they were before the crisis if we expect the increase in at home cooking to continue, which further bolsters our confidence that we will drive future growth. Turning to slide 12, in our flavor solutions segment, constant currency sales for the second quarter were lower by 16%, driven by the sharp declines in demand from restaurants and other food service customers, as away-from-home dining was significantly curtailed due to the COVID-19 restrictions, with a partial offset from continued growth in sales to our packaged food customers. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 impact, our underlying foundation is solid, and we've delivered strong sales growth margin expansion over the last few years, most recently 5% sales growth in the first quarter of this year and believe we would have continued our positive momentum. In the Americas, our sales declined 13% in constant currency. While we experienced demand declines across both branded food service and restaurant customers, branded food service had a more significant impact as our away-from-home customer base in the Americas does skew more to that channel and our quick service restaurant customers retain takeaway and delivery options, although with limited menus. In flavor solutions, we're differentiated by our customer engagement. And while our plans always included strengthening our intimacy this year, they were accelerated with some pivot by the COVID-19 crisis. Through our culinary and marketing support, we've been helping our customers adapt to the changing environment and eventually the new normal. From a culinary standpoint, we've developed virtual tools and are collaborating with our customers to provide solutions, such as modifying menus for carry-out, reinventing menu offerings with limited inventory, and optimizing recipes for COVID-19 safety protocols. And from a marketing perspective, we're leveraging the power of our brands, like Frank's RedHot and OLD BAY with strong promotional programs to help build menu excitement. Lastly, as many places will be moving away from tabletop condiments, we're pivoting to portion control packaging for dining and carryout. We're also exploring other options to expand our portion control offering further. In EMEA, where we had expected the most significant rate of decline from the COVID-19 measures, our sales were 31%, lower at constant currency than last year. Our away-from-home customer base in this region skewed more to QSR. And in late March, most of those customers completely closed the restaurant, not even drive-thru or carryout remained open. As I mentioned earlier, many of the QSRs adapted their model to reopen in June, offering limited menus for delivery and drive-thru, while dine-in remained close. They've established aggressive recovery plans, and we're demonstrating our speed and agility, scaling our operations back up and meeting customer demand on an accelerated timetable. In the Asia-Pacific region, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, closures and the curfews across the region outside of China, our constant currency sales declined 6%. China QSRs are largely open, and we're seeing momentum gain, with one QSR even launching a limited time offer which added to our sales this quarter. Across the rest of the region, government COVID-19 measures varied, as well as customers' ability to adapt. Where QSRs remained open in some capacity, the focus was on core items. For the balance of the year, we expect a reduced level from last year for our customers' limited time offers, which are an important growth driver in this region. Moving forward, we'll continue to work with all our customers to manage through the recovery phase as COVID-19 measures are lessened as strong and differentiated partnerships we built with our customers enabled our robust collaboration to navigate through the second quarter, we will continue to do so. We expect there will be a gradual recovery. As I mentioned earlier, the QSRs will recover more rapidly, with the rest of food service building more slowly. Based on this, combined with our different mix of quick service restaurants and other food service customers between the regions, we believe the pace of recovery of the away-from-home part of our business will vary from market to market. We're fully committed to helping all of our customers resume their operations, and expect the demand to return as the crisis passes, similar to what we're seeing in China's recovery. The duration of this current period is uncertain. The slow and evolving recovery process is dependent on many factors, including restrictions being lifted, venues fully reopening, and possible resurgences. We have positive fundamentals in place to manage through this period of volatility. And with our confidence in the successful execution of our strategies, we'll continue on our long-term growth trajectory in flavor solution. Now, I'd like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 13 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the global and growing consumer demand for healthy, flavorful cooking, as well as transparency around the source and quality of ingredients and the desire to buy heritage brands. This resonates even more today than ever before. Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category and we inspire flavor exploration across all markets through all channels that are aligned with consumers' demand for great taste, convenience, healthy options, digital engagement. Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach and our execution of effective strategies position us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our product and through our customers' product to drive sales growth. These long-term behaviors have not only remained intact during the crisis, but have been accelerated to even greater importance. No matter what, where or when people are eating and drinking, it is likely flavored by McCormick, and we are proud our McCormick brands are trusted by consumers and customers worldwide. We are continuing to drive sales growth, balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margin, and sustainably realize earnings growth. We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we're ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth. Our experienced leaders and employees are executing on our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders, while reacting to changes accordingly. We delivered exceptional second quarter results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model. Our strategies are effective and reinforcing our confidence that they will continue to drive future growth. While we know the balance of the year will be impacted by an uncertain environment and ongoing challenges, we're confident in the strength of our underlying foundation and performance. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success, and thank them for their efforts, engagement and for adapting to this new environment. Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Smith: Thanks, Lawrence. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin now by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance, and then discuss some of our expectations for the balance of the year. Starting on slide 15, during the second quarter, sales rose 10% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by substantially higher volume and mix in our consumer segment, offset by significant declines in our flavor solutions segment. The consumer segment sales grew 28% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMBA region. The shift to at home consumption and cooking more at home has driven substantial demand for our consumer products. Higher volume and mix primarily drove the increase, with pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributing. On slide 16, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 36% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019. The increase was broad based, with significant growth across the McCormick branded portfolio, both in major channels and e-commerce as well as in private label products. Additionally, the pricing actions we took late in the first quarter to offset increased costs also contributed to the growth. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 26% from a year ago, with higher volume and mix in all countries across the region. The most significant growth drivers were our Vahin\u00e9 homemade dessert products in France, our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings and our Schwartz dry recipe mixes. Consumer sales in Asia-Pacific declined 13% in constant currency, driven by the extended disruption in Wuhan, which as Lawrence mentioned drove a decrease of 26 percentage points to the region's consumer sales. This decline was partially offset by increased consumer demand across the region, led by condiments in China and broad-based Australia growth, as well as strong e-commerce growth. Turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 19, second quarter constant currency sales decreased 16%, reflecting declines in the away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales declined 13%, driven by significantly lower sales to branded thru service customers, in addition to quick service restaurants. Partially offsetting the decline were increased sales to packaged food companies and pricing to offset cost increase. In EMEA, constant currency sales declined 31%. The decline was driven by a significant reduction in sales to quick service restaurant customers, in addition to lower branded thru service sales, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies and pricing to offset cost increases. In the Asia-Pacific region, flavor solution sales declined 6% in constant currency. The decline was primarily driven by the COVID-19 related lockdowns and closures in countries outside of China. As seen on slide 23, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, increased 21% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income grew by 23% and was driven by substantial growth in the consumer segment, partially offset by a significant decline in the flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment grew 68% to $232 million. The increase in constant currency of 70% was driven by higher sales and CCI-led cost savings. In the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 63% to $29 million or 61% in constant currency. The decrease was attributable to lower sales and an unfavorable impact to manufacturing cost, resulting from lower production volumes, with the partial offset of CCI-led cost savings. Gross profit margin expanded 230 basis points in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, driven primarily by favorable product mix, resulting from the sale shift between segments and CCI-led cost savings, with a partial offset from higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points, driven by the gross margin expansion. Turning to income taxes on slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18% and was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, primarily related to refinements to our entity structure. Our rate in the year-ago period was 18.9%, and was also favorably impacted by discrete tax items, principally stock options exercises. Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million in the second quarter, a 7% increase from the second quarter of 2019. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 27, second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.47 as compared to $1.16 for the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a higher adjusted operating income performance and lower interest expense. This increase also includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On slide 28, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $356 million through the second quarter of 2020, a 13% increase compared to $314 million in the first half of 2019, and was driven by higher net income. We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the second quarter at 36 days, down 6 days versus our 2019 fiscal year-end. We are projecting another year of strong cash flow. We returned $165 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $87 million for capital expenditures this period. In April, we raised $500 million through the issuance of a 10-year bond, with a 2.5% interest rate. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to further bolster our liquidity position in a volatile marketplace. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, including through acquisitions, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Let's now move to our outlook discussion and some of our expectations for the balance of the year as seen on slide 29. As a reminder, we withdrew the guidance that we issued in January during our first quarter earnings call in late March and we expected to resume guidance on this earnings call. While we recognize we have had strong performance thus far in 2020, we still have our typically largest quarters remaining, and there continues to be a high level of uncertainty around the pace and shape of the COVID-19 recovery and potential resurgences of the pandemic, as Lawrence mentioned. We've been running scenarios based on various assumptions. And given the wide range of possible outcomes, we are not providing guidance at this time. I would like to, however, highlight some current expectations that provide assumptions that help with modeling for the balance of the year. First, we expect the shift in consumer consumption will continue and the increased preference for cooking at home will be sustained, although not at the same elevated level as the second quarter, favorably impacting our consumer sector. In the flavor solutions segment, we expect the demand from our packaged food customers to return to the pre-COVID-19 levels, with continued variability by customer. We believe the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions portfolio is beginning to recover. We expect the performance to rebound gradually throughout the second half of the year. However, not returning to the same level as last year. As discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to project the COVID-19 impact to China will reduce our total global net sales by 1% to 2% for the year. We continue to expect mid-single digit inflationary pressures, CCI savings of approximately $105 million and a mid-single digit increase in brand marketing investment. In the first half of the year, our gross margin was favorably impacted by a higher mix of consumer segment sales. We do expect this mix shift to continue, but not to the same extent in the second half of the year. We realized incremental COVID-19 costs in the second quarter and expect them to continue in the second half of the year, more heavily weighted in the third quarter rather than the fourth quarter. We are anticipating a negative impact on our full year financial results from foreign exchange rates. And finally, our income from unconsolidated operations is expected to be significantly impacted by the unfavorable foreign currency rates. And as a result, we are projecting a high to mid-single digit decline. As Lawrence mentioned, we are focused on execution and are ready to perform in this dynamic environment as we have done thus far, no matter what the scenario. We are confident that we will manage through this period of volatility and continue on our growth trajectory. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and 2020 expectations in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 30. Our second quarter played out during an extraordinary period, and our results speak to the value of our product and to our capabilities as a company. Our ability to execute during the volatility of the quarter highlights our agility, strong foundation and engagement of our people. We will emerge a stronger company by focusing on our long-term strategies, responding to the changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on global and growing consumer trends, which are further accelerated during the crisis. We're confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment and continue on our growth trajectory. Our commitment to our long-term financial objectives has not changed. We're sustainably positioned for growth and will continue to deliver differentiated results. Now, let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please state your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi, there. Thanks for the question. On the outlook slide for the balance of the year, we talked about expecting elevated consumer segment demand for a period of time. And yet, the sales to the packaged food players within your flavor solutions business to return to pre-COVID-19 levels. And on the face of it, those two would seem maybe a little contradictory because if elevated demand in your branded business \u2013 would think we'd see elevated demand to other packaged food customers as well. Is it something with your customer mix maybe in terms of those customers in flavor solutions? Or is there potentially a little conservatism there if the broader sort of consumer packaged food landscape remains somewhat elevated on an ongoing basis, if you see what I'm getting at?\nLawrence Kurzius: I do see exactly what you're getting at, Andrew. And by the way, for you and for all of the participants on the call, we're sitting here with face masks on. And so, if we're a little bit muffled and hard to understand, please let us know and we'll try to speak up. The mix of customers within that sector is one of the factors. And there is a tremendous variability between our different customers, some of whom are still up solid double-digits and others who are down. For each one of them, there's a story that goes along with that. For some, they are also impacted by sales to food service and convenience store channel that have been depressed and are not up to current performance. Some of them are beverage manufacturers who will also have sales cut across both the at home and away from home channel. And many say, if not all, have curtailed some of their innovation and focus on a core group of items in order to meet the demand from the retail side of the business, which has also, in some cases, contributed to an impact on us. We did see an initial big surge from those customers during the during the stock up period and as they adjusted their supply chains, but we've seen that steadily settle as we've gone through the quarter. So, we do expect that to gradually return to a more normal rate. Also, I'll add, Andrew, that one of the things that's different about McCormick versus the rest of the industry is that, for most of our products, herbs, spices, seasonings, condiments like mustard and Frank's RedHot, it doesn't matter whether the consumer cooked the product at home or if they purchased it at a restaurant through takeaway. And part of the new normal for food service broadly is going to be a greater proportion of it being for a drive-thru takeaway away from premise consumption. And Frank's doesn't care if your bought it at home or if you cooked it at home.\nAndrew Lazar: Well, that Frank's thick buffalo ranch sauce, I can tell you, is being consumed like it's water with my college age son here at home.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you. We appreciate every package.\nAndrew Lazar: Great salad dressing too.\nLawrence Kurzius: The trial we've gotten on the new products we've launched has really been one of the long-term benefits that we've gotten from the crisis.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Ken.\nKen Goldman: Hey, guys. Two from me. One, you talked about \u2013 I think the phrase you said was canceled promotions. Many companies we talk to are talking about promotions being delayed to the back half of the year. You used the word canceled. It may just be semantics, but I was just curious if you feel those promotions will not necessarily come back in the back half of the year. So, I just wanted to get your color on what you're seeing from the environment on the deal space, from deal bag space. And then, the second question for Mike. Mike, you talked about the tax rate benefiting from entity structure refinements in the slides. Can you just give us a little more color on what those are and how they might affect your tax rate going ahead? Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Ken. I'll take the first part of that on the promotional activity, and I will gladly let Mike go over the tax question. I want to make sure that we're really clear on this point. We're definitely leaning into our brands through this crisis. Our brand building activity through our engagement with consumers, our advertising through traditional channels or through social and digital marketing has not only not been curtailed, but we've ramped those up. Consumers are very interested in cooking right now and we want to take advantage of that interest, get as much trial on our brands as possible, and it's part of us coming out of this as a stronger company. The promotional matters are a little bit different. Now, with a huge surge in demand, we've had to try to manage that demand. And so, curtailing our promotions and, in some cases, canceling promotions has been part of managing through that huge surge in demand. We have, in our US business, had a sustained surge in \u2013 growth in demand. I don't really want to call it a surge because it's not pantry loading. It's consumption. Over 50% across the quarter. And there just wasn't that much slack in our supply chain. So, we did, working with our customers, curtail promotions. And in some cases, they are genuinely canceled. We cannot go back and repeat the Memorial Day grilling promotions. That we can't. Those aren't going to happen. We are in a stronger, I'd say, supply position today, and we are reinstating our promotional activities. I would say, through May, we largely suspended trade promotion activity.\nKen Goldman: Thank you for that.\nMichael Smith: From a tax perspective, Ken, just to take you back, our underlying tax rate globally is about 24% to 25%. And it really goes up and down based on geographic mix. So, we do give you when we have visibility to discrete items, such as some of these legal restructurings we do, as we talked about earlier in January, even though it's underlying 24% to 25%, we said for the year to be around 22% because of some of the things we're doing. As a global company, through a lot of our global entities, we've been built through acquisitions. And as you make acquisitions globally, there's tax strategies that happen later on to take advantage of losses/gains around the world. So, we have a great tax team that works on these things. And you could probably teach a college class on this stuff, but it's very complicated. But it's really taking advantage of some of the global infrastructure we have. And we give you insight when we know those things can happen.\nLawrence Kurzius: Ken, before we\u2026\nKen Goldman: Yeah, sorry.\nLawrence Kurzius: Go ahead. Did you have any follow-up on the tax question because I want to come back to promotion for a second?\nKen Goldman: I hate to say I do. But I do. Just really quickly, Mike. I guess the implication is we should not be modeling anything necessarily unusual going ahead in terms of a reversal on that.\nMichael Smith: No, definitely not. No. 100% no.\nKen Goldman: Right. Right.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, Ken. Just one more point on the promotion. So, the lift that we're seeing in Nielsen and IRI and the share gains are coming in spite of curtailment of promotion. I just want to put that point out there.\nKen Goldman: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, good morning, Rob.\nRobert Moskow: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could zero in a little more on the inventory deloading that you saw in US retail. You mentioned that as one of the factors explaining the discrepancy between consumption growth and shipments. Do you have any sense of how many weeks of inventory you're down versus normal? And what's the plan for the back half of the year? Are you going to try to reinstate inventory levels back to normal? Or is it just kind of like hand to mouth for a while? Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: I'm going to say that, first of all, this reduction in inventory is not a plan by the retailer. The supply chain has been challenged to keep up with the surge in demand. It's been a challenge for us primarily on manufacturing capacity in the Americas. And it's been a challenging time for the retailers because of the surge in demand and their ability to actually receive product. And for a good part of this quarter, they were prioritizing things like paper products and sanitation products, which are pretty bulky, all of their time and ability to receive. It hasn't always allowed us to replenish inventory. But we're estimating at least there's a one week delay between the purchase and the restock signal. So, it's certainly at least a week that's been taken out of trade inventories. And retailers, definitely, are wanting to get in better supply. You can see it in the scan data. The points of distribution are down. That's reflecting in out of stock situations. We want to get that replenished and we're working towards that. Our ability to service this demand was really good in the initial weeks. But as it continued at a sustained rate, it really dipped as we went through May. And we took a lot of steps to initially expand just our logistics capabilities and capacity to meet the surge in demand and then shifted \u2013 and as we debottleneck that, our manufacturing capacity became a pressure point. So, we've taken steps to add workforce. We have optimized the schedules. And really by the fourth quarter, we'll either be 24/7 or 24/5 in all of our facilities, not just in the US, but around the world. We've made some short-term capital investments of our blending capacity. And we've brought on, frankly, some more comanufacturer as strategic partners in order to meet the surge in demand. So, we're really past the low point in our ability to service the customers which we hit right around the end of the quarter and our service has been improving week by week since then. And we think we're going to be in good position to meet the demand. And this inventory will be restored to the system, which they'll be a driver of some volume growth in the rest of the year, but the real key is just what happens with consumer demand and how strong is that strong preference for cooking at home continues for the rest of the year.\nRobert Moskow: And if I can ask a follow-up to that, is it time of year right now where you start talking to retailers about merchandising for the holiday season? And what would you normally tell them that would be different this time versus what you might have told them in the past?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah, that conversation is ongoing right now because, of course, retailers are concerned about supply for the holiday season. Right now, we believe that we're going to be in a good position to meet the fourth quarter demand that is very strong. And that's what we're guiding our retailers to.\nMichael Smith: The good news, Rob, is our holiday items tend to be longer runs and more efficient for us to produce. It's a different set than being produced now. So, that gets us some opportunity there.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Well, lots of cinnamon. All right, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning,\nAlexia Howard: Hi there. Okay, so two questions. Firstly, given that a consumer would only use a little out of a full spice jar to make a single meal, what gives you the confidence that we won't see a sharp slowdown in sales in consumer once those shoppers are fully stocked up on the range of different spices that they need for their repertoire of recipes for cooking from scratch? I guess I'm asking, could there be a temporary one-time cliff at some point? And then, my second question is, more broadly, given Dr. Fauci's recent comments about how chronic health conditions have contributed to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the African-Americans community in the US, how are you thinking about systemic issues like food deserts or food apartheid and the role that McCormick and the food system more broadly can play in addressing these problems of racial injustice? Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Two very different questions. And the last question has a number of different facets to it. So, I'm going to try to tackle both of those. First of all, many of our products are single use. A big part of the surge in demand that we're seeing is from our dry recipe mixes, for example, which would be a single use product or wet marinades or single use. And just the sheer level of increase in cooking says that consumers are going through their spice supply. We've had a very high level of repeat purchase even during the second quarter. So, consumers \u2013 we're getting certainly new trial, but we've had an 11% increase in repeat buyer rate at the same time that we've had a 16% increase in household penetration. And if you know how that works, usually when your penetration goes up, your repeat rate goes down for a period of time because they're bringing in lighter users. There's a high level of usage. And we don't see any evidence at all that consumers have built inventory in their pantries. It's just not a stock up category. We're a usage category. People are worried that they're going to run out of cinnamon, and so they buy three bottles, the way they might buy three packs of toilet paper. And so, we believe that consumers are buying for their immediate use and consumption. And we do not believe that there's going to be any kind of consumer need to destock. And I'll go even further out on that. But our own survey data because we're doing weekly tracker with consumers shows that most consumers only have a week or two of food on hand. And so, they're not stocked up on [Technical Difficulty] food. And the question of food deserts and healthful eating and social justice, I want to \u2013 I could make a speech on this and I actually have quite a few times. I'll try not to make too big a speech out of it. But first of all, our portfolio is generally advantaged in terms of health and wellness. Most of the products that we sell are inherently good for you. Herbs and spices, for example. And are either low or no in things like salt, sugar and fat. And they're available at a full range of price points and we sell in all channels. So, we're really widely accessible to people and whatever their income level or wherever they're, located. And even where they can't get to a store, our e-commerce and digital efforts allow access to delivery directly to their home. And the fact in economically hard times also, we tend to outperform just shows that our products are valued. As we've gone through this crisis, we've always supported food banks. As we've gone through this crisis, we've supported food banks in about 20 countries, and we introduced restaurant relief funds in cities like Baltimore and New Orleans, where we have significant operations ourselves and where those industries are meaningful employers and [Technical Difficulty] suffering. And our total support of food-related charities during this crisis has been about $2 million. We've made a billion dollar pledge early on, but we've potentially exceeded that pledge. Now, Alexia, there's a much broader issue of social justice, systemic racism. And McCormick I believe is one of the good guys on this issue. One of our foundational principles as a company is to empower people. And we're founded on the principle of respect for the individual and have longstanding programs to make sure that underrepresented groups have full opportunities for professional fulfillment within the company. And I think we set first internally an example with women and minorities and LGBTQ employees and other underrepresented groups to make sure that they are represented in McCormick leadership, all the way up to our very diverse Board of Directors, which includes four women, two blacks, one North African and a Latina. And we've been well recognized externally for this. We're one of the Diversity Inc.'s top 50 in terms of employment opportunities for minority and women and other underrepresented groups. The second thing is that we've spoken out publicly and have really taken some public stance that have generated some not always favorable response back to me personally. But we've taken public stance, both internal and external messages from the company and from me personally against racism, discrimination, injustice and explicitly in support of Black Lives Matter. So, we have spoken out on this issue. And beyond speaking, it's important to have action. We have strong development programs for women, especially in the US minorities, and we've committed incremental funding to combat racial injustice, provide food and healthcare \u2013 back to your original question \u2013 and other essential services to the black community. I hope that's a fulsome answer. And I'd be happy to follow up with you.\nAlexia Howard: Appreciate it. Thank you very much and hope to catch up soon. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Alexia.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, I wanted to first just follow-up on the supply chain. I think you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some raw materials where you're seeing some pressure. So, just wanted to get more color on that. And then, I have a follow up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. I'll be glad to say, first of all, I don't want to create a misperception. And so, I'm really glad you asked that question. I think that global sourcing has actually been one of the bright spots for us and has been a real differentiator that has enabled us to win through this situation. We have very thoroughly insight into \u2013 that sourcing might be a pressure point because of our operations in Wuhan, so we saw this crisis coming right at the beginning. And we began developing contingency plans and alternative sourcing all the way back in January. And I think we spoke about this on our year-end call and in some subsequent media the first week of February. So, this has been a real win for us. Any supply chain in any industry would have been challenged going through this, and so there have been a rolling series of challenges. But I will say that our ability to source raw materials and packaging has not had a material impact on our service, and we think that we're very much advantaged in this area.\nMichael Smith: As we've talked in the past, we source over 14,000 raw materials and packaging items globally. And as Lawrence said, we really have not had any significant shortages in sales due to that.\nLawrence Kurzius: Scale is an advantage in this. We're really the only \u2013 I would say only company with the scale to be able to have the resources on the ground in the actual sourcing areas for some of these raw materials, especially the most important ones. And that has proven invaluable and we've been able to work locally with local suppliers in emerging markets where many of our raw materials come from, work with local suppliers, local logistics and local authorities to keep our raw materials flowing.\nMichael Smith: When you see headlines like when the COVID hit in India they're shutting down the country, our global supply chains is able to work with those people to get our product out. So, they've done a great job.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay, great. And then, just the new US capacity addition that you had talked about, I'm curious if this is something that you had planned on doing that you were able to accelerate into this year. And I guess, the real underlying question, how are you thinking about long-term demand? Outside of just what's happening with COVID right now and the lap next year, do you think you're creating sort of a new generation of people who enjoy cooking or have at least gotten comfortable with it? Just your perspective around long-term demand would be helpful?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. Well, on the supply chain side, I'll take that part first, we did not anticipate that we would have this much growth in demand this year. So, the things that we're doing in our US \u2013 particularly in our US manufacturing to create additional capacity are all new things that we're doing in response to an incredible situation. We do have a long-term capital plan. We do actually have spoken externally\u2026\nMichael Smith: We were talking at CAGNY about it.\nLawrence Kurzius: Exactly. And for the past three years, our real focus, I think from a capital standpoint, has been building our capacity and capabilities in Asia and other emerging markets. Beginning this year, we were pivoting back to Western Europe and the US specifically. And so, we do have a number of big projects underway and this will only accelerate our thinking in that space. As far as the demand creation goes, right now, we really believe that consumers are going to continue to cook at home more for an extended period of time, which is going to be constructive to our growth. And further, the new normal for restaurants is going to involve more takeout consumption at home, as I mentioned in the earlier question. And that's also going to be constructive for our consumer brands of herbs, spices, seasonings, and condiments. The gains that we're getting in share of household penetration, which, by the way, translates to millions of new households, and the increased repeat rate that we're seeing all say that consumers are trying our brands and like them enough to buy them again, and they're clearly having good experiences that for many of them are going to be the new habit. Everybody's been cooking at home more and found it to be easy, fun and economical.\nFaiza Alwy: Perfect, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, Chris.\nFaiza Alwy: Hello. Good morning. Thank you. Appreciate the time this morning and all the color you've given. I just want to ask, first of all, two I think pretty easy questions. Have you rationalized your SKUs during this time? Are you focusing more on those core items? And then, what has that done to shelf space, was one of my questions? And then, the second question was just the COVID-related costs in the quarter. And I think you'd indicated they're going to be peaking in the third quarter. Does that mean they're higher than second quarter in Q3? And then, kind of how to think about, if you can, that level of cost overall?\nLawrence Kurzius: I'll take the first part of that and let Mike speak to the COVID costs. But in terms of SKUs, we have prioritized our top selling SKUs in order to maximize our throughput and service to the customer, which has meant that there's a group of, call them, secondary SKUs that have \u2013 where we've either suspended production or have just had to curtail production to more as available basis that we needed to do that to give us a longer runs on the on top seller. Again, we've done that in cooperation with retailers. As our capacity grows, we're adding those back. But we did do some SKU management. Now, I'd say one of the learnings that we got going through this, and which our retailers have gotten as well, is that SKU rationalization does bring some benefit in terms of efficiency and reduction of complexity. And so, I think that coming out of this, some of these SKUs will probably not ever put back into service and many retailers are also taking a look at their assortment and will probably carry a lower assortment going forward. I think they're also not just evaluating new SKUs, they're evaluating the brands that they carry. I think that retailers are going to want to simplify that business. And they're finding that some of the small brands that they were carrying had unnecessary duplication and complexity and justifying it aren't worth it. I think that contributes to the share gain that we're seeing. I think this is going to give us a lot more traction than second half of the year, particularly with our category management initiatives and the aisle reinvention program that we set for herbs and spices. Mike, do you want to take\u2026?\nMichael Smith: Hey, Chris. On the COVID costs, we estimate we're going to spend in the $30 million range from a cost of goods sold perspective for the year. It really splits between the second and third quarter. We don't see a lot in the fourth quarter. All that's pretty uncertain now, depending on how long COVID lasts. But I would just think the second and third quarter would be the biggest expense for things like essential pay we've had for our essential workers in the plants and DCs, paid leave, all the PPE we've had to buy, some small inventory write-offs. But think about a second, third quarter impact.\nFaiza Alwy: And just to be clear on that, Mike, there was a comment about 3Q being larger than 4Q, but does that necessarily mean that 3Q is larger than 2Q or is 2Q sort of the highest level of the year and then they're kind of still higher, but lower in Q3?\nMichael Smith: I think they're roughly the same.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Great. I appreciate all the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me. Mike, in the press release this morning, there was quite a bit of discussion around just fixed cost leverage and deleverage associated with the higher and lower volumes in the two kind of parent segments. I guess, just is there any way to dimension for us how much of the margin improvement or the deleverage was due to that fixed cost leverage as we think about it going forward? The volumes will obviously still be up in consumer, but maybe not as much. And that could help us from a modeling perspective on the margins.\nMichael Smith: Peter, you've read the book by Charles Dickens The Tale of Two Cities. This is really the tale of two segments. From a consumer perspective, obviously, with this huge volume increases, we've got a lot of great fixed leverage. On the other side, flavor solutions, we did not. For the company, it was really not that positive overall. What you're seeing at the gross margin line, a good \u2013 over half of that increase is due to the segment mix as consumer has higher margins than flavor solutions at the gross margin line and the operating margin line. It all depends on \u2013 over the next six months \u2013 what happens with that consumer demand and flavor solutions demand, but it was not a significant impact overall for the company from a fixed leverage perspective, especially as we've had some of this additional manufacturing related COVID cost in Q2.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. No, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of David Driscoll from DD Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thank you. Appreciate you sneaking me in here before it concludes.\nLawrence Kurzius: [Multiple Speakers]\nPeter Galbo: Okay. I'll try to make it a good one. I do want to follow-up on the margins. I want to say that the biggest variants that I think that happened in my model versus your actuals and consensus for that matter was the differential on margins, Mike. So, I want to go back over it. Sales up 8%, operating income up 21%. Specifically, in that consumer segment, margins up 600 basis points, maybe a little more than that, and volume up 25%. I really like this volume leverage point that was just brought up a second ago. And I know you blended it with the whole company. But if we just stay focused on the consumer segment for a moment, is it fair that the consumer segment was benefited by substantial volume leverage? I know the volume leverage probably works the other way in the other segment, but I'd just like to talk about consumer for a moment. Would it be fair to say that that's the number one point driving the consumer margin improvement? And then, honestly, the real point of all of this is to try to understand how to project forward. Your quarters have a lot of seasonality in terms of margins. If you were to get the same 25 point pop to volumes in Q3, in consumer that you got in Q2, could we just add 600 basis points to the consumer margin? Or is there some funny seasonal effects that would reduce those types of leverage? I just get worried about the seasonal pattern on your margins and how we might think about these factors given such tremendous impacts in the current quarter. Sorry for the long question.\nMichael Smith: I'll answer this and Lawrence can add to it. Generally, we build margins throughout the year, and I'll speak about consumer now. The fourth quarter is generally our highest margin business due to this holiday items. Second quarter was pretty extraordinary. There was a lot of leverage coming through the consumer due to the huge increases, mid double-digit, meaning 50% in some cases, of increases. I'd be a little careful, though, because things like \u2013 if you look at A&P for example, A&P for the company was up 1%, a couple more percent for consumer. Now, that being said, we're going to heavy up more in the second half to get to that mid-single digit guidance we've given. However, even though we didn't spend a huge percentage, you think like working media are up double digit globally if some of our CCI savings are coming through in A&P. So, we're actually really leaning into A&P. But you'll see that A&P line increase in the second six. So that will take 600 basis points down by some number. We had really good product mix in the quarter as well as segment mix. Within the consumer side, good product mix too. I'd just be a little careful about trying to take the second quarter and expand it out to the year.\nLawrence Kurzius: I also want to emphasize that we're not giving guidance because there's so much uncertainty and I don't want to run away with saying too much about gross margin here because that's getting us into an area of maybe providing more guidance than we are prepared to. But, certainly, the mix between the segments, to the extent that there's more consumption at home and less away from home, it's going to be a benefit to our margin. And correspondingly, that will have leverage \u2013 or deleverage based on those volume trends.\nPeter Galbo: And then, guys, if I could just sneak in one last one. Sorry, go ahead.\nLawrence Kurzius: No, no, that was good. Go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Okay, the other one, just because this is \u2013 I think it's reasonably important and hard to model, in your EMEA business, you've talked about the impact of QSRs and that, in Europe, it was just all but shut down in this past quarter. Where does it stand today? And do we \u2013 is it reasonable to think that those quick service restaurants are going to be doing plenty of drive-thru and take-outs, and so that business sees \u2013 your business sees a substantial improvement because you're just not in total lockdown like you were in this past quarter. So, I feel like there's a big variance coming right there. But pull me back if that's\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: No, no. I'm not pulling you back. I think we pointed to that. And actually, I thought we tried to get that clear in the remarks, but maybe not have. Our remarks were extraordinarily long and I apologize for that. The restaurant \u2013 the quick service restaurants in Europe did completely close down at the end of March. I'm not speaking out of school or there are customers, and so I don't want to get into guiding for their business. But all of their CEOs have been out publicly saying that they will close. So, that's out there. But they also all reopened in June, heavily towards drive-thru and pickup, but they have pretty much all reopened in the month of June. So, I would expect to see that better in the \u2013 our third quarter. And I'll say the challenge \u2013 I'll just mention, where we talk about supply chain, this was one of the challenges that we've had and where we've had to really be nimble and responsive because they shut down with a few days' notice to us, completely idling our facilities, and then they literally started back up with about a week's notice to us. So, we had to get cranked up and we've worked our way through it with them.\nPeter Galbo: Really appreciate the comments. And great job on the quarter, by the way. No one said it, but the results are stellar. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'll hand the call back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing comments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions and for participating in today's call, and I realize that it did go a bit long and I thank you for your patience. McCormick is a global leader in flavor and we're differentiated by the broad and advantaged portfolio which continues to drive growth. It's a growing and profitable business with a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in the volatile environment which we currently operate to deliver flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in industry and the world with new ideas, innovation and purpose. One of the most significant risks to any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We're all experiencing that disruption now and McCormick is well prepared to not only manage through it, but to emerge from it stronger. With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we're confident our strategies will enable us to become even better positioned to drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence. And thanks to all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please reach out to me. This concludes this morning's call. Thank you. Have a good day. And I hope everyone stays healthy and safe.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The last few months have been an extraordinary period and the global recovery from COVID-19 continues to evolve daily. McCormick's commitment to maintaining critical food supply across all of our markets and supporting our communities has been constant during these turbulent times. Across the globe, we've committed financial resources to many organizations to support frontline health care workers, emergency responders, and the restaurant and hospitality industries, including donating to food banks and causes nearly 20 countries to ensure reliable access to food to those most vulnerable during this ongoing pandemic. We're working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have three priorities, which we've spoken about since the first days of the crisis as we work through this period. The first is to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the quality and integrity of our product. The second is to keep our brand and our customers' brands in supply and maintain the financial strength of our business. And the third is to make sure we emerge stronger from this crisis. As a company, we've seen all phases of the pandemic, from lockdown starting in January to various stages of recovery today. Our businesses in China are fairly far along in recovery with the exception of the Hubei province, one of our most highly developed regions in China, which is in the early stages of recovery as it was under an extended lockdown through April 8. Other businesses in Asia-Pacific as well as the EMEA are about two or three months behind China with variations by market, with some markets beginning early recovery late in the second quarter. In the Americas, which is also about two to three months behind China, restrictions began to loosen late in the second quarter, with recovery currently in its early stages. Turning to slide five. Let me highlight a few points on the current conditions we're seeing and our potential impact. Our consumer segment was positively impacted early in the quarter by some initial pantry stocking in the Americas and the EMEA region and pantry replenishment in China. While these behaviors elevated consumption for a period, as the quarter progressed, strong consumption continued steadily across all regions. Our consumer survey data shows that strength was real incremental consumption driven by increased cooking at home. We believe the shift in consumer consumption to eating at home will continue, partially driven by the status of the restaurant and food service industry, as well as consumer confidence with eating out and significantly influenced by an increased preference for cooking at home, which we believe will be longer lasting. We don't expect the same level of consumption to continue for the balance of the year that we experienced throughout the quarter, or we do expect consumption to remain at some elevated level driven by the shift in consumer preference. Additionally, we would expect to benefit from consumers eating at home if we were to enter a recessionary period consistent with our historical sales performance during past recessions. As our second half of the year begins, we continue to see elevated demand from our customers and through scanner data. Turning to our flavor solutions segment, let's start with our sales to packaged food companies, which historically represents roughly half of our flavor solutions portfolio. Early in the quarter, we experienced surges in demand, which tapered off throughout the quarter and performance varied by customer. We expect overall demand consistent with pre-COVID levels in our second half. For our restaurant and other food service customers, we began the quarter with reduced demand as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets eliminated dine-in services and limited restaurants to carry out delivery only. As we expected, this had a significant negative impact on our second quarter performance, particularly in the EMEA region as most restaurants completely closed. Late in the quarter, we began to see and believe we will continue to see a gradual recovery, which again will vary by market. Quick service restaurants, or QSRs, are recovering quicker, with the rest of the food service building more slowly. In China, QSRs are largely open and traffic has returned to fairly normal levels. Certain markets in the Americas and EMEA, indoor dine-in service are beginning to open on a limited basis and outdoor dining options have reopened. In EMEA, QSRs' delivery and drive-thru options began to resume in June, and they are seeing initial surges in demand. As we begin our third quarter, we are seeing our away-from-home demand beginning to come back. Our restaurant and other food service customers have experienced significant disruption, are adapting their operating model, refining their menu offerings, focusing on core items and exploring alternative ways to drive demand to offset dine-in decline. And we're collaborating with them on their recovery efforts. Our global supply chain has been critical to our success during this period of volatility. It is an area of strength for us, and one of the reasons we will come through this crisis strong. Our global sourcing organization has been a real differentiator, quickly executing contingency plans of placing critical materials where needed since our early involvement in China and ahead of any demand surge. While we, of course, have experienced some raw material constraints, these have had minimal impact on our ability to meet demand. Coming into the crisis, there was more finished good inventory in the system, both for us and our retailers, than there is today. The sustained level of consumer demand, coupled with our added safety and flexibility measures, has put pressure on our manufacturing operations and services stressed in some areas. As we enter our typically largest quarters, we're expanding our workforce and increasing manufacturing capacity to optimize scheduling, investments and partnerships. By the end of the year, we will have added the equivalent of an additional plant of US manufacturing capacity. We have already passed the low points in our ability to meet demand and our service levels are improving weekly. We're positioning ourselves for continued success and confident of our capabilities and our ability to meet demand. I want to thank our supply chain employees for their remarkable effort, as well as our suppliers and customers for their partnership in this challenging operating environment. Given this evolving operating environment, while we recognize we've had strong performance thus far in 2020, we are not providing guidance due to the high level of uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 crisis for the balance of year, including the variation in consumer comfort with respect to eating away from home versus at home and its impact on consumption level, the pacing of restaurant and food service locations fully reopening in our various geographic markets, and finally, the possible impact of any resurgences of the COVID-19 virus. We're focused on execution and remain confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment, as we have thus far, and continue on our growth trajectory. I'm incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in these unprecedented times. And as the crisis subsides, we will come out a better company for driving our long-term strategies, responding to changing consumer behavior, and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength. Now, I'd like to focus on our second quarter performance, business update on consumer, flavor solutions segments. We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio as seen on slide seven, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced by our second quarter results. During the second quarter, the shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at home consumption drove a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand, as well as increases for the packaged food company customers and our flavor solutions segment. On the other hand, we've seen a sharp decline in demand from a restaurant and other food service customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio, which historically has represented approximately 20% of our total annual company sales. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption varied by region due to different levels of away-from-home consumption and age. While we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, underlying consumer demand continues to underpin our growth. We're confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio will continue to differentiate McCormick and position us for continued growth. In addition to our advantaged portfolio, several other key factors, as seen on slide eight, were underlying McCormick's strength in the second quarter. First and foremost, consumers were finding comfort in the brands they trust, and we are here today for them as we have been for over 130 years. We've pivoted our messaging as needed, and are connecting with our consumers to guide them and provide inspiration for their flavorful cooking. We've responded to the significant disruption and capitalizing on our capabilities across the organization, particularly our supply chain, sales force and marketing team, as well as through our collaboration partnerships, both internally and externally. We're all standing together to manage through this crisis. Let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results which speak to the value of our product and to our capabilities as a company. Our exceptional second quarter performance was driven by the substantial increase in demand for our consumer products as consumer saw great tasting experiences with rich, authentic flavor, healthy high quality ingredients, and cooking more at home. Our ability to meet the increased consumer demand and navigate through sharp declines in the away-from-home products in our portfolio highlights our agility in responding to the disruptions we've all experienced, while, importantly, keeping our employees safe. Our results reflect our strong foundation and the effectiveness of our strategies, as well as the engagement of our employees around the world. Together, we delivered considerable sales, operating income, earnings per share growth, each metric grew double digits in constant currency. Starting with the top line, second quarter sales increased 8% from the year-ago period, and constant currency sales grew 10%, mainly attributable to the higher volume of product mix in our consumer segment, partially offset by the sharp volume declines in our flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income increased 21%, including a 2% unfavorable impact from currency and adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points. These results were driven by higher sales, favorable mix and savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.47, 27% higher than the year-ago period of $1.16, driven primarily by our strong operating performance. Our second quarter results were exceptional, driven by our successful execution and enabled by the positive fundamentals we have in place to manage through this period of volatility. The investments we've made and the capabilities we've built, combined with our strong business model, prepare us to execute from a position of strength. We have confidence in our strategies, our underlying foundation is solid as we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives. Now let me spend a few minutes on our business updates. Starting on slide 10 with our consumer segment. Sales rose 26%, including a 2% unfavorable impact from currency. Constant currency sales grew 28%, significantly fueled by the COVID-19 crisis. Our pricing actions and growth plans were in place, yielding results before the crisis, and those plans have remained in place, although some adjusted and even strengthened to execute in this challenging time that help our consumers and customers navigate through it as well. In the Americas, our IRI data indicates our total McCormick US branded portfolio grew 55% during the second quarter, which is substantial and reflects the strength of our categories as consumers cooked more at home. And in the data just released this past Tuesday, for the week ended June 13, scanner sales for total US McCormick branded portfolio continued to be strong, growing 32%. While we expect consumption will not continue at this highly elevated level of our second quarter, you can see it as still strong, and we expect continued growth from an increase in consumer cooking at home to last for a period of time. Turning to our shipments, in constant currency, the Americas sales grew 36% during the second quarter. The difference between the US IRI scanner sales growth and our shipments can be attributed to a few factors. First, depletion of inventory to meet the incredible surge in consumer demand. Next, an increased level of pricing growth in the scanner data due to cancelled promotions and channel shift. And lastly, while we had significant growth in Canada, Latin America and private label sales, they paced behind the growth rate of US branded sales. Focusing on the US branded portfolio, not only did our consumption grow, but we also gained share in nine out of 11 categories, including spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes, hot sauce and mustard. The growth rates in the majority of our categories are outpacing the total store center-of-store growth rate. In fact, consumption in our portfolio during the second quarter grew twice the center of store rate. Our categories are not what consumers think about when stocking up. They are the categories consumers used to flavor the meals they cook at home. New and renovated products also contributed to our second quarter sales growth, such as our dry recipe mixes updated for instant pot preparation, offering an even more convenient solution, and our Frank's RedHot thick sauces, introducing Frank's flavor to dipping and topping occasions. Later this year, we'll expand Frank's even further with the launch of frozen appetizers, chicken bites and dips. And earlier this month, we relaunched our Old Bay hot sauce with expanded distribution just in time to heat up the summer. With the retailer focus on keeping core items on retail shelves, there has been some slowdown in the sell-in of our new product launches, but we're excited about the pipeline we will carry into next year. And those that we have launched have gotten exceptional good trial. We're growing our household penetration across our portfolio, with a 16% increase compared to last year, which is millions of new households gained and a significant amount of trials from those households was across multiple categories. Spices and seasonings, dry recipe mixes and hot sauce had the biggest gain. But even smaller brands like Simply Asia grew significantly. And our rate of repeat buyers increased 11% during the quarter, which is notable given that our repeat rate was already very robust. During the quarter, we launched our new US McCormick brand advertising campaign \u2013 \"It's Going to be Great\" \u2013 which is the strongest scoring campaign in our consumer testing history. This TV and digital campaign is focused on consumer education of what to make, how to prepare and build confidence in the kitchen, which is all even more relevant now as consumers cook more at home. We continued to design targeted media messaging to focus on cooking at home and drive-thru. We're planning to increase our brand marketing investment in the second half of this year. The speed and agility we gained with our marketing excellence organization has proved invaluable as we turn insight into action and can pivot to adjust our messaging even more efficiently and effectively to capture the moment. The team has rapidly generated insights, creating and deploying new videos and tutorials that range from easy weeknight meals using pantry staples, bread making and cocktails for virtual happy hour. This is critical to execute our plan to create deeper connections with our consumers by bridging their physical and digital experience, which is even more important today with consumers accelerating their online presence. Our consumers are looking for help and inspiration in the kitchen and we're here for them, with one of the ways being our Flavor Maker app. Organic search visits to our McCormick.com site were up over 200% in the second quarter versus last year, with consumers 18 to 34 years old driving the largest increase, searching for recipes and to learn to cook. The younger generation continues to fuel the demand for flavor, and we're executing some creative ways to connect with them. We're personalizing our interactions with consumers. As we have been all home together, our McCormick chefs invited consumers into their home kitchen for a new Cook With Us Instagram series, enabling one to one connection and putting a true face to McCormick. Consumers are tagging McCormick with posts of their user-generated content and we're engaging with them, including incorporating some of their content into our own ad, and providing users a chance to win a personal virtual cooking class with one of our chefs. And finally, it is essential to McCormick to support our communities, particularly at times of uncertainty. Our marketing and excellence organization has had tremendous success with their creativity and applied it recently to not only connect with consumers, but to make a difference in their lives. Today, we partnered with actress Drew Barrymore, and together hosted a virtual Taco Tuesday night called #TacosTogether in the hopes of encouraging others to augment McCormick's $1 million donation and support the No Kid Hungry campaign, working to ensure children have reliable access to food during this ongoing pandemic. #TacosTogether garnered over 800 million impressions across the media landscape, exceeding our own expectations of our reach, and importantly, creating visibility to this vital cause. Overall, we're confident all the initiatives we have underway will continue our growth trajectory, both with our valued existing consumers and those we're welcoming to our brand. Now, turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 26%, with broad-based growth across the region and market share gains in a majority of our categories in our significant markets. Growth in our Vahine\u0301 brand in France was excellent, led by vanilla and baking product. Urban spice consumption was strong in all markets, driven by consumers cooking more at home to discovering they need our product for great tasting, healthy flavor solution. The UK dry mix recipe mix category is attracting new shoppers, and purchase frequency is increasing as consumers seek convenient solutions. And our new products are driving the category growth, with the Schwartz brand continuing to gain share and retaining the leading positions we achieved last quarter. Our new product plans remain on track for the year across our EMEA portfolio, and we continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that elevated consumer demand will be met, even obtaining incremental placement for our branded portfolio with some retailers as other manufacturers face supply challenges. Our strong brand marketing campaigns and digital connections with the consumer contributed to our second quarter growth and provided us with confidence for future growth early in the quarter, which quickly shifted to increased digital advertising, search and social investments across key brands and markets using data-driven, real-time insights. For example, we created a social listening dashboard to understand the changing needs and topics most relevant to our consumers during the COVID-19 crisis. With baking being the highest trending topic during the crisis, we partnered with culinary websites to capitalize on over 600 pieces of user-generated baking at home social content to increase our interaction with consumers. [indiscernible] even further relevance, we created cooking at home website sections with health and wellness landing pages, including healthy recipes blogger content, combined with content from our BuzzFeed partnership highlighting recipes and our product. For example, the 13 herbs and spices everyone should have in their cover. Our execution of these baking and health campaigns drove over 20 million impressions each during the quarter. Moving forward, we'll continue to capture the momentum we've gained and our relevance with EMEA consumers through activation of similar programs, marketing campaigns, highlighting product superiority, culinary partnerships and our new product launches. In the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 13%, driven by our China business in the Hubei province where our Wuhan operation is located, which had an extended lockdown into early April. The Wuhan disruption negatively impacted the APZ consumer growth by 26 percentage points. Declines in branded food service products, which are included in our consumer segment in China, outside of Wuhan also contributed to the sales decrease. Excluding these impacts, sales for the region would have increased, reflecting the increase in consumer demand across the region related to the increase in cooking at home. In China, the consumer business outside of Hubei province is strong, with some products in our condiment portfolio doubling or tripling their sales for the second quarter of last year. Convenient solutions are being sought by consumers, driving growth of our recipe mixes, World Flavor hot pot sauces, as well as herbs and spices. And we're leveraging our new product successes on our direct-to-consumer platform and accelerating our new product launches, such as launching our squeezable healthy oil salad dressings, retailed during our third quarter. In other parts of the region which are lagging China from a recovery phase, we have broad-based growth and are gaining share in many categories. Across the entire region, we're also leading the consumer online and have pivoted our marketing plans for value and scratch cooking. Whether it be through our Frank's RedHot Tick Tock Fitness Challenge in China, our chefs providing inspiration and instruction on social media across the region, or through our Keep Calm and Curry On campaign in Australia, we're helping our consumers in augmenting the growth potential of the shift to cooking at home. In all regions, consumers' digital engagement has increased significantly during stay at home period, and we've seen an acceleration of our e-commerce growth in all categories, with second quarter triple-digit growth, whether it be pure play, click and collect or our own direct-to-consumer property in all of our major markets. We expect to shift to online shopping behavior to continue and we're well positioned for it through the investments we've made and continue to make in this channel. Our consumer portfolio and the plans we have in place are even more relevant today than they were before the crisis if we expect the increase in at home cooking to continue, which further bolsters our confidence that we will drive future growth. Turning to slide 12, in our flavor solutions segment, constant currency sales for the second quarter were lower by 16%, driven by the sharp declines in demand from restaurants and other food service customers, as away-from-home dining was significantly curtailed due to the COVID-19 restrictions, with a partial offset from continued growth in sales to our packaged food customers. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 impact, our underlying foundation is solid, and we've delivered strong sales growth margin expansion over the last few years, most recently 5% sales growth in the first quarter of this year and believe we would have continued our positive momentum. In the Americas, our sales declined 13% in constant currency. While we experienced demand declines across both branded food service and restaurant customers, branded food service had a more significant impact as our away-from-home customer base in the Americas does skew more to that channel and our quick service restaurant customers retain takeaway and delivery options, although with limited menus. In flavor solutions, we're differentiated by our customer engagement. And while our plans always included strengthening our intimacy this year, they were accelerated with some pivot by the COVID-19 crisis. Through our culinary and marketing support, we've been helping our customers adapt to the changing environment and eventually the new normal. From a culinary standpoint, we've developed virtual tools and are collaborating with our customers to provide solutions, such as modifying menus for carry-out, reinventing menu offerings with limited inventory, and optimizing recipes for COVID-19 safety protocols. And from a marketing perspective, we're leveraging the power of our brands, like Frank's RedHot and OLD BAY with strong promotional programs to help build menu excitement. Lastly, as many places will be moving away from tabletop condiments, we're pivoting to portion control packaging for dining and carryout. We're also exploring other options to expand our portion control offering further. In EMEA, where we had expected the most significant rate of decline from the COVID-19 measures, our sales were 31%, lower at constant currency than last year. Our away-from-home customer base in this region skewed more to QSR. And in late March, most of those customers completely closed the restaurant, not even drive-thru or carryout remained open. As I mentioned earlier, many of the QSRs adapted their model to reopen in June, offering limited menus for delivery and drive-thru, while dine-in remained close. They've established aggressive recovery plans, and we're demonstrating our speed and agility, scaling our operations back up and meeting customer demand on an accelerated timetable. In the Asia-Pacific region, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, closures and the curfews across the region outside of China, our constant currency sales declined 6%. China QSRs are largely open, and we're seeing momentum gain, with one QSR even launching a limited time offer which added to our sales this quarter. Across the rest of the region, government COVID-19 measures varied, as well as customers' ability to adapt. Where QSRs remained open in some capacity, the focus was on core items. For the balance of the year, we expect a reduced level from last year for our customers' limited time offers, which are an important growth driver in this region. Moving forward, we'll continue to work with all our customers to manage through the recovery phase as COVID-19 measures are lessened as strong and differentiated partnerships we built with our customers enabled our robust collaboration to navigate through the second quarter, we will continue to do so. We expect there will be a gradual recovery. As I mentioned earlier, the QSRs will recover more rapidly, with the rest of food service building more slowly. Based on this, combined with our different mix of quick service restaurants and other food service customers between the regions, we believe the pace of recovery of the away-from-home part of our business will vary from market to market. We're fully committed to helping all of our customers resume their operations, and expect the demand to return as the crisis passes, similar to what we're seeing in China's recovery. The duration of this current period is uncertain. The slow and evolving recovery process is dependent on many factors, including restrictions being lifted, venues fully reopening, and possible resurgences. We have positive fundamentals in place to manage through this period of volatility. And with our confidence in the successful execution of our strategies, we'll continue on our long-term growth trajectory in flavor solution. Now, I'd like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 13 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the global and growing consumer demand for healthy, flavorful cooking, as well as transparency around the source and quality of ingredients and the desire to buy heritage brands. This resonates even more today than ever before. Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category and we inspire flavor exploration across all markets through all channels that are aligned with consumers' demand for great taste, convenience, healthy options, digital engagement. Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach and our execution of effective strategies position us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our product and through our customers' product to drive sales growth. These long-term behaviors have not only remained intact during the crisis, but have been accelerated to even greater importance. No matter what, where or when people are eating and drinking, it is likely flavored by McCormick, and we are proud our McCormick brands are trusted by consumers and customers worldwide. We are continuing to drive sales growth, balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margin, and sustainably realize earnings growth. We have a solid foundation. And in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced, we're ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth. Our experienced leaders and employees are executing on our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for our shareholders, while reacting to changes accordingly. We delivered exceptional second quarter results during a period of great disruption, proving the strength of our business model. Our strategies are effective and reinforcing our confidence that they will continue to drive future growth. While we know the balance of the year will be impacted by an uncertain environment and ongoing challenges, we're confident in the strength of our underlying foundation and performance. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success, and thank them for their efforts, engagement and for adapting to this new environment. Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Thanks, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and 2020 expectations in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 30. Our second quarter played out during an extraordinary period, and our results speak to the value of our product and to our capabilities as a company. Our ability to execute during the volatility of the quarter highlights our agility, strong foundation and engagement of our people. We will emerge a stronger company by focusing on our long-term strategies, responding to the changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on global and growing consumer trends, which are further accelerated during the crisis. We're confident in our ability to perform in this dynamic environment and continue on our growth trajectory. Our commitment to our long-term financial objectives has not changed. We're sustainably positioned for growth and will continue to deliver differentiated results. Now, let's turn to your questions. Hey, good morning, Andrew. I do see exactly what you're getting at, Andrew. And by the way, for you and for all of the participants on the call, we're sitting here with face masks on. And so, if we're a little bit muffled and hard to understand, please let us know and we'll try to speak up. The mix of customers within that sector is one of the factors. And there is a tremendous variability between our different customers, some of whom are still up solid double-digits and others who are down. For each one of them, there's a story that goes along with that. For some, they are also impacted by sales to food service and convenience store channel that have been depressed and are not up to current performance. Some of them are beverage manufacturers who will also have sales cut across both the at home and away from home channel. And many say, if not all, have curtailed some of their innovation and focus on a core group of items in order to meet the demand from the retail side of the business, which has also, in some cases, contributed to an impact on us. We did see an initial big surge from those customers during the during the stock up period and as they adjusted their supply chains, but we've seen that steadily settle as we've gone through the quarter. So, we do expect that to gradually return to a more normal rate. Also, I'll add, Andrew, that one of the things that's different about McCormick versus the rest of the industry is that, for most of our products, herbs, spices, seasonings, condiments like mustard and Frank's RedHot, it doesn't matter whether the consumer cooked the product at home or if they purchased it at a restaurant through takeaway. And part of the new normal for food service broadly is going to be a greater proportion of it being for a drive-thru takeaway away from premise consumption. And Frank's doesn't care if your bought it at home or if you cooked it at home. Thank you. We appreciate every package. The trial we've gotten on the new products we've launched has really been one of the long-term benefits that we've gotten from the crisis. Thanks, Andrew. Hi, Ken. Hi, Ken. I'll take the first part of that on the promotional activity, and I will gladly let Mike go over the tax question. I want to make sure that we're really clear on this point. We're definitely leaning into our brands through this crisis. Our brand building activity through our engagement with consumers, our advertising through traditional channels or through social and digital marketing has not only not been curtailed, but we've ramped those up. Consumers are very interested in cooking right now and we want to take advantage of that interest, get as much trial on our brands as possible, and it's part of us coming out of this as a stronger company. The promotional matters are a little bit different. Now, with a huge surge in demand, we've had to try to manage that demand. And so, curtailing our promotions and, in some cases, canceling promotions has been part of managing through that huge surge in demand. We have, in our US business, had a sustained surge in \u2013 growth in demand. I don't really want to call it a surge because it's not pantry loading. It's consumption. Over 50% across the quarter. And there just wasn't that much slack in our supply chain. So, we did, working with our customers, curtail promotions. And in some cases, they are genuinely canceled. We cannot go back and repeat the Memorial Day grilling promotions. That we can't. Those aren't going to happen. We are in a stronger, I'd say, supply position today, and we are reinstating our promotional activities. I would say, through May, we largely suspended trade promotion activity. Ken, before we... Go ahead. Did you have any follow-up on the tax question because I want to come back to promotion for a second? Hey, Ken. Just one more point on the promotion. So, the lift that we're seeing in Nielsen and IRI and the share gains are coming in spite of curtailment of promotion. I just want to put that point out there. Hey, good morning, Rob. I'm going to say that, first of all, this reduction in inventory is not a plan by the retailer. The supply chain has been challenged to keep up with the surge in demand. It's been a challenge for us primarily on manufacturing capacity in the Americas. And it's been a challenging time for the retailers because of the surge in demand and their ability to actually receive product. And for a good part of this quarter, they were prioritizing things like paper products and sanitation products, which are pretty bulky, all of their time and ability to receive. It hasn't always allowed us to replenish inventory. But we're estimating at least there's a one week delay between the purchase and the restock signal. So, it's certainly at least a week that's been taken out of trade inventories. And retailers, definitely, are wanting to get in better supply. You can see it in the scan data. The points of distribution are down. That's reflecting in out of stock situations. We want to get that replenished and we're working towards that. Our ability to service this demand was really good in the initial weeks. But as it continued at a sustained rate, it really dipped as we went through May. And we took a lot of steps to initially expand just our logistics capabilities and capacity to meet the surge in demand and then shifted \u2013 and as we debottleneck that, our manufacturing capacity became a pressure point. So, we've taken steps to add workforce. We have optimized the schedules. And really by the fourth quarter, we'll either be 24/7 or 24/5 in all of our facilities, not just in the US, but around the world. We've made some short-term capital investments of our blending capacity. And we've brought on, frankly, some more comanufacturer as strategic partners in order to meet the surge in demand. So, we're really past the low point in our ability to service the customers which we hit right around the end of the quarter and our service has been improving week by week since then. And we think we're going to be in good position to meet the demand. And this inventory will be restored to the system, which they'll be a driver of some volume growth in the rest of the year, but the real key is just what happens with consumer demand and how strong is that strong preference for cooking at home continues for the rest of the year. Yeah, that conversation is ongoing right now because, of course, retailers are concerned about supply for the holiday season. Right now, we believe that we're going to be in a good position to meet the fourth quarter demand that is very strong. And that's what we're guiding our retailers to. Good morning, Two very different questions. And the last question has a number of different facets to it. So, I'm going to try to tackle both of those. First of all, many of our products are single use. A big part of the surge in demand that we're seeing is from our dry recipe mixes, for example, which would be a single use product or wet marinades or single use. And just the sheer level of increase in cooking says that consumers are going through their spice supply. We've had a very high level of repeat purchase even during the second quarter. So, consumers \u2013 we're getting certainly new trial, but we've had an 11% increase in repeat buyer rate at the same time that we've had a 16% increase in household penetration. And if you know how that works, usually when your penetration goes up, your repeat rate goes down for a period of time because they're bringing in lighter users. There's a high level of usage. And we don't see any evidence at all that consumers have built inventory in their pantries. It's just not a stock up category. We're a usage category. People are worried that they're going to run out of cinnamon, and so they buy three bottles, the way they might buy three packs of toilet paper. And so, we believe that consumers are buying for their immediate use and consumption. And we do not believe that there's going to be any kind of consumer need to destock. And I'll go even further out on that. But our own survey data because we're doing weekly tracker with consumers shows that most consumers only have a week or two of food on hand. And so, they're not stocked up on [Technical Difficulty] food. And the question of food deserts and healthful eating and social justice, I want to \u2013 I could make a speech on this and I actually have quite a few times. I'll try not to make too big a speech out of it. But first of all, our portfolio is generally advantaged in terms of health and wellness. Most of the products that we sell are inherently good for you. Herbs and spices, for example. And are either low or no in things like salt, sugar and fat. And they're available at a full range of price points and we sell in all channels. So, we're really widely accessible to people and whatever their income level or wherever they're, located. And even where they can't get to a store, our e-commerce and digital efforts allow access to delivery directly to their home. And the fact in economically hard times also, we tend to outperform just shows that our products are valued. As we've gone through this crisis, we've always supported food banks. As we've gone through this crisis, we've supported food banks in about 20 countries, and we introduced restaurant relief funds in cities like Baltimore and New Orleans, where we have significant operations ourselves and where those industries are meaningful employers and [Technical Difficulty] suffering. And our total support of food-related charities during this crisis has been about $2 million. We've made a billion dollar pledge early on, but we've potentially exceeded that pledge. Now, Alexia, there's a much broader issue of social justice, systemic racism. And McCormick I believe is one of the good guys on this issue. One of our foundational principles as a company is to empower people. And we're founded on the principle of respect for the individual and have longstanding programs to make sure that underrepresented groups have full opportunities for professional fulfillment within the company. And I think we set first internally an example with women and minorities and LGBTQ employees and other underrepresented groups to make sure that they are represented in McCormick leadership, all the way up to our very diverse Board of Directors, which includes four women, two blacks, one North African and a Latina. And we've been well recognized externally for this. We're one of the Diversity Inc.'s top 50 in terms of employment opportunities for minority and women and other underrepresented groups. The second thing is that we've spoken out publicly and have really taken some public stance that have generated some not always favorable response back to me personally. But we've taken public stance, both internal and external messages from the company and from me personally against racism, discrimination, injustice and explicitly in support of Black Lives Matter. So, we have spoken out on this issue. And beyond speaking, it's important to have action. We have strong development programs for women, especially in the US minorities, and we've committed incremental funding to combat racial injustice, provide food and healthcare \u2013 back to your original question \u2013 and other essential services to the black community. I hope that's a fulsome answer. And I'd be happy to follow up with you. Thanks, Alexia. Great. I'll be glad to say, first of all, I don't want to create a misperception. And so, I'm really glad you asked that question. I think that global sourcing has actually been one of the bright spots for us and has been a real differentiator that has enabled us to win through this situation. We have very thoroughly insight into \u2013 that sourcing might be a pressure point because of our operations in Wuhan, so we saw this crisis coming right at the beginning. And we began developing contingency plans and alternative sourcing all the way back in January. And I think we spoke about this on our year-end call and in some subsequent media the first week of February. So, this has been a real win for us. Any supply chain in any industry would have been challenged going through this, and so there have been a rolling series of challenges. But I will say that our ability to source raw materials and packaging has not had a material impact on our service, and we think that we're very much advantaged in this area. Scale is an advantage in this. We're really the only \u2013 I would say only company with the scale to be able to have the resources on the ground in the actual sourcing areas for some of these raw materials, especially the most important ones. And that has proven invaluable and we've been able to work locally with local suppliers in emerging markets where many of our raw materials come from, work with local suppliers, local logistics and local authorities to keep our raw materials flowing. Yeah. Yes. Well, on the supply chain side, I'll take that part first, we did not anticipate that we would have this much growth in demand this year. So, the things that we're doing in our US \u2013 particularly in our US manufacturing to create additional capacity are all new things that we're doing in response to an incredible situation. We do have a long-term capital plan. We do actually have spoken externally... Exactly. And for the past three years, our real focus, I think from a capital standpoint, has been building our capacity and capabilities in Asia and other emerging markets. Beginning this year, we were pivoting back to Western Europe and the US specifically. And so, we do have a number of big projects underway and this will only accelerate our thinking in that space. As far as the demand creation goes, right now, we really believe that consumers are going to continue to cook at home more for an extended period of time, which is going to be constructive to our growth. And further, the new normal for restaurants is going to involve more takeout consumption at home, as I mentioned in the earlier question. And that's also going to be constructive for our consumer brands of herbs, spices, seasonings, and condiments. The gains that we're getting in share of household penetration, which, by the way, translates to millions of new households, and the increased repeat rate that we're seeing all say that consumers are trying our brands and like them enough to buy them again, and they're clearly having good experiences that for many of them are going to be the new habit. Everybody's been cooking at home more and found it to be easy, fun and economical. Hey, Chris. I'll take the first part of that and let Mike speak to the COVID costs. But in terms of SKUs, we have prioritized our top selling SKUs in order to maximize our throughput and service to the customer, which has meant that there's a group of, call them, secondary SKUs that have \u2013 where we've either suspended production or have just had to curtail production to more as available basis that we needed to do that to give us a longer runs on the on top seller. Again, we've done that in cooperation with retailers. As our capacity grows, we're adding those back. But we did do some SKU management. Now, I'd say one of the learnings that we got going through this, and which our retailers have gotten as well, is that SKU rationalization does bring some benefit in terms of efficiency and reduction of complexity. And so, I think that coming out of this, some of these SKUs will probably not ever put back into service and many retailers are also taking a look at their assortment and will probably carry a lower assortment going forward. I think they're also not just evaluating new SKUs, they're evaluating the brands that they carry. I think that retailers are going to want to simplify that business. And they're finding that some of the small brands that they were carrying had unnecessary duplication and complexity and justifying it aren't worth it. I think that contributes to the share gain that we're seeing. I think this is going to give us a lot more traction than second half of the year, particularly with our category management initiatives and the aisle reinvention program that we set for herbs and spices. Mike, do you want to take...? [Multiple Speakers] I also want to emphasize that we're not giving guidance because there's so much uncertainty and I don't want to run away with saying too much about gross margin here because that's getting us into an area of maybe providing more guidance than we are prepared to. But, certainly, the mix between the segments, to the extent that there's more consumption at home and less away from home, it's going to be a benefit to our margin. And correspondingly, that will have leverage \u2013 or deleverage based on those volume trends. No, no, that was good. Go ahead. No, no. I'm not pulling you back. I think we pointed to that. And actually, I thought we tried to get that clear in the remarks, but maybe not have. Our remarks were extraordinarily long and I apologize for that. The restaurant \u2013 the quick service restaurants in Europe did completely close down at the end of March. I'm not speaking out of school or there are customers, and so I don't want to get into guiding for their business. But all of their CEOs have been out publicly saying that they will close. So, that's out there. But they also all reopened in June, heavily towards drive-thru and pickup, but they have pretty much all reopened in the month of June. So, I would expect to see that better in the \u2013 our third quarter. And I'll say the challenge \u2013 I'll just mention, where we talk about supply chain, this was one of the challenges that we've had and where we've had to really be nimble and responsive because they shut down with a few days' notice to us, completely idling our facilities, and then they literally started back up with about a week's notice to us. So, we had to get cranked up and we've worked our way through it with them. Thank you very much. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions and for participating in today's call, and I realize that it did go a bit long and I thank you for your patience. McCormick is a global leader in flavor and we're differentiated by the broad and advantaged portfolio which continues to drive growth. It's a growing and profitable business with a balanced portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in the volatile environment which we currently operate to deliver flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in industry and the world with new ideas, innovation and purpose. One of the most significant risks to any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We're all experiencing that disruption now and McCormick is well prepared to not only manage through it, but to emerge from it stronger. With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we're confident our strategies will enable us to become even better positioned to drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders."

            "name": "Michael Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin now by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance, and then discuss some of our expectations for the balance of the year. Starting on slide 15, during the second quarter, sales rose 10% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by substantially higher volume and mix in our consumer segment, offset by significant declines in our flavor solutions segment. The consumer segment sales grew 28% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMBA region. The shift to at home consumption and cooking more at home has driven substantial demand for our consumer products. Higher volume and mix primarily drove the increase, with pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributing. On slide 16, consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 36% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019. The increase was broad based, with significant growth across the McCormick branded portfolio, both in major channels and e-commerce as well as in private label products. Additionally, the pricing actions we took late in the first quarter to offset increased costs also contributed to the growth. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 26% from a year ago, with higher volume and mix in all countries across the region. The most significant growth drivers were our Vahine\u0301 homemade dessert products in France, our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings and our Schwartz dry recipe mixes. Consumer sales in Asia-Pacific declined 13% in constant currency, driven by the extended disruption in Wuhan, which as Lawrence mentioned drove a decrease of 26 percentage points to the region's consumer sales. This decline was partially offset by increased consumer demand across the region, led by condiments in China and broad-based Australia growth, as well as strong e-commerce growth. Turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 19, second quarter constant currency sales decreased 16%, reflecting declines in the away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales declined 13%, driven by significantly lower sales to branded thru service customers, in addition to quick service restaurants. Partially offsetting the decline were increased sales to packaged food companies and pricing to offset cost increase. In EMEA, constant currency sales declined 31%. The decline was driven by a significant reduction in sales to quick service restaurant customers, in addition to lower branded thru service sales, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies and pricing to offset cost increases. In the Asia-Pacific region, flavor solution sales declined 6% in constant currency. The decline was primarily driven by the COVID-19 related lockdowns and closures in countries outside of China. As seen on slide 23, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, increased 21% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income grew by 23% and was driven by substantial growth in the consumer segment, partially offset by a significant decline in the flavor solutions segment. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment grew 68% to $232 million. The increase in constant currency of 70% was driven by higher sales and CCI-led cost savings. In the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 63% to $29 million or 61% in constant currency. The decrease was attributable to lower sales and an unfavorable impact to manufacturing cost, resulting from lower production volumes, with the partial offset of CCI-led cost savings. Gross profit margin expanded 230 basis points in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, driven primarily by favorable product mix, resulting from the sale shift between segments and CCI-led cost savings, with a partial offset from higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points, driven by the gross margin expansion. Turning to income taxes on slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18% and was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, primarily related to refinements to our entity structure. Our rate in the year-ago period was 18.9%, and was also favorably impacted by discrete tax items, principally stock options exercises. Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million in the second quarter, a 7% increase from the second quarter of 2019. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 27, second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.47 as compared to $1.16 for the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a higher adjusted operating income performance and lower interest expense. This increase also includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On slide 28, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $356 million through the second quarter of 2020, a 13% increase compared to $314 million in the first half of 2019, and was driven by higher net income. We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the second quarter at 36 days, down 6 days versus our 2019 fiscal year-end. We are projecting another year of strong cash flow. We returned $165 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $87 million for capital expenditures this period. In April, we raised $500 million through the issuance of a 10-year bond, with a 2.5% interest rate. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to further bolster our liquidity position in a volatile marketplace. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, making investments to drive growth, including through acquisitions, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt. Let's now move to our outlook discussion and some of our expectations for the balance of the year as seen on slide 29. As a reminder, we withdrew the guidance that we issued in January during our first quarter earnings call in late March and we expected to resume guidance on this earnings call. While we recognize we have had strong performance thus far in 2020, we still have our typically largest quarters remaining, and there continues to be a high level of uncertainty around the pace and shape of the COVID-19 recovery and potential resurgences of the pandemic, as Lawrence mentioned. We've been running scenarios based on various assumptions. And given the wide range of possible outcomes, we are not providing guidance at this time. I would like to, however, highlight some current expectations that provide assumptions that help with modeling for the balance of the year. First, we expect the shift in consumer consumption will continue and the increased preference for cooking at home will be sustained, although not at the same elevated level as the second quarter, favorably impacting our consumer sector. In the flavor solutions segment, we expect the demand from our packaged food customers to return to the pre-COVID-19 levels, with continued variability by customer. We believe the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions portfolio is beginning to recover. We expect the performance to rebound gradually throughout the second half of the year. However, not returning to the same level as last year. As discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to project the COVID-19 impact to China will reduce our total global net sales by 1% to 2% for the year. We continue to expect mid-single digit inflationary pressures, CCI savings of approximately $105 million and a mid-single digit increase in brand marketing investment. In the first half of the year, our gross margin was favorably impacted by a higher mix of consumer segment sales. We do expect this mix shift to continue, but not to the same extent in the second half of the year. We realized incremental COVID-19 costs in the second quarter and expect them to continue in the second half of the year, more heavily weighted in the third quarter rather than the fourth quarter. We are anticipating a negative impact on our full year financial results from foreign exchange rates. And finally, our income from unconsolidated operations is expected to be significantly impacted by the unfavorable foreign currency rates. And as a result, we are projecting a high to mid-single digit decline. As Lawrence mentioned, we are focused on execution and are ready to perform in this dynamic environment as we have done thus far, no matter what the scenario. We are confident that we will manage through this period of volatility and continue on our growth trajectory. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions. From a tax perspective, Ken, just to take you back, our underlying tax rate globally is about 24% to 25%. And it really goes up and down based on geographic mix. So, we do give you when we have visibility to discrete items, such as some of these legal restructurings we do, as we talked about earlier in January, even though it's underlying 24% to 25%, we said for the year to be around 22% because of some of the things we're doing. As a global company, through a lot of our global entities, we've been built through acquisitions. And as you make acquisitions globally, there's tax strategies that happen later on to take advantage of losses/gains around the world. So, we have a great tax team that works on these things. And you could probably teach a college class on this stuff, but it's very complicated. But it's really taking advantage of some of the global infrastructure we have. And we give you insight when we know those things can happen. No, definitely not. No. 100% no. The good news, Rob, is our holiday items tend to be longer runs and more efficient for us to produce. It's a different set than being produced now. So, that gets us some opportunity there. As we've talked in the past, we source over 14,000 raw materials and packaging items globally. And as Lawrence said, we really have not had any significant shortages in sales due to that. When you see headlines like when the COVID hit in India they're shutting down the country, our global supply chains is able to work with those people to get our product out. So, they've done a great job. We were talking at CAGNY about it. Hey, Chris. On the COVID costs, we estimate we're going to spend in the $30 million range from a cost of goods sold perspective for the year. It really splits between the second and third quarter. We don't see a lot in the fourth quarter. All that's pretty uncertain now, depending on how long COVID lasts. But I would just think the second and third quarter would be the biggest expense for things like essential pay we've had for our essential workers in the plants and DCs, paid leave, all the PPE we've had to buy, some small inventory write-offs. But think about a second, third quarter impact. I think they're roughly the same. Peter, you've read the book by Charles Dickens The Tale of Two Cities. This is really the tale of two segments. From a consumer perspective, obviously, with this huge volume increases, we've got a lot of great fixed leverage. On the other side, flavor solutions, we did not. For the company, it was really not that positive overall. What you're seeing at the gross margin line, a good \u2013 over half of that increase is due to the segment mix as consumer has higher margins than flavor solutions at the gross margin line and the operating margin line. It all depends on \u2013 over the next six months \u2013 what happens with that consumer demand and flavor solutions demand, but it was not a significant impact overall for the company from a fixed leverage perspective, especially as we've had some of this additional manufacturing related COVID cost in Q2. I'll answer this and Lawrence can add to it. Generally, we build margins throughout the year, and I'll speak about consumer now. The fourth quarter is generally our highest margin business due to this holiday items. Second quarter was pretty extraordinary. There was a lot of leverage coming through the consumer due to the huge increases, mid double-digit, meaning 50% in some cases, of increases. I'd be a little careful, though, because things like \u2013 if you look at A&P for example, A&P for the company was up 1%, a couple more percent for consumer. Now, that being said, we're going to heavy up more in the second half to get to that mid-single digit guidance we've given. However, even though we didn't spend a huge percentage, you think like working media are up double digit globally if some of our CCI savings are coming through in A&P. So, we're actually really leaning into A&P. But you'll see that A&P line increase in the second six. So that will take 600 basis points down by some number. We had really good product mix in the quarter as well as segment mix. Within the consumer side, good product mix too. I'd just be a little careful about trying to take the second quarter and expand it out to the year."

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. In addition, as a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements, as results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. It is important to note, these statements include expectations and assumptions which will be shared related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As seen on slide two, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors including the impact of COVID-19 that could affect our financial results.It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. To start, I\u2019d like to comment on the extraordinary and continually evolving global impact of COVID-19. On behalf of everyone at McCormick, I\u2019d like to first express our deepest sympathies to all those who are affected by COVID-19 and thank those working to keep people safe through this crisis.McCormick is committed to maintaining critical food supply across all our markets and supporting our communities. We are working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful.We have three priorities while navigating through this period of volatility and uncertainty. First, to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the quality and integrity of our product.Second, to keep our brands and our customers brands and supply and maintain the financial strength of our business. Our third priority is to ensure McCormick emerges strong from this event. It will come to an end. We will come out a better company by driving our long-term strategies responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength.We\u2019re taking steps to safely operate our business and supply our customers. We continue to operate our supply chain without significant disruption. We have implemented contingency planning with most employees working remotely where possible.We have global and regional crisis teams in place, continually monitoring the rapidly evolving situation and recommending risk mitigation actions. And we\u2019ve implemented travel restrictions, visitor protocols and social distancing practices, as you would expect.We\u2019ve also recently announced incentives to further recognize and support employees who work on-site in locations critical to keeping our operations running globally. We will increase hourly wages, further extend sick leave to support family members and maintain salaries if operations are suspended. It\u2019s essential that we show our appreciation to employees, while doing our part for the betterment of public health and to support our communities.And moving to slide five, to highlight a few points on the current conditions we\u2019re seeing and the potential impact. First, as we mentioned at CAGNY, the significant disruption in China\u2019s consumption in the first quarter impacted our results.The events in China during the second half of the quarter were extraordinary. While total McCormick sales follow a seasonal pattern with the first quarter generally the lightest, the first quarter is typically our peak season in China.Additionally, over half our China business relates to away-from-home consumption. And Hubei province is one of our most highly developed regions due to the DaQiao brand being founded and made in Wuhan. This made the China lockdown with an extended lockdown in Hubei, coupled with no opportunity for consumers to stock their pantries to be a significant impact.We believe we cannot use the China results to extrapolate the overall impact for the rest of the company due to differences related to lockdown durations, pantry stocking opportunities, as well as the different percentages of foodservice business and other dynamics in each region.The disruption in China resulted in a 3% reduction in total company first quarter sales and reduced our total consumer and flavor solutions segment sales 5% and 1%, respectively.As a reminder, in China, our Consumer segment includes the branded foodservice component, because those foodservice products use the same packaging format and share a common distribution channel, particularly in traditional trade and in the smaller markets as other consumer products in China.The lower operating income from China impacted the total company\u2019s growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by 10%. Currently, during the early stages of recovery in China, we are seeing increased cooking at home and a surge in consumer retail demand, both in stores, as well as through e-commerce and the start of a recovery in foodservice as most restaurants and caterers reopen and consumer confidence gradually builds.We expect China\u2019s results to be significantly impacted in the second quarter, as well as the market begins to recover gradually. The lockdown in Hubei continued through March and as recently announced is expected to be lifted in April.For the year, we expect lower China sales from the COVID-19 impact will reduce our total net sales growth by 1% to 2%. And as I already mentioned, we currently believe COVID-19 impact in China cannot be extrapolated to the overall COVID-19 impact for the rest of the company.Turning to the current status of our major markets outside of China, our presence in China afforded us the insight of seeing how COVID-19 scenarios can unfold, as well as to take early action.Our supply chain business continuity plans have been in effect since January. We have assessed and implemented continuity plans to provide customers with continued supply. To-date, there has been no material impact on supply for most of our sourced materials and for those impacted continuity plans have been activated.We are partnering with our customers to monitor and respond to changes in consumer demand. We\u2019re seeing increased consumer consumption both through our scanner data and e-commerce, as well as through customer orders, including those from packaged food companies in our flavor solutions segment.While this increase is impacted by short term pantry stocking, we expect some level of elevated demand for at home cooking to continue. Schools are closed, people are staying at home, and that contributes to real incremental at home consumption.We also know from our sales performance during recessionary periods, we benefit from consumers eating at home. Our constant currency total consumer segment organic sales growth in 2001 and 2009 was 4% and 3% respectively.On the other hand, in the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions segment, which represents approximately 20% of our total company sales, we are now seeing reduced demand from our foodservice customers as COVID-19 measures have eliminated in dine-in services and limited restaurants to carry out our delivery-only. We expect this will have a significant negative impact on our near term performance, particularly in our EMEA region, as more people stay at home and away-from-home options remain limited.To maximize flexibility during this uncertain time, we\u2019ve decided to moderate the pace of our enterprise resource planning or ERP replacement program. While we remain excited about and committed to our global transformation initiative, we believe that it is more prudent given current challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation to re-phase the timing of this initiative as we focus on the three priorities that I previously described.Now I\u2019d like to focus on our first quarter results, highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segment and finally, our growth drivers in relation to the current environment.Turning on slide seven. In our first quarter, the lower operating results from the COVID-19 impact in China, I just mentioned, offset the otherwise solid sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth we delivered, driven by the successful execution of our strategy and engagement of employees. This while also making business transformation investments.We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Across our portfolio, in our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA region, we drove particularly strong flavor solutions sales growth in the first quarter.In our Asia Pacific region, the China disruption significantly affected our first quarter sales growth across both segments of our - across both of our segments with a greater impact in consumer. Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio will continue to be the foundation for sales growth. And while we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, we\u2019re confident that underlying consumer demand will continue to underpin long-term growth.Now let me cover the highlights of our first quarter performance. Starting with our topline for the first quarter versus the year ago period, total sales declined 2%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from currency and a 3% unfavorable impact from China, partly offset by 2% growth contributed by the rest of the business, driven by higher volumes and product mix, as well as pricing.Adjusted operating income was down 2%, with minimal impact from currency and included a 10% unfavorable impact from China results. Partly offsetting this impact was the sales growth across the rest of the business and savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI.During the quarter, we also had higher brand marketing and ERP replacement program investments compared to last year. At the bottom line, our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was lower than $1.12 in the prior period or decline of 4%. This decline includes a 10% unfavorable operating impact from China and a 5% headwind due to a higher adjusted tax rate.As we said on our year-end earnings call in January and at CAGNY in February, we have confidence in our strategies and notwithstanding the COVID-19 impact, our underlying foundation is strong, and we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives.Now, let me spend a few minutes on our business updates. Starting on slide eight with our consumer segment. Constant currency sales declined 6% in the first quarter, including an unfavorable 5% China impact.The America constant currency sales declined 2%. We believe we substantially undershipped consumer consumption due to normal seasonal trade inventory reductions versus building some inventory levels in the first quarter of 2019. We estimate this resulted in a negative 4% impact to the Americas growth for the quarter.This is in line with our expected trade inventory impact to net sales for the year, which is also consistent with our historical performance. Today, it\u2019s hard to comprehend that there were retailers reducing inventory in the first quarter, the world has changed so much.In US spices and seasonings, we are maintaining the share stabilization we achieved last year. Our IRI data indicates US McCormick branded spices and seasoning scanner sales grew in line with the category and we had strong growth in unmeasured channels, particularly in e-commerce. We believe for the combined channels, McCormick branded slightly outpaced the spices and seasonings category growth. In McCormick branded dry recipe mixes, we continued our growth momentum, delivering share growth for the 10th straight quarter.Our first quarter performance included our sixth sequential quarter of accelerating consumption growth across our condiment portfolio. In total, we grew consumption 4%, as well as growing share in many of our product lines.Frank\u2019s RedHot Sauce had strong performance again, partially driven by effective Super Bowl marketing and promotion programs. Stubb\u2019s Barbecue and McCormick Manasive grew double-digits, and French\u2019s Mustard continued its consumption and share growth momentum.Our category management initiatives, effective marketing support and merchandising execution, expanded distribution and new products are all contributing to driving our category leadership and our momentum. We\u2019re confident in our initiatives underway to continue our long-term growth trajectory.In March, we\u2019re seeing an unprecedented surge in demand from customers and consumers at the worst [ph] the single-digit changes we\u2019re discussing related to our first quarter results and I\u2019ll say more about this in a moment.Now turning to the EMEA region. We had growth in UK and France, driven partially by new products and brand marketing support. New dry recipe mix products, such as the launch of our One Pan line, contributed to us not only gaining share in the quarter, but also to have the leading UK recipe mix position.In the Asia, Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined, driven by the significant impact in China, as I previously mentioned. In other parts of the region, we continued to gain momentum with effective brand marketing and promotions, as well as through e-commerce. Our fundamentals in our consumer business remain strong.Turning to slide nine in our Flavor Solutions segment, our performance was excellent, with constant currency sales growth of 5%, driven by the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by the decline in the Asia, Pacific region.In Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 5%. We had broad-based growth across our portfolio, both through our product category and customer perspective. Strong growth to both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants was driven by new products and base business growth.Our momentum in branded foodservice continued with robust growth, driven by new products such as Old Bay Hot Sauce, promotional activity with operators and expanded distribution.In addition to driving top line growth, we also continue to migrate our portfolio to more value-added categories. Our sales growth in EMEA was outstanding, 9% in constant currency as the strong momentum we have built in this region continued into the first quarter.We are winning with our customers both quick service restaurant and packaged food companies through new products, their promotional activities and expanded distribution.In the Asia, Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined, driven by the significant impact of China, in other parts of the region, sales to quick service restaurants drove growth.Turning to slide 10 to talk about our growth drivers in the current environment. Just six weeks ago at CAGNY, we shared with you our 2020 growth plan aligned to our strategy designed to build long-term value for our shareholders.We are now operating in a more dynamic and rapidly changing environment and were at CAGNY and possibly ever before and need to be agile in responding to the current dynamics and the changing consumer behaviors.Our overall growth plans have not changed, although some have been adjusted and even strengthened to enable us to effectively execute in these challenging times and the balance of the year and to capitalize on the opportunity to help our consumers and our customers through this difficult time.First, across both segments, we are currently focused on keeping our brands and our customer brands and supply, feeding particularly strong demand for items in key categories for spices and herbs, seasoning blends providing flavor solutions, dry recipe mixes, offering convenience, condiments, rice [ph] mixes, frozen products, stocks and broth and snack seasonings. The continuity of meeting demand, including the quality and integrity of our product is a critical priority.Turning specifically to our consumer segment, our 2020 plan includes to further drive our undisputed leadership in spice and seasonings, accelerate our condiment global platform, and fuel our growth at emerging markets and channels, as well as an on-trend, fast-growing platform.We\u2019re strengthening our connection with the consumer, especially with digital, e-commerce and social media outreach, which is even more important today with consumers at home more and looking for solutions. Simply put, our consumer portfolio and plans are even more relevant today than they were before.We are seeing an incredible surge in demand from consumers stocking their pantries and cooking at home, as our other consumer packaged companies. For example, for the week ended March 15th, scanner sales for the total McCormick US branded portfolio grew 65%, with all major categories up double or triple digits. While we expect consumption will not continue at this extraordinary level, we do expect sustained growth from an increase in consumers cooking at home.Now, taking a deeper look at our plans. Brand marketing is a key driver of sales growth and we\u2019re increasing our investments in 2020 as planned. The speed and agility we gained with our marketing excellence organization has enabled us to quickly pivot and adjust our messaging in light of the COVID-19 developments.For instance, we\u2019ve changed content to focus on at home family times which is more relevant than the current environment. A few weeks ago, we launched our new US McCormick brand advertising campaign with the tagline; It\u2019s Gonna Be Great, which is the strongest going campaign in our consumer testing history.This TV and digital campaign is focused on consumer education on what to make, how to prepare, and build confidence in the kitchen, which is all the more relevant today as consumers cook more at home.Our plans to create even deeper connections with our consumers by bridging their physical and digital experiences have been underway since early this year. We continue to develop best-in-class content and opportunities for our consumers to connect with us and are strengthening our brand as an indispensable partner on their flavor journey. These opportunities have now increased and even go beyond their flavor journey.Consumer engagement with our McCormick properties, such as mccormick.com, YouTube, and our social channels has increased high double-digits in recent weeks, both in visits and time spent. And we have a steady stream of new real-time content that is focused on solutions to the questions consumers are asking.Here are some examples. How to occupy the kids at home? Of course, with kid-friendly recipes from painted sugar cookies to scented slime or window clings, and we\u2019re seeing increased consumption in related product. US scanner sales shown vanilla is up 54% for example, in the weekend of March 15th.While recipes and products help with health and wellness, our content and recipes on turmeric and bone broth, as well as soup recipes, for example, have increased and we\u2019re continuing our work to promote the health benefits of spices and herbs. Our U S consumption growth on our stocks and broth was up 140% and turmeric up 22% during the same period.How to create flavorful meals with items that have been stockpiled? Cantuna eggs and pasta are frequent searches, and we have and will continue to create content to add flavor to these items and more. Consumers want more convenient solutions to add flavor, as evidenced by recent 104% U.S. consumption growth in dry recipe mixes.And finally, consumers can now use our newly added ask McCormick feature on our social channel, where we respond real-time with tips, tricks, recipes and products. We are now there with whatever consumers need to help them through these times.The investments we\u2019ve made in e-commerce have not only driven growth, but positioned us well for acceleration, which is what we\u2019re experiencing and for which we are prepared. Consumer shopping behavior is changing and the opportunities we\u2019re activating by making all touch points shoppable are paying off.In China, traffic to our direct-to-consumer platform has increased four times, driving sales growth up triple digits, increasing fivefold since the beginning of the year. In the US, we\u2019re seeing increased traffic and sales as well. Our pure-play and direct-to-consumer sales have tripled in recent weeks. This is also true in EMEA, with direct-to-consumer sales tripling as well. We\u2019re making our products even more discoverable to consumers with increased support.Our exciting first half new product launches, align with consumers demands for convenience, health and transparency, as well as flavor exploration and experimentation. We continue to drive category leadership and in the US, our enthusiastic and committed about our initiative underway to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasoning.By introducing new merchandising elements, we have had strong favorable customer reaction and began the rollout earlier this year. As we partner with retailers to maintain stock shelves and business continuity, we will have some delay in our rollout plan. With increased cooking at home expected to be a longer term trend, this initiative becomes even more exciting and relevant.Now, turning to our Flavor Solution segment. Our immediate focus is on responding to the volatility we\u2019re seeing across the segment. As a reminder, in flavor solutions, we operate across a wide range of customers and channels, consumer manufacturers, restaurants and distributors.Over 50% of our flavor solutions portfolio are flavors and ingredient product categories, are primarily sold to packaged food companies. Demand from these customers is currently strong as they are experiencing the same increase in consumption as we are in our consumer segment.In contrast, our restaurant and distributor customers are experiencing significant short term pain related to the reduction of people traveling, shopping and dining out, with many restaurants and away-from-home eating locations closed. Consequently, we are expecting a sharp and negative impact on the demand for our products from these customers.While we expect this demand to return once the COVID-19 crisis passes, similar to the beginning stages of recovery we\u2019re seeing in China, the duration of this current period of reduced demand is uncertain given changing conditions across the world almost daily.Our current flavor solutions priority is to work with all of our customers, those seeing demand surges, as well as those under pressure, managed through the coming months. We have confidence that the strong and differentiated partnerships we have built with our customers, which includes the top 10 food and beverage companies, as well as the top 10 food service restaurant chains enables a robust collaboration needed to navigate through this situation as best as possible.Now I\u2019d like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 12 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the global and growing consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating, as well as transparency around the source and quality of ingredients and the desire to buy brands from environmentally and socially responsible companies.Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category as we inspire flavor exploration across all markets through all channels and are aligned with the consumers demand for taste, convenience, health and sustainably minded business practices.Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach, and our execution of effective strategies positions us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our products and through our customers products and drive sales growth.No matter what, where or when people are eating or drinking, it is likely flavored by McCormick. We believe these long-term behaviors will remain intact following the current crisis.We\u2019re continuing to drive long-term sales growth balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins and sustainably realize long-term earnings growth. We have a solid foundation and an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast-paced we are ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth.Our experienced leaders and employees are executing on our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for shareholders while reacting to changes accordingly and capitalizing on opportunities.Excluding the China COVID-19 impact, we delivered solid first quarter results, again, proving our strategies are effective and we\u2019re confident they will drive future growth. While we know the balance of the year will be impacted by an uncertain environment, we\u2019re confident our underlying foundation and performance remains strong.I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success and thank them for their efforts, engagement and for adapting to this new environment during this volatile time.As food and food products have been designated to critical industry, I want to particularly thank our many employees who are working hard every day to protect the food supply and are rallying to support McCormick and their communities.Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Smith: Thanks, Lawrence. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin now by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance and then discuss some of our expectations for the balance of the year.Starting on slide 14, during the first quarter sales declined 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by the COVID-19 impact in China, which had a negative 3% constant currency effect on the total company.Excluding the impact of China, favorable volume and product mix from base business and new products, as well as pricing drove sales growth. The consumer segment sales declined 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by the Asia, Pacific region.On slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2019. As Lawrence described earlier, the decline was driven by trade inventory reductions, with a partial offset from pricing actions which were taking late during the first quarter.In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales were up 1% from a year ago, driven by pricing, primarily related to the timing of trade promotional activities. Consumer sales in Asia Pacific declined 28% in constant currency, driven by the China disruption. Growth was strong across the rest of the region.Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on slide 18, we grew first quarter constant currency sales 5% due to strong growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 5%, driven by new products and base business volume growth, with particular strength of snack seasonings and branded food service. Additionally, pricing also contributed to growth across the portfolio.In EMEA, we grew flavor solutions sales 9% in constant currency. Sales increased to both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies, driven by new products and volume growth on the base business, as well as pricing. In the Asia, Pacific region, flavor solutions sales declined 4% in constant currency, driven by the decline in China. Other parts of the region drove growth.Across both segments are seen on slide 22, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, declined to 2% in the first quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency.Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined to 12% to $120 million, which in constant currency was an 11% decline. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose to $76 million, a 19% increase, with minimal impact from currency.Both segments were negatively impacted by the China disruption, which was a 10% impact to the total company and was skewed more to the consumer segment, as well as incremental investments related to our ERP replacement program, with partial offsets from CCI-led cost savings and lower incentive-based compensation.Additionally, the consumer segment\u2019s adjusted operating income was unfavorably impacted by an increase in brand marketing expenses and flavor solutions was favorably impacted by product mix.Gross profit margin expanded 90 basis points in the first quarter versus the year-ago period, driven by CCI-led cost savings. We have adjusted operating margin compression of 10 basis points, driven by the factors I just mentioned.Turning to income taxes on slide 24. Our first quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18.4%, as compared to 13.9% in the year-ago period. Fourth quarter\u2019s adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, primarily related to refinements to our entity structure, which had a more significant impact last year.Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million in the first quarter of both years. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 26, first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.08, as compared to $1.12 for the year-ago period.The decline was primarily driven by the China disruption impact and a higher adjusted income tax rate from last year, with partial offsets from higher adjusted operating income growth, excluding China, and lower interest expense.On slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $45 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was driven by timing associated with working capital, as well as employee incentive and benefit payments.We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the first quarter at 40 days, down three days versus our fiscal year end. We returned $82 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $39 million for capital expenditures this period.We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our operating, investing and financial needs through our operating cash flows, as well as our access to bank lines and commercial paper. We have been able to access commercial paper markets as needed during the recent period of market volatility and currently have unutilized capacity under our $1 billion corporate revolver.We have no material debt maturities until 2021, and we expect no material change to our capital allocation. We continue to evaluate the market to determine if there is an opportunity to further bolster our position given the low underlying interest rates.Let\u2019s now move to a discussion about our outlook and some of our expectations for the balance of the year, as seen on slide 28. As a reminder, the guidance we issued in January and discussed at CAGNY does not include any impact from COVID-19.We are operating in a very fluid environment. And our ability to assess the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is affected by both the speed at which the situation is evolving, as well as the high degree of uncertainty related to the duration and extent of the impact on consumer demand in all channels and the global economy.We are also still early in our fiscal year, with three quarters remaining, including those that are typically our largest ones. We therefore are withdrawing our previously issued 2020 financial outlook discussed on our January earnings call. I would like to, however, provide additional perspective to highlight some current expectations.First, as we have already mentioned, there was a significant COVID-19 impact from China to our first quarter results, and we project disruption in China continuing into the second quarter.We expect the lower sales from the COVID-19 impact in China will reduce our total global net sales growth by 1% to 2% for the year. We believe the China impact cannot be extrapolated to the overall impact for the rest of the company due to the reasons Lawrence already mentioned earlier.Differences related to lockdown durations and pantry stocking opportunities, as well as the different percentages of foodservice business and other dynamics in each region.We expect the shift in consumer consumption will continue with our consumer segment positively impacted by initial pantry stocking and followed by an increased preference for cooking at home.In our Flavor Solutions segment, we expect increased demand from our packaged food customers similar to our consumer segment. However, in the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions portfolio, which represents approximately 20% of our total company sales, we expect sharp declines in demand from our restaurants and other foodservice customers.Given the current economic environment, we are closely following the movements in foreign exchange rates and are anticipating a negative impact on our full year financial results.And finally, as Lawrence mentioned, we are moderating the pace of our ERP replacement program. As a result of this decision, we are projecting our program operating expenses in 2020 to be comparable to 2019.We continue to closely monitor the situation and expect to resume guidance during our second quarter earnings call at the end of June, when we should know more. We have managed through multiple business cycles for 130 years and have a consistent history of growth.We are well positioned, given our financial strength, stable cash generation, asset access to liquidity and have rapidly implemented appropriate mitigation plans. We are confident we will manage through the short term period of volatility and continue on our long-term growth trajectory.I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks, before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I\u2019d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 29. We delivered solid first quarter results, excluding the COVID-19 impact on China and recognize the balance of the year will be impacted by a broader challenging environment. We\u2019re effectively executing our strategies and are confident in our underlying foundation.We are responding to COVID-19 developments with agility and working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful.We have a consistent history of growth and very positive fundamentals in place to manage through this short term period of volatility and continue on our long-term growth trajectory. Our commitment to our long-term financial objectives has not changed. We are sustainably positioned for growth and will continue to deliver differentiated results.Now, let\u2019s turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And, obviously, I hope everyone and your families are safe and sound in crazy times.\nLawrence Kurzius: Right. Thank you, Ken. You too, Ken.\nKen Goldman: I wanted to just quickly ask, one, can you give us a little more clarity on maybe the quarter-to-date performance in both of your segments, even if just on a rough basis? And two, obviously, you do secure some of your products from areas of the world that are experiencing some challenges right now.Can you just walk us through a little bit, maybe, what you\u2019re doing to sort of secure your inputs? Maybe secure your supply chain a little bit beyond what you\u2019ve told us so far, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Ken. Great. Well, first of all, we\u2019re seeing all phases of the coronavirus crisis as a company, from the early phases of recovery in China through the new epicenters that we\u2019re all experiencing in the EMEA and in the US.We\u2019ve got - we are seeing the early stages of recovery in China, as we said in the prepared remarks. We can pretty well quantify that and we see a path forward there, and we\u2019ve given some outlook on that.In the Americas and EMEA, we\u2019re seeing very strong sales of retail products, as our others, especially in the Americas, it cuts across all channels on the - of the - our retail and consumer-oriented product, especially strong in e-commerce.We just actually got in a fresh scanner data this morning, ourselves. I mentioned a moment ago that we were up about 65% as a total company through the scanner for the most recent week that we had data for. We just got last week\u2019s information, and it\u2019s even stronger than that. It\u2019s nearly 90%, I\u2019d say.So it\u2019s a little over 89% for total company, through the U.S. - sorry, total company in the US, total consumer there. So really strong performance on that side, driven by the consumer pantry stocking behavior. And I think that you all probably got Nielsen data that covers the same time frame. That would be roughly consistent with that.And typically, our unmeasured channels are stronger than the measured channels, and I would expect that to be - you can - should expect that to be the same again.In our flavor solutions portion of our business, the portion of the business that\u2019s a little over 50% - that\u2019s over 50% that services the other CPG manufacturers is seeing an equally strong surge in demand. As those customers are having the same retail offtake and we\u2019re part of their supply chain, so we\u2019re experiencing that.The food service portion of the business goes the other way. And we\u2019ve tried to give some additional color on the size of our foodservice business in these remarks than we\u2019ve given in the past. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve previously really quantified how big our total away-from-home consumption exposure is.Between branded foodservice and the quick service restaurant industry, it\u2019s a little over 20%. Most of that runs through flavor solutions in China and India, that goes through the consumer segment because they share common distribution channels, common packs, and it\u2019s rolled up in that way.But in the food service, we\u2019re seeing a - in food service and QSR, we\u2019re seeing a sharp slowdown. We came into the month strong. But as we\u2019ve gone through the month, that has slowed significantly.Specifically saying in the EMEA, the QSR portion has come to a near halt, as the whole - as most of our customers have completely closed their restaurants. The difference between Europe and the US and in the US drive through a pickup has remained open. That\u2019s not the case in most of the major countries in Europe. And so that part of the business is going to have a strong impact.Oh, and you asked about supply chain. So let me take the second part of that. Our global sourcing organization has really been an advantage for us. We - and the experience that we had in China allowed us to see pretty early that we were going to need to do contingency planning. We started that very early on. We have actual people on the ground in the countries that we sort from, which has really been helpful in working with local authorities and local closures and restrictions.And in particular, working out transportation logistics, and we source over 14,000 raw materials from over 85 countries, in the world. We have - we\u2019re really well prepared for this, and I\u2019d say that, this has been a real area of advantage for us.We\u2019re currently not constrained on any production due to raw material or packaging shortage. We\u2019ve had some minor items. I mean, I could talk with you about a particular spec of anthel [ph] chilli that is needed for our Hispanic business here in the US, its cost about $3,000 worth of product. I mean, we\u2019re tracking it at that granular level. And I think that we\u2019re in a really good shape from a supply chain standpoint.\nKen Goldman: Very comprehensive. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi, there. Just two quick ones for me, if I could. In listening, Laurence, to your comments around the various portions of the business thus far, sort of through the quarter. Is it simply that it\u2019s still a bit too fluid and dynamic to sort of take those three big buckets, if you will the consumer piece, the part of flavor solutions that goes to packaged food manufacturers and then the pure food service side?I guess is it too early thinking through the quarter thus far to even suggest maybe how those things might balance out. I realize for the full year, that\u2019s probably a much tougher exercise.But even in thinking through the second quarter, just given some of the magnitude of some of the numbers on both ends of the spectrum. Even sort of directionally, is there a way to say that the two positives sort of outweigh the negative? Or do we still just really not have that level of clarity? And then, I just got a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah, for the year, of course, we - there\u2019s so much uncertainty on how this is going to unfold. I know others have given some guidance. Those have tended to be companies that are in their fourth quarter already. So they are basically giving you guidance for the next six weeks. We\u2019ve got a whole year ahead of us. This is just the end of our first quarter.We\u2019re one month into Q2. And the changes and shifts have been so dramatic over just the last couple of weeks that I think that we\u2019re not comfortable even - we don\u2019t normally give quarterly guidance, and we\u2019d be even less comfortable doing so right now.We really don\u2019t know the duration and the extent of the impact on the restaurant industry in particular. There are areas of the world that are still open for business. There are areas that are closed that could reopen. And we think that there\u2019s too much uncertainty for us to give you credible meaningful guidance right now on that.I will say that - I would expect that the restaurant industry impact will be pretty heavy in the second quarter. Again, the complete closure of restaurants in some areas, even though it\u2019s the minority of our business is going to be a drag that I think it\u2019s hard to see the consumer side overcoming in this particular quarter.\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah, understood. Thank you for that. And then just quickly on just the ERP spend, I think you said about the same amount of incremental spend this year, as last year. So I think initially, it was going to be - if I\u2019m not mistaken, an incremental $60 million of ERP spend this year and I think there was $20 million last year. So basically, we\u2019re saying there\u2019s now an incremental $20 million this year instead of $60 million? Thank you very much.\nMichael Smith: Hey, Andrew. It\u2019s Mike. You\u2019re correct. We spent around $20 million last year in 2019, and we\u2019re going to spend around $20 million this year in 2020. So it\u2019s not incremental. It\u2019s at the same as comparable between the fiscal years.\nLawrence Kurzius: I just want to elaborate on it. We are pausing the ERP program, but we are committed to our long-term success. And as a company, we take a long-term view of our program. So we\u2019re investing behind our employees right now. We\u2019re continuing to invest in brand marketing and it\u2019s our intent to continue the ERP program.So we do have a team that will continue to work on it through the year and we would expect to - that the go-lives that we were planning are going to slide out 12 months or so and be back.And right now, there are two drivers for a decision to postpone it. One is, just the executional reality. Our pilots for - one of our pilots was in Italy, for example, and it has become as an executional matter impossible to do that pilot and the other pilot is also in an area where because of travel restrictions, it just wasn\u2019t possible to do the training and work that it takes to actually bring the system up. And with no pilots there, no go-lives. And so from an executional standpoint, sheer practicality required us to push the program out.And then secondly, as we have prioritized keeping our brands and our customers brands in supply and maintaining business continuity the resources that we\u2019re going into the program were better spent right now on the urgent needs and adapting to the rapidly changing supply requirements.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you. Stay well, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Good morning. So I wanted to talk a little bit about your commercial initiatives in the consumer segment. You had talked about how there have been some changes. I know we were talking about shelf resets at CAGNY. So just wanted to get more color around how those are changing, just given what\u2019s happening because of COVID, especially in the US?\nLawrence Kurzius: You bet. So Faiza, we\u2019ve changed - well, first of all, we\u2019ve continued to deliver the brand marketing that we had planned to, but some of the messaging and the vehicles that we\u2019re using have shifted. This is part of the advantage of having our in-house marketing excellence organization, we\u2019re able to change - produce new content and change the content very rapidly. And so we made the message a bit more relevant. I gave some examples in our prepared remarks. And I think that has had a good impact.We\u2019ve resourced up an area where consumers can write in and get real-time answers to their questions. That\u2019s a somewhat people-intensive thing, but it\u2019s been very much appreciated by consumers.The new products that we talked about at CAGNY were already largely being launched. And so while retailers have focused more on core items as they have scrambled to keep their shelf stock. We had a lot of placement on those items and a lot of acceptance on those items already.And although we didn\u2019t talk about our second half new items at CAGNY, our R&D teams have continued to work on it. Our commercial teams - commercialization teams have continued to work on those. And I would expect - you should expect to see a reasonable pipeline of new products in the second half of the year as well.The shelf reset that we talked about also was already underway. And so the picture, for example, that I used at CAGNY was in an actual store. It was not some kind of a retail lab, but it was an actual store installation. We have a number of them up.Right now those installations have stop, because of the immediate demand at retail and everybody trying to minimize extra people in the store. But as all these shelter-in-place rules and so on get lifted and things hopefully return to normal in the second half of the year, we would expect that to remain.We didn\u2019t quantify how many stores. We said we would have. I think I said at CAGNY that we would have thousands of them though. We still expect to have thousands, but fewer than we would have thought at CAGNY.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Alexia. Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. Can I ask about the behavioral changes that you\u2019re seeing? You talked about people cooking from scratch more. Do you have any channel data to show how many more meals people are cooking at home versus eating out or what have you?And then similarly on the behavioral change on e-commerce side, some obviously very impressive growth there. Do you have any data on how many of those - how much of that lift is driven by new sign-ups, people trying it for the first time versus existing consumers? And how profitable is that channel these days for you? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Okay. I\u2019m not sure I get the answers to the exact questions that you\u2019re asking, but I do know that we - that the consumer behavioral changes that we\u2019re seeing are significant. And rather than thinking of panel data, we actually have - we\u2019re actually doing our own real-time consumer tracking. And so we have our own data that shows how behaviors are unfolding. There is definitely an interest in cooking at home more kind of around comfort foods, a little bit around the same trends that - some of the trends that we have talked about previously or actually - are just magnified or accelerated, so shopping online, some more adventurous cooking. Mike, do you want to add.\nMichael Smith: Yeah, I think - and we\u2019re doing a lot of our research, even with our employees. One of the questions - one of the comments we had back from employees are snacking a lot more at home because they\u2019re home working and the snacks are right there.So pushing a huge lift in both cooking activities and everything food is people being adventures them, too. They\u2019re trying to use what\u2019s in their pantry, jazz it up a bit, and we\u2019ve seen very strong sales of a lot of exotic spices and flavoring.\nAlexia Howard: And then as a quick follow-up. On the flexibility of your manufacturing, in the food service production be re-tooled to make more on the consumer side of the business? Or is it going to be quite challenging to maybe have a sustained period where the restaurant channel is down, the retail sales are up?Are you worried that sustaining this kind of level of growth or not - maybe not this kind of level of growth, but after the pantry loading finishes, having that, sort of, switch? Is that a challenge for you or is that fairly easy to manage? Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah, Alexia, it\u2019s a great question. Most of our facilities make products for both segments of our business. And so we can move resources within those facilities. Some of the foodservice items are being repurposed to the club store channel right now as well. And so we\u2019re able to do that. And even beyond the manufacturing facilities, we were able to move our people to focus in on the right area. So we have a lot of flexibility on that.There are a couple of exceptions. We do have one manufacturing facility in Europe that is heavily dedicated to sauces for the QSR and food service industry. And demand is very, very slow there, and it\u2019s difficult to repurpose that. But generally speaking, we\u2019ve got 118 facilities around the world. We have 49 production plants. They are all able to operate, and we\u2019re able to shift volume around to meet the current demand.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much, and stay safe everyone. Great to work with you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Alexia.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Strycula: Hi, good morning. And it\u2019s great to hear that McCormick has taken the long view here, not surprising and taking care of its employees and stakeholders during these volatile times, so much appreciated.So question - two part question. First one would be a consumer behavioral question. Lawrence, you\u2019re keen to point out that right now we\u2019re going through phase one, maybe where consumers are pantry loading, but ultimately, well people are behaviorally at home more, they should be cooking more.So can you walk us through what you would expect oversimplified model as to how we maybe migrate through on the consumer piece over the next few months? Some investors are asking, do we go through a big pantry load period that\u2019s followed by subsequent de-load or just be the spike and then it moderates to a better baseline growth level? If you could just help us understand that curve?\nLawrence Kurzius: Actually, we lean towards the latter few. This pantry stocking behavior, obviously, is a one-time surge that isn\u2019t sustainable. But there is real incremental consumption that\u2019s happening. The kids are staying - are in from school. People are trying to stay close to home, either voluntarily or by government order.And people, as a result are getting used to the idea of cooking at home and are learning new cooking behaviors. We\u2019re - our demand for recipes and how to videos on our digital properties is absolutely through the roof. The kind of questions we\u2019re getting for our real-time response is all about cooking tips and how to prepare and what to prepare. And we think that there is going to be a sustained shift for a period of time to more at home cooking, which in the past has been a net benefit to us.The other thing I don\u2019t want to miss is that kind of the after - however, the COVID-19 situation plays out, it\u2019s likely we\u2019re going to be followed by a recessionary period as well. Historically, we\u2019ve performed well during the recessionary period. Consumers tend to do cook more at home. And they\u2019re cutting back in other areas, they tend to reward themselves a little bit with the foods that they consume at home.And our historical track record, just looking back at the 2001 and the 2008, \u201809 time period, we\u2019ve had strong growth in our consumer business. That\u2019s been a positive for us overall as a company.\nSteve Strycula: I appreciate that. And as of Marylander, I\u2019m rewarding myself with some Old Bay Hot Sauce, which is very\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: Great, it\u2019s awesome.\nSteve Strycula: One quick question for Mike, and then I\u2019ll pass it along. To follow-up with Andrew Lazar\u2019s question on the ERP spend, I appreciate given the servicing rates to the customers right now as a priority and that might postpone the SAP implementation upgrade.But should we think about that $60 million of incrementality, therefore kind of shifting into fiscal \u201821 and what was earmarked for fiscal 2021 kind of shifts into fiscal 2022. So basically, the whole Wave series goes over by a year.I know it\u2019s difficult to comment on right now, but any high level would be commentary would be appreciated. Thank you.\nMichael Smith: No, Steve, just like we\u2019re not giving second quarter guidance or 2020 guidance, we\u2019re not going to give 2021 or \u201822. I mean, there will be some type of shift. We just - it\u2019s really too early. We need to re-plan this project, work around our manufacturing busy seasons and things like that. So yeah, I hesitate, but I can\u2019t give you really any guidance there.\nLawrence Kurzius: And there\u2019s some expense and work has been done this year, which contributes to it also. So the shape of it will likely be different.\nSteve Strycula: Understood. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. A lot of people are trying to think through the cost to execute all of these increases in manufacturing capacity, the higher labor costs. I mean, if you\u2019d ask me though, you know, what\u2019s the net benefit here of producing SKUs that are really popular and long production runs, I would argue that, that would offset higher cost for labor. Is there any way you can walk us through the pros and - the nets and negatives of that or positives and negatives of that?And then secondly, promotional price discounts. I mean, does McCormick still need to have promotional price points at retail in this environment?\nMichael Smith: Yeah. Part of that is hard to answer and goes to the uncertainty that makes us not want to give guidance at this time. And that there are puts and takes and they\u2019re changing so fast that I don\u2019t know that we can give - we\u2019re not 100% - we\u2019re not sure enough on how those balance out.Your point is well taken. By a longer run, more core items that that\u2019s a very efficient way to run our manufacturing facilities. There are also a lot of extra costs related to expediting at over time - over time, definitely. We just announced that we are paying premium wages to the people who come to work. We haven\u2019t talked about it, but we\u2019re doing, I think, temperature scans at all the entrances to facilities, which has a cost. And so we\u2019re - I\u2019d say that right now, there\u2019s some uncertainty about how those are going to balance out that we will sort through.If we were maybe two more weeks into it, we have a better handle on it, but these are things that are literally changing day-by-day. So, things like transportation, fuel rates are down, you see that at the gas pump. But some shipping rates are up too. So we\u2019re just too early at this point.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Ask a follow-up, Easter, you typically have a lot of seasonals that go into market for Easter. Is that still going to happen? Or are retailers shifting merchandising away from Easter?\nLawrence Kurzius: You asked about promotions, and so this kind of goes to that. So we are running fewer promotions. I think we might have had that in our prepared - my prepared comments and that\u2019s really in collaboration with our customers who, frankly, are having a hard time executing against those.That\u2019s probably going to add some impact on Easter, but I think that whatever impact there is on Easter, it\u2019s going to be lost in the shuffle because of the tremendous surge right now. We are seeing the right seasonal items doing strongly in vanilla for baking a big item right now.Easter is a less important holiday for McCormick. We often talk about Easter because you\u2019ve got to get the Easter displays down to get the grilling displays up. And the grilling season starts after Easter, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s the bigger factor for us is getting the grilling items out there. And honestly, with people staying at home more, we actually expect our grilling season to be really good.\nRobert Moskow: Great. All right. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jeffries. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thank you so much. Hope everyone\u2019s well. So look, I know you said kind of that week ending March 15th, vanilla was up. I think you said there was 50% plus. Obviously, people at home cooking more, eat vanilla. How do you think - your first question is just about destock potential, right? There\u2019s a lot of questions around is this a consumption shift or is there really a pantry load, just in general?And then secondly, just on the margin, I know there\u2019s no guidance, but with respect to Q1, the flavor solutions segment actually had decent op margin. And then I think kind of going forward, you hopefully would get some volume leverage lift.But maybe given kind of that shift in flavor solutions on the foodservice side, is there an offset? Or just kind of like some structural framework how we can think about that, that, yeah, maybe there could be some benefits on the consumer side, but we\u2019re not sure and kind of the same goes for flavor solutions? Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. On the pantry stock, I think that there\u2019s real incremental consumption and it\u2019s not going to be something that\u2019s going to have to be de-loaded. We\u2019re talking about spices used to - spices, seasoning, condiments used to \u2013 if you look to recipe mixes used to cook meals at home, and there is more food consumption happening at home.Consumers really are eating this up. It\u2019s not like toilet paper where at some time, there\u2019s going to - there\u2019d be such a glut on the market that it\u2019s going to freeze up. There\u2019s real incremental usage here that we think is not going to require any kind of consumer pantry unloading, at least as near as we can measure at this time. And I\u2019d say that that would probably play into the uncertainty about it, but we have a point of view on it.\nMichael Smith: I think on the - your question about kind of the structural margin, you are right, we had a really great first quarter from a margin perspective at the gross margin line flavor solutions. We continue the portfolio migration. Our CCI teams have done a great job, and we\u2019ll continue to do a great job during this crisis.We have a lot of volume favorabilities. The problem is going forward, Rob, if some of the volume drops off, some of those go away from an overhead absorption perspective, so you can\u2019t really count on those to continue. But obviously, we\u2019ll give you more guidance as we can.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Sure. And then just a quick follow-up, I think I heard you say earlier that maybe the pressure so far from your perspective, you see coming through March and that 20% of the business in food service restaurants and flavor solutions could be maybe a little bit more pronounced than consumer might be able to offset. So I just want to clarify that comment, just given that piece is 20% and the other piece of the business\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: Rob, I also want to - so I want to remind you that, China was largely on lockdown through most of the month of March. And so there\u2019s going to be a pretty - there\u2019s going to be a significant impact from China. They are in recovery now. But Hubei province actually just reopening now, and so - for example, so there is going to be an impact from that as well.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. So it sounds like that 1% to 2% expected pressure on China for the year is really, at this point more of a Q2 event?\nLawrence Kurzius: I\u2019d say, mostly a first half of it.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you so much. Stay safe.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Thank you. Appreciate you guys squeezing me in today. First, coming back, it\u2019s an earlier question from a different line. Just thinking about trade marketing in the current - in the current period, I know, Lawrence, you talked about promotions generally, but just trade spend generally.I mean, how does that evolve when it seems almost indiscriminate what the consumer is taking? And as long as - if you have it on the shelf in the center of the store, it seems like people are buying it. Just how does that become part of the margin kind of earnings equation over the balance of the year?\nLawrence Kurzius: Right. I wish it was that easy. But I think a lot of what - I mean, right now, I mean, trade marketing is really about customer support and working with our customers collaboratively to keep them in supply with the items that are selling the fastest.And so the reason that there\u2019s a reduction in promotion activity is frankly, the customers can\u2019t keep up with it, and so you stop. So there\u2019s - so we shouldn\u2019t have stopped. So we have curtailed some promotions.It\u2019s hard to see how that is kind of to play out as we go through the year, I think that we\u2019re just going through an extraordinary period right now that will reach a new equilibrium, and we\u2019ll be able to continue with the promotional activity that\u2019s meaningful with our customer.\nMichael Smith: And as more consumers really go online to digital \u2013 and we\u2019ve been migrating our trade spend to digital for the last couple of years. So you\u2019ll see more of that there.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a second question, just on the pantry stock that\u2019s been happening, I mean, your portfolio, I maintenance, a pretty complex kind of assortment of SKUs that have kind of different kind of consumption patterns and kind of normal sales velocity.And just from the data you\u2019ve seen, have you been surprised that the sales velocity of things that normally wouldn\u2019t turn fast? Or just, I guess, some of your things I would think can stay in the pantry for some time. Are you seeing bigger uplift in those items where it could take longer to get that restock again in several months or the faster turning SKUs returning even faster?\nLawrence Kurzius: I think that the extent of the consumer pantry stocking and the suddenness with which it hit is a surprise to everyone. But in terms of you know, when you piece it apart and you look at orders of magnitude, the items with the highest velocities are not a surprise. They\u2019re recipe mix. It\u2019s our condiments.Frank\u2019s RedHot Sauce, frankly, these items are not items that are stockpiled, but that tend to be consumed pretty quickly. And that are the ones that are seeing some of the biggest increases.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nChris Growe: I\u2019m glad you all are doing well and safe. So just two questions, if I could. The first would be, I want to understand, as we think about the restaurant business overall, the area that\u2019s being pressured the most, is that a higher margin business overall?In particular, I\u2019m curious in China, there was a larger profit effect from that the softness in that business. I just want to get my head around the size of profitability there, even in general terms.And then I had a second question just on the US, I know you had a bit of an increase in inventory in the first quarter last year, obviously, that compares to this year. Where do inventory stand now building in this environment. I just want to understand how that could play out going forward and how to expect that to influence your business? Thank you.\nMichael Smith: Hey, Chris. This is Mike. If you remember the flavor wheel, we show the flavor solutions breakout, where we have about 45% of our flavor solutions businesses in flavors. That\u2019s generally the higher margin business, and we talked about portfolio migration more to that.Custom condiments, coatings, ingredients, generally lower margin business. We have talked to some really good margin in there, so I don\u2019t want to characterize the whole group. But it\u2019s generally lower than the flavor side of the business.Specifically talking about China, I mean, China is a very developed market for us. We have scale there. We have large manufacturing facilities, lots of people. So the margins there are generally good across consumer and flavor solutions. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a pretty significant impact in Q1 from a profit perspective.\nLawrence Kurzius: And going forward, the wheel that Mike was talking about, the branded foodservice component has margins that are comparable to our consumer business. So there\u2019s a mix of margin structures within that. There\u2019s the branded food service with consumer-like margins and there\u2019s a quick service restaurant piece, which is part of the business that we generally characterize as low margin.\nMichael Smith: There was a second part of your question. Chris, what was it?\nChris Growe: Yes, it was just on the inventory changes, and we are going either down or up in the first quarter last year, therefore, a tough comp, but how to think about those going forward? That seems like they should grow from here would seem?\nMichael Smith: Yeah, you would think - I mean, I think customers are trying to grow their inventories right now. I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re being successful. I mean, if you walk into any store you\u2019re going to see, they don\u2019t have stock on their shelves in a lot of areas.It\u2019s hard to - I don\u2019t know where that is going to stabilize. I\u2019d say right now, I don\u2019t think anyone in the - a retail or customer side is thinking about inventory reduction. I think right now they\u2019re scrambling to stay in stock.\nChris Growe: And to that point then, Lawrence, are you shipping ahead of consumption then? Just from a broad - I\u2019m not trying to get an exact number, but understand the degree to which you\u2019re able to ship now. Can you ship ahead of consumption then?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah, I can\u2019t really - I would really be speculating on that. We are - I would say we are keeping up with the demand. It is challenging right now to keep up with that demand.And I would say that if we had not been as well prepared as we were on the supply chain side and also, frankly, building some inventory in preparation for our ERP shift that - which might echoes down all the way through our supply chain, we would really - we\u2019d be even more stressed than we are right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Really appreciate you guys getting me in, and I understand the time here. So just some follow ups, and I hope these are enhancive. The first question, I don\u2019t think you said what the magnitude of the decline in the foodservice business, the 20% of the company in March, but can you?I appreciate the positive numbers on the consumer side, but just trying to get a sense of this 20% of foodservice business. Do you have a sense of what the magnitude of the decline is in March?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, exactly, definitely not said what it was and you know we\u2019re not going to say more than it\u2019s significant. It is a fast changing situation. Restaurant openings and closures are being announced almost daily. And I think that it\u2019s - I think that we\u2019re really not in a position to give you or your colleague\u2019s meaningful credible guidance in this area right now.\nMichael Smith: What we can say, it\u2019s different in different regions with the world, like we said before, EMEA has seen a significant downturn because of the government actions without shutting down everything.\nDavid Driscoll: Okay. And then just two other quick follow-ups. Mike, can you just talk about the CCI program in an environment like this? Does it even unfold over the rest of the year as you originally thought it would?I mean, can you execute these programs? Or given the demand that you have going on, do you just re-task your people to making sure that you got product going out the door? I don\u2019t really understand how to think through this. So any thoughts you give right there are of big help.And then last question I had for you guys was just new products versus the big SKUs You\u2019ve kind of talked around this a little bit. But just directly, are you reducing your focus on some of the new products and increasing your focus on your big SKUs in terms of your manufacturing runs? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys.\nMichael Smith: Hey, Dave. This is Mike. CCI, good question. CCI has been a long-term program for us since 2009. We have a really strong pipeline of projects coming into this year and it\u2019s ingrained in our culture. We have teams still working on CCI programs.You\u2019re right though, it puts a lot of stress on the organization competing priorities. But that is not any - that\u2019s not a factor in any withdrawal of our guidance. We still feel confident about our CCI program.Again, in the second quarter, and we always say this too shall pass to some degree. And hopefully, things get back to the new normal, but we still feel real confident in our CCI program and achieving those results.\nLawrence Kurzius: And likewise on NPD, I\u2019ve already commented on the first quarter, so I won\u2019t repeat the - sorry, first half, and I won\u2019t repeat that. But again, as we take a long-term perspective on our business, our R&D teams and our marketing teams and commercialization teams are continuing to work on NPD. And we have a good pipeline. Again this will pass and there\u2019ll be - there\u2019s going to be an important place for new products just as always has been.\nDavid Driscoll: Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning and thank you for fitting me in. Lawrence, I just wanted to ask about kind of squaring some of the math around China. Obviously, a 3% hit kind of in the first quarter and then 1.5% or 1% to 2% kind of hit for the full year, would sort of imply a similar $35 million to $40 million hit in the second quarter? I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about that right.And I know you\u2019ve also just given some early commentary, but anything you\u2019re hearing from your foodservice customers in China on the ground, maybe outside of the Hubei province would be helpful.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. So I think that your math is right. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s all second quarter, but we do see a ramping up of the business, but a strong impact in the second quarter. And that you\u2019re in the right order of magnitude there in terms of the impact that we expect.Regarding the food service industry in China, most of our customers have gone - have publicly stated that their restaurants are open and they are. And consumer traffic is slowly building. That opening has occurred over a period of weeks, but our teams would confirm that the restaurants are open.And they are depending on the region, some of the areas where recovery is furthest along like in Shanghai. And they\u2019re seeing 30% or as much as 50%. Normal traffic in places like Hubei, you know, the openings are only - they are only like a few days or weeks into them and consumers are still not confident enough or have the freedom of movement to get into those restaurants.Hope that gives you some good color. We\u2019ve got almost 3,000 people in China, including 1,000 in Wuhan. So, we have a pretty good pulse of what\u2019s actually happening on the ground there.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. No, that\u2019s very helpful. You also gave some helpful commentary just around McCormick\u2019s broader performance during recessionary periods. I think one of the questions that we\u2019ve been getting is just in general what kind of happens with private label in a recessionary period.So just anything you could speak to that, what you saw kind of in 2001 and maybe in 2009 in some of your categories with competition from private label?\nLawrence Kurzius: Our experience is that we\u2019ve done well during those recessionary times. I don\u2019t want you to forget that we\u2019re a supplier of private label. And both - private label does well, so do our brands, and we\u2019ve had good growth.We, again, look back at the last two recessionary periods, and our consumer business growth was strong. I think we mentioned those numbers in the prepared remarks. I\u2019d say that our US consumer business was actually slightly stronger than the numbers that we quoted for total company.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks, everyone for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. And thank you for your patience for staying over. We did want to take all of the questions. And so, we\u2019ve run a little bit long. McCormick is a leader in flavor, and we\u2019re differentiated with a broad and advantaged portfolio, which continues to drive growth. We have growing and profitable business and operate in an environment that is changing at an ever faster pace. We deliver flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in the industry and the world with new ideas, innovation and purpose.One of the most significant risks to any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We are all experiencing that disruption now, and McCormick is well prepared, not only to manage through it, but to emerge stronger.With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we are confident our strategies will enable us to become even better positioned to drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to everyone for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions regarding today\u2019s information, please reach out to me. This concludes the call this morning. Have a good day and hope everyone stays healthy and safe.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. To start, I'd like to comment on the extraordinary and continually evolving global impact of COVID-19. On behalf of everyone at McCormick, I'd like to first express our deepest sympathies to all those who are affected by COVID-19 and thank those working to keep people safe through this crisis.McCormick is committed to maintaining critical food supply across all our markets and supporting our communities. We are working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful.We have three priorities while navigating through this period of volatility and uncertainty. First, to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the quality and integrity of our product.Second, to keep our brands and our customers brands and supply and maintain the financial strength of our business. Our third priority is to ensure McCormick emerges strong from this event. It will come to an end. We will come out a better company by driving our long-term strategies responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength.We're taking steps to safely operate our business and supply our customers. We continue to operate our supply chain without significant disruption. We have implemented contingency planning with most employees working remotely where possible.We have global and regional crisis teams in place, continually monitoring the rapidly evolving situation and recommending risk mitigation actions. And we've implemented travel restrictions, visitor protocols and social distancing practices, as you would expect.We've also recently announced incentives to further recognize and support employees who work on-site in locations critical to keeping our operations running globally. We will increase hourly wages, further extend sick leave to support family members and maintain salaries if operations are suspended. It's essential that we show our appreciation to employees, while doing our part for the betterment of public health and to support our communities.And moving to slide five, to highlight a few points on the current conditions we're seeing and the potential impact. First, as we mentioned at CAGNY, the significant disruption in China's consumption in the first quarter impacted our results.The events in China during the second half of the quarter were extraordinary. While total McCormick sales follow a seasonal pattern with the first quarter generally the lightest, the first quarter is typically our peak season in China.Additionally, over half our China business relates to away-from-home consumption. And Hubei province is one of our most highly developed regions due to the DaQiao brand being founded and made in Wuhan. This made the China lockdown with an extended lockdown in Hubei, coupled with no opportunity for consumers to stock their pantries to be a significant impact.We believe we cannot use the China results to extrapolate the overall impact for the rest of the company due to differences related to lockdown durations, pantry stocking opportunities, as well as the different percentages of foodservice business and other dynamics in each region.The disruption in China resulted in a 3% reduction in total company first quarter sales and reduced our total consumer and flavor solutions segment sales 5% and 1%, respectively.As a reminder, in China, our Consumer segment includes the branded foodservice component, because those foodservice products use the same packaging format and share a common distribution channel, particularly in traditional trade and in the smaller markets as other consumer products in China.The lower operating income from China impacted the total company's growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by 10%. Currently, during the early stages of recovery in China, we are seeing increased cooking at home and a surge in consumer retail demand, both in stores, as well as through e-commerce and the start of a recovery in foodservice as most restaurants and caterers reopen and consumer confidence gradually builds.We expect China's results to be significantly impacted in the second quarter, as well as the market begins to recover gradually. The lockdown in Hubei continued through March and as recently announced is expected to be lifted in April.For the year, we expect lower China sales from the COVID-19 impact will reduce our total net sales growth by 1% to 2%. And as I already mentioned, we currently believe COVID-19 impact in China cannot be extrapolated to the overall COVID-19 impact for the rest of the company.Turning to the current status of our major markets outside of China, our presence in China afforded us the insight of seeing how COVID-19 scenarios can unfold, as well as to take early action.Our supply chain business continuity plans have been in effect since January. We have assessed and implemented continuity plans to provide customers with continued supply. To-date, there has been no material impact on supply for most of our sourced materials and for those impacted continuity plans have been activated.We are partnering with our customers to monitor and respond to changes in consumer demand. We're seeing increased consumer consumption both through our scanner data and e-commerce, as well as through customer orders, including those from packaged food companies in our flavor solutions segment.While this increase is impacted by short term pantry stocking, we expect some level of elevated demand for at home cooking to continue. Schools are closed, people are staying at home, and that contributes to real incremental at home consumption.We also know from our sales performance during recessionary periods, we benefit from consumers eating at home. Our constant currency total consumer segment organic sales growth in 2001 and 2009 was 4% and 3% respectively.On the other hand, in the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions segment, which represents approximately 20% of our total company sales, we are now seeing reduced demand from our foodservice customers as COVID-19 measures have eliminated in dine-in services and limited restaurants to carry out our delivery-only. We expect this will have a significant negative impact on our near term performance, particularly in our EMEA region, as more people stay at home and away-from-home options remain limited.To maximize flexibility during this uncertain time, we've decided to moderate the pace of our enterprise resource planning or ERP replacement program. While we remain excited about and committed to our global transformation initiative, we believe that it is more prudent given current challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation to re-phase the timing of this initiative as we focus on the three priorities that I previously described.Now I'd like to focus on our first quarter results, highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segment and finally, our growth drivers in relation to the current environment.Turning on slide seven. In our first quarter, the lower operating results from the COVID-19 impact in China, I just mentioned, offset the otherwise solid sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth we delivered, driven by the successful execution of our strategy and engagement of employees. This while also making business transformation investments.We have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, which continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business. Across our portfolio, in our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA region, we drove particularly strong flavor solutions sales growth in the first quarter.In our Asia Pacific region, the China disruption significantly affected our first quarter sales growth across both segments of our - across both of our segments with a greater impact in consumer. Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio will continue to be the foundation for sales growth. And while we may experience temporary disruptions in parts of our business, we're confident that underlying consumer demand will continue to underpin long-term growth.Now let me cover the highlights of our first quarter performance. Starting with our topline for the first quarter versus the year ago period, total sales declined 2%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from currency and a 3% unfavorable impact from China, partly offset by 2% growth contributed by the rest of the business, driven by higher volumes and product mix, as well as pricing.Adjusted operating income was down 2%, with minimal impact from currency and included a 10% unfavorable impact from China results. Partly offsetting this impact was the sales growth across the rest of the business and savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program, CCI.During the quarter, we also had higher brand marketing and ERP replacement program investments compared to last year. At the bottom line, our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was lower than $1.12 in the prior period or decline of 4%. This decline includes a 10% unfavorable operating impact from China and a 5% headwind due to a higher adjusted tax rate.As we said on our year-end earnings call in January and at CAGNY in February, we have confidence in our strategies and notwithstanding the COVID-19 impact, our underlying foundation is strong, and we remain committed to our long-term growth objectives.Now, let me spend a few minutes on our business updates. Starting on slide eight with our consumer segment. Constant currency sales declined 6% in the first quarter, including an unfavorable 5% China impact.The America constant currency sales declined 2%. We believe we substantially undershipped consumer consumption due to normal seasonal trade inventory reductions versus building some inventory levels in the first quarter of 2019. We estimate this resulted in a negative 4% impact to the Americas growth for the quarter.This is in line with our expected trade inventory impact to net sales for the year, which is also consistent with our historical performance. Today, it's hard to comprehend that there were retailers reducing inventory in the first quarter, the world has changed so much.In US spices and seasonings, we are maintaining the share stabilization we achieved last year. Our IRI data indicates US McCormick branded spices and seasoning scanner sales grew in line with the category and we had strong growth in unmeasured channels, particularly in e-commerce. We believe for the combined channels, McCormick branded slightly outpaced the spices and seasonings category growth. In McCormick branded dry recipe mixes, we continued our growth momentum, delivering share growth for the 10th straight quarter.Our first quarter performance included our sixth sequential quarter of accelerating consumption growth across our condiment portfolio. In total, we grew consumption 4%, as well as growing share in many of our product lines.Frank's RedHot Sauce had strong performance again, partially driven by effective Super Bowl marketing and promotion programs. Stubb's Barbecue and McCormick Manasive grew double-digits, and French's Mustard continued its consumption and share growth momentum.Our category management initiatives, effective marketing support and merchandising execution, expanded distribution and new products are all contributing to driving our category leadership and our momentum. We're confident in our initiatives underway to continue our long-term growth trajectory.In March, we're seeing an unprecedented surge in demand from customers and consumers at the worst [ph] the single-digit changes we're discussing related to our first quarter results and I'll say more about this in a moment.Now turning to the EMEA region. We had growth in UK and France, driven partially by new products and brand marketing support. New dry recipe mix products, such as the launch of our One Pan line, contributed to us not only gaining share in the quarter, but also to have the leading UK recipe mix position.In the Asia, Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined, driven by the significant impact in China, as I previously mentioned. In other parts of the region, we continued to gain momentum with effective brand marketing and promotions, as well as through e-commerce. Our fundamentals in our consumer business remain strong.Turning to slide nine in our Flavor Solutions segment, our performance was excellent, with constant currency sales growth of 5%, driven by the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by the decline in the Asia, Pacific region.In Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 5%. We had broad-based growth across our portfolio, both through our product category and customer perspective. Strong growth to both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants was driven by new products and base business growth.Our momentum in branded foodservice continued with robust growth, driven by new products such as Old Bay Hot Sauce, promotional activity with operators and expanded distribution.In addition to driving top line growth, we also continue to migrate our portfolio to more value-added categories. Our sales growth in EMEA was outstanding, 9% in constant currency as the strong momentum we have built in this region continued into the first quarter.We are winning with our customers both quick service restaurant and packaged food companies through new products, their promotional activities and expanded distribution.In the Asia, Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined, driven by the significant impact of China, in other parts of the region, sales to quick service restaurants drove growth.Turning to slide 10 to talk about our growth drivers in the current environment. Just six weeks ago at CAGNY, we shared with you our 2020 growth plan aligned to our strategy designed to build long-term value for our shareholders.We are now operating in a more dynamic and rapidly changing environment and were at CAGNY and possibly ever before and need to be agile in responding to the current dynamics and the changing consumer behaviors.Our overall growth plans have not changed, although some have been adjusted and even strengthened to enable us to effectively execute in these challenging times and the balance of the year and to capitalize on the opportunity to help our consumers and our customers through this difficult time.First, across both segments, we are currently focused on keeping our brands and our customer brands and supply, feeding particularly strong demand for items in key categories for spices and herbs, seasoning blends providing flavor solutions, dry recipe mixes, offering convenience, condiments, rice [ph] mixes, frozen products, stocks and broth and snack seasonings. The continuity of meeting demand, including the quality and integrity of our product is a critical priority.Turning specifically to our consumer segment, our 2020 plan includes to further drive our undisputed leadership in spice and seasonings, accelerate our condiment global platform, and fuel our growth at emerging markets and channels, as well as an on-trend, fast-growing platform.We're strengthening our connection with the consumer, especially with digital, e-commerce and social media outreach, which is even more important today with consumers at home more and looking for solutions. Simply put, our consumer portfolio and plans are even more relevant today than they were before.We are seeing an incredible surge in demand from consumers stocking their pantries and cooking at home, as our other consumer packaged companies. For example, for the week ended March 15th, scanner sales for the total McCormick US branded portfolio grew 65%, with all major categories up double or triple digits. While we expect consumption will not continue at this extraordinary level, we do expect sustained growth from an increase in consumers cooking at home.Now, taking a deeper look at our plans. Brand marketing is a key driver of sales growth and we're increasing our investments in 2020 as planned. The speed and agility we gained with our marketing excellence organization has enabled us to quickly pivot and adjust our messaging in light of the COVID-19 developments.For instance, we've changed content to focus on at home family times which is more relevant than the current environment. A few weeks ago, we launched our new US McCormick brand advertising campaign with the tagline; It's Gonna Be Great, which is the strongest going campaign in our consumer testing history.This TV and digital campaign is focused on consumer education on what to make, how to prepare, and build confidence in the kitchen, which is all the more relevant today as consumers cook more at home.Our plans to create even deeper connections with our consumers by bridging their physical and digital experiences have been underway since early this year. We continue to develop best-in-class content and opportunities for our consumers to connect with us and are strengthening our brand as an indispensable partner on their flavor journey. These opportunities have now increased and even go beyond their flavor journey.Consumer engagement with our McCormick properties, such as mccormick.com, YouTube, and our social channels has increased high double-digits in recent weeks, both in visits and time spent. And we have a steady stream of new real-time content that is focused on solutions to the questions consumers are asking.Here are some examples. How to occupy the kids at home? Of course, with kid-friendly recipes from painted sugar cookies to scented slime or window clings, and we're seeing increased consumption in related product. US scanner sales shown vanilla is up 54% for example, in the weekend of March 15th.While recipes and products help with health and wellness, our content and recipes on turmeric and bone broth, as well as soup recipes, for example, have increased and we're continuing our work to promote the health benefits of spices and herbs. Our U S consumption growth on our stocks and broth was up 140% and turmeric up 22% during the same period.How to create flavorful meals with items that have been stockpiled? Cantuna eggs and pasta are frequent searches, and we have and will continue to create content to add flavor to these items and more. Consumers want more convenient solutions to add flavor, as evidenced by recent 104% U.S. consumption growth in dry recipe mixes.And finally, consumers can now use our newly added ask McCormick feature on our social channel, where we respond real-time with tips, tricks, recipes and products. We are now there with whatever consumers need to help them through these times.The investments we've made in e-commerce have not only driven growth, but positioned us well for acceleration, which is what we're experiencing and for which we are prepared. Consumer shopping behavior is changing and the opportunities we're activating by making all touch points shoppable are paying off.In China, traffic to our direct-to-consumer platform has increased four times, driving sales growth up triple digits, increasing fivefold since the beginning of the year. In the US, we're seeing increased traffic and sales as well. Our pure-play and direct-to-consumer sales have tripled in recent weeks. This is also true in EMEA, with direct-to-consumer sales tripling as well. We're making our products even more discoverable to consumers with increased support.Our exciting first half new product launches, align with consumers demands for convenience, health and transparency, as well as flavor exploration and experimentation. We continue to drive category leadership and in the US, our enthusiastic and committed about our initiative underway to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasoning.By introducing new merchandising elements, we have had strong favorable customer reaction and began the rollout earlier this year. As we partner with retailers to maintain stock shelves and business continuity, we will have some delay in our rollout plan. With increased cooking at home expected to be a longer term trend, this initiative becomes even more exciting and relevant.Now, turning to our Flavor Solution segment. Our immediate focus is on responding to the volatility we're seeing across the segment. As a reminder, in flavor solutions, we operate across a wide range of customers and channels, consumer manufacturers, restaurants and distributors.Over 50% of our flavor solutions portfolio are flavors and ingredient product categories, are primarily sold to packaged food companies. Demand from these customers is currently strong as they are experiencing the same increase in consumption as we are in our consumer segment.In contrast, our restaurant and distributor customers are experiencing significant short term pain related to the reduction of people traveling, shopping and dining out, with many restaurants and away-from-home eating locations closed. Consequently, we are expecting a sharp and negative impact on the demand for our products from these customers.While we expect this demand to return once the COVID-19 crisis passes, similar to the beginning stages of recovery we're seeing in China, the duration of this current period of reduced demand is uncertain given changing conditions across the world almost daily.Our current flavor solutions priority is to work with all of our customers, those seeing demand surges, as well as those under pressure, managed through the coming months. We have confidence that the strong and differentiated partnerships we have built with our customers, which includes the top 10 food and beverage companies, as well as the top 10 food service restaurant chains enables a robust collaboration needed to navigate through this situation as best as possible.Now I'd like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 12 before turning it over to Mike. At the foundation of our sales growth is the global and growing consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating, as well as transparency around the source and quality of ingredients and the desire to buy brands from environmentally and socially responsible companies.Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category as we inspire flavor exploration across all markets through all channels and are aligned with the consumers demand for taste, convenience, health and sustainably minded business practices.Our alignment with these long-term trends, our breadth and reach, and our execution of effective strategies positions us well to meet increased consumer demand, both through our products and through our customers products and drive sales growth.No matter what, where or when people are eating or drinking, it is likely flavored by McCormick. We believe these long-term behaviors will remain intact following the current crisis.We're continuing to drive long-term sales growth balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins and sustainably realize long-term earnings growth. We have a solid foundation and an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast-paced we are ensuring we remain agile, relevant and focused on long-term sustainable growth.Our experienced leaders and employees are executing on our strategies, which are designed to build long-term value for shareholders while reacting to changes accordingly and capitalizing on opportunities.Excluding the China COVID-19 impact, we delivered solid first quarter results, again, proving our strategies are effective and we're confident they will drive future growth. While we know the balance of the year will be impacted by an uncertain environment, we're confident our underlying foundation and performance remains strong.I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for driving our momentum and success and thank them for their efforts, engagement and for adapting to this new environment during this volatile time.As food and food products have been designated to critical industry, I want to particularly thank our many employees who are working hard every day to protect the food supply and are rallying to support McCormick and their communities.Thank you for your attention. And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 29. We delivered solid first quarter results, excluding the COVID-19 impact on China and recognize the balance of the year will be impacted by a broader challenging environment. We're effectively executing our strategies and are confident in our underlying foundation.We are responding to COVID-19 developments with agility and working through the challenges of today, while keeping our focus on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful.We have a consistent history of growth and very positive fundamentals in place to manage through this short term period of volatility and continue on our long-term growth trajectory. Our commitment to our long-term financial objectives has not changed. We are sustainably positioned for growth and will continue to deliver differentiated results.Now, let's turn to your questions. Right. Thank you, Ken. You too, Ken. Sure, Ken. Great. Well, first of all, we're seeing all phases of the coronavirus crisis as a company, from the early phases of recovery in China through the new epicenters that we're all experiencing in the EMEA and in the US.We've got - we are seeing the early stages of recovery in China, as we said in the prepared remarks. We can pretty well quantify that and we see a path forward there, and we've given some outlook on that.In the Americas and EMEA, we're seeing very strong sales of retail products, as our others, especially in the Americas, it cuts across all channels on the - of the - our retail and consumer-oriented product, especially strong in e-commerce.We just actually got in a fresh scanner data this morning, ourselves. I mentioned a moment ago that we were up about 65% as a total company through the scanner for the most recent week that we had data for. We just got last week's information, and it's even stronger than that. It's nearly 90%, I'd say.So it's a little over 89% for total company, through the U.S. - sorry, total company in the US, total consumer there. So really strong performance on that side, driven by the consumer pantry stocking behavior. And I think that you all probably got Nielsen data that covers the same time frame. That would be roughly consistent with that.And typically, our unmeasured channels are stronger than the measured channels, and I would expect that to be - you can - should expect that to be the same again.In our flavor solutions portion of our business, the portion of the business that's a little over 50% - that's over 50% that services the other CPG manufacturers is seeing an equally strong surge in demand. As those customers are having the same retail offtake and we're part of their supply chain, so we're experiencing that.The food service portion of the business goes the other way. And we've tried to give some additional color on the size of our foodservice business in these remarks than we've given in the past. So I don't think we've previously really quantified how big our total away-from-home consumption exposure is.Between branded foodservice and the quick service restaurant industry, it's a little over 20%. Most of that runs through flavor solutions in China and India, that goes through the consumer segment because they share common distribution channels, common packs, and it's rolled up in that way.But in the food service, we're seeing a - in food service and QSR, we're seeing a sharp slowdown. We came into the month strong. But as we've gone through the month, that has slowed significantly.Specifically saying in the EMEA, the QSR portion has come to a near halt, as the whole - as most of our customers have completely closed their restaurants. The difference between Europe and the US and in the US drive through a pickup has remained open. That's not the case in most of the major countries in Europe. And so that part of the business is going to have a strong impact.Oh, and you asked about supply chain. So let me take the second part of that. Our global sourcing organization has really been an advantage for us. We - and the experience that we had in China allowed us to see pretty early that we were going to need to do contingency planning. We started that very early on. We have actual people on the ground in the countries that we sort from, which has really been helpful in working with local authorities and local closures and restrictions.And in particular, working out transportation logistics, and we source over 14,000 raw materials from over 85 countries, in the world. We have - we're really well prepared for this, and I'd say that, this has been a real area of advantage for us.We're currently not constrained on any production due to raw material or packaging shortage. We've had some minor items. I mean, I could talk with you about a particular spec of anthel [ph] chilli that is needed for our Hispanic business here in the US, its cost about $3,000 worth of product. I mean, we're tracking it at that granular level. And I think that we're in a really good shape from a supply chain standpoint. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah, for the year, of course, we - there's so much uncertainty on how this is going to unfold. I know others have given some guidance. Those have tended to be companies that are in their fourth quarter already. So they are basically giving you guidance for the next six weeks. We've got a whole year ahead of us. This is just the end of our first quarter.We're one month into Q2. And the changes and shifts have been so dramatic over just the last couple of weeks that I think that we're not comfortable even - we don't normally give quarterly guidance, and we'd be even less comfortable doing so right now.We really don't know the duration and the extent of the impact on the restaurant industry in particular. There are areas of the world that are still open for business. There are areas that are closed that could reopen. And we think that there's too much uncertainty for us to give you credible meaningful guidance right now on that.I will say that - I would expect that the restaurant industry impact will be pretty heavy in the second quarter. Again, the complete closure of restaurants in some areas, even though it's the minority of our business is going to be a drag that I think it's hard to see the consumer side overcoming in this particular quarter. I just want to elaborate on it. We are pausing the ERP program, but we are committed to our long-term success. And as a company, we take a long-term view of our program. So we're investing behind our employees right now. We're continuing to invest in brand marketing and it's our intent to continue the ERP program.So we do have a team that will continue to work on it through the year and we would expect to - that the go-lives that we were planning are going to slide out 12 months or so and be back.And right now, there are two drivers for a decision to postpone it. One is, just the executional reality. Our pilots for - one of our pilots was in Italy, for example, and it has become as an executional matter impossible to do that pilot and the other pilot is also in an area where because of travel restrictions, it just wasn't possible to do the training and work that it takes to actually bring the system up. And with no pilots there, no go-lives. And so from an executional standpoint, sheer practicality required us to push the program out.And then secondly, as we have prioritized keeping our brands and our customers brands in supply and maintaining business continuity the resources that we're going into the program were better spent right now on the urgent needs and adapting to the rapidly changing supply requirements. Thanks, Andrew. You bet. So Faiza, we've changed - well, first of all, we've continued to deliver the brand marketing that we had planned to, but some of the messaging and the vehicles that we're using have shifted. This is part of the advantage of having our in-house marketing excellence organization, we're able to change - produce new content and change the content very rapidly. And so we made the message a bit more relevant. I gave some examples in our prepared remarks. And I think that has had a good impact.We've resourced up an area where consumers can write in and get real-time answers to their questions. That's a somewhat people-intensive thing, but it's been very much appreciated by consumers.The new products that we talked about at CAGNY were already largely being launched. And so while retailers have focused more on core items as they have scrambled to keep their shelf stock. We had a lot of placement on those items and a lot of acceptance on those items already.And although we didn't talk about our second half new items at CAGNY, our R&D teams have continued to work on it. Our commercial teams - commercialization teams have continued to work on those. And I would expect - you should expect to see a reasonable pipeline of new products in the second half of the year as well.The shelf reset that we talked about also was already underway. And so the picture, for example, that I used at CAGNY was in an actual store. It was not some kind of a retail lab, but it was an actual store installation. We have a number of them up.Right now those installations have stop, because of the immediate demand at retail and everybody trying to minimize extra people in the store. But as all these shelter-in-place rules and so on get lifted and things hopefully return to normal in the second half of the year, we would expect that to remain.We didn't quantify how many stores. We said we would have. I think I said at CAGNY that we would have thousands of them though. We still expect to have thousands, but fewer than we would have thought at CAGNY. Hi, Alexia. Good morning. Okay. I'm not sure I get the answers to the exact questions that you're asking, but I do know that we - that the consumer behavioral changes that we're seeing are significant. And rather than thinking of panel data, we actually have - we're actually doing our own real-time consumer tracking. And so we have our own data that shows how behaviors are unfolding. There is definitely an interest in cooking at home more kind of around comfort foods, a little bit around the same trends that - some of the trends that we have talked about previously or actually - are just magnified or accelerated, so shopping online, some more adventurous cooking. Mike, do you want to add. Yeah, Alexia, it's a great question. Most of our facilities make products for both segments of our business. And so we can move resources within those facilities. Some of the foodservice items are being repurposed to the club store channel right now as well. And so we're able to do that. And even beyond the manufacturing facilities, we were able to move our people to focus in on the right area. So we have a lot of flexibility on that.There are a couple of exceptions. We do have one manufacturing facility in Europe that is heavily dedicated to sauces for the QSR and food service industry. And demand is very, very slow there, and it's difficult to repurpose that. But generally speaking, we've got 118 facilities around the world. We have 49 production plants. They are all able to operate, and we're able to shift volume around to meet the current demand. Thank you, Alexia. Actually, we lean towards the latter few. This pantry stocking behavior, obviously, is a one-time surge that isn't sustainable. But there is real incremental consumption that's happening. The kids are staying - are in from school. People are trying to stay close to home, either voluntarily or by government order.And people, as a result are getting used to the idea of cooking at home and are learning new cooking behaviors. We're - our demand for recipes and how to videos on our digital properties is absolutely through the roof. The kind of questions we're getting for our real-time response is all about cooking tips and how to prepare and what to prepare. And we think that there is going to be a sustained shift for a period of time to more at home cooking, which in the past has been a net benefit to us.The other thing I don't want to miss is that kind of the after - however, the COVID-19 situation plays out, it's likely we're going to be followed by a recessionary period as well. Historically, we've performed well during the recessionary period. Consumers tend to do cook more at home. And they're cutting back in other areas, they tend to reward themselves a little bit with the foods that they consume at home.And our historical track record, just looking back at the 2001 and the 2008, \u201809 time period, we've had strong growth in our consumer business. That's been a positive for us overall as a company. Great, it's awesome. And there's some expense and work has been done this year, which contributes to it also. So the shape of it will likely be different. Thanks. You asked about promotions, and so this kind of goes to that. So we are running fewer promotions. I think we might have had that in our prepared - my prepared comments and that's really in collaboration with our customers who, frankly, are having a hard time executing against those.That's probably going to add some impact on Easter, but I think that whatever impact there is on Easter, it's going to be lost in the shuffle because of the tremendous surge right now. We are seeing the right seasonal items doing strongly in vanilla for baking a big item right now.Easter is a less important holiday for McCormick. We often talk about Easter because you've got to get the Easter displays down to get the grilling displays up. And the grilling season starts after Easter, and I'd say that's the bigger factor for us is getting the grilling items out there. And honestly, with people staying at home more, we actually expect our grilling season to be really good. Thanks. Yeah. On the pantry stock, I think that there's real incremental consumption and it's not going to be something that's going to have to be de-loaded. We're talking about spices used to - spices, seasoning, condiments used to \u2013 if you look to recipe mixes used to cook meals at home, and there is more food consumption happening at home.Consumers really are eating this up. It's not like toilet paper where at some time, there's going to - there'd be such a glut on the market that it's going to freeze up. There's real incremental usage here that we think is not going to require any kind of consumer pantry unloading, at least as near as we can measure at this time. And I'd say that that would probably play into the uncertainty about it, but we have a point of view on it. Rob, I also want to - so I want to remind you that, China was largely on lockdown through most of the month of March. And so there's going to be a pretty - there's going to be a significant impact from China. They are in recovery now. But Hubei province actually just reopening now, and so - for example, so there is going to be an impact from that as well. I'd say, mostly a first half of it. Thanks, Rob. Right. I wish it was that easy. But I think a lot of what - I mean, right now, I mean, trade marketing is really about customer support and working with our customers collaboratively to keep them in supply with the items that are selling the fastest.And so the reason that there's a reduction in promotion activity is frankly, the customers can't keep up with it, and so you stop. So there's - so we shouldn't have stopped. So we have curtailed some promotions.It's hard to see how that is kind of to play out as we go through the year, I think that we're just going through an extraordinary period right now that will reach a new equilibrium, and we'll be able to continue with the promotional activity that's meaningful with our customer. I think that the extent of the consumer pantry stocking and the suddenness with which it hit is a surprise to everyone. But in terms of you know, when you piece it apart and you look at orders of magnitude, the items with the highest velocities are not a surprise. They're recipe mix. It's our condiments.Frank's RedHot Sauce, frankly, these items are not items that are stockpiled, but that tend to be consumed pretty quickly. And that are the ones that are seeing some of the biggest increases. Good morning. And going forward, the wheel that Mike was talking about, the branded foodservice component has margins that are comparable to our consumer business. So there's a mix of margin structures within that. There's the branded food service with consumer-like margins and there's a quick service restaurant piece, which is part of the business that we generally characterize as low margin. Yeah, I can't really - I would really be speculating on that. We are - I would say we are keeping up with the demand. It is challenging right now to keep up with that demand.And I would say that if we had not been as well prepared as we were on the supply chain side and also, frankly, building some inventory in preparation for our ERP shift that - which might echoes down all the way through our supply chain, we would really - we'd be even more stressed than we are right now. Well, exactly, definitely not said what it was and you know we're not going to say more than it's significant. It is a fast changing situation. Restaurant openings and closures are being announced almost daily. And I think that it's - I think that we're really not in a position to give you or your colleague's meaningful credible guidance in this area right now. And likewise on NPD, I've already commented on the first quarter, so I won't repeat the - sorry, first half, and I won't repeat that. But again, as we take a long-term perspective on our business, our R&D teams and our marketing teams and commercialization teams are continuing to work on NPD. And we have a good pipeline. Again this will pass and there'll be - there's going to be an important place for new products just as always has been. Thanks. Sure. So I think that your math is right. I wouldn't say that it's all second quarter, but we do see a ramping up of the business, but a strong impact in the second quarter. And that you're in the right order of magnitude there in terms of the impact that we expect.Regarding the food service industry in China, most of our customers have gone - have publicly stated that their restaurants are open and they are. And consumer traffic is slowly building. That opening has occurred over a period of weeks, but our teams would confirm that the restaurants are open.And they are depending on the region, some of the areas where recovery is furthest along like in Shanghai. And they're seeing 30% or as much as 50%. Normal traffic in places like Hubei, you know, the openings are only - they are only like a few days or weeks into them and consumers are still not confident enough or have the freedom of movement to get into those restaurants.Hope that gives you some good color. We've got almost 3,000 people in China, including 1,000 in Wuhan. So, we have a pretty good pulse of what's actually happening on the ground there. Our experience is that we've done well during those recessionary times. I don't want you to forget that we're a supplier of private label. And both - private label does well, so do our brands, and we've had good growth.We, again, look back at the last two recessionary periods, and our consumer business growth was strong. I think we mentioned those numbers in the prepared remarks. I'd say that our US consumer business was actually slightly stronger than the numbers that we quoted for total company. Thank you. Great. Thanks, everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. And thank you for your patience for staying over. We did want to take all of the questions. And so, we've run a little bit long. McCormick is a leader in flavor, and we're differentiated with a broad and advantaged portfolio, which continues to drive growth. We have growing and profitable business and operate in an environment that is changing at an ever faster pace. We deliver flavor to all markets and channels, while responding readily to changes in the industry and the world with new ideas, innovation and purpose.One of the most significant risks to any company is being unprepared to respond with agility to a significant unexpected disruption. We are all experiencing that disruption now, and McCormick is well prepared, not only to manage through it, but to emerge stronger.With a relentless focus on growth, performance and people, we are confident our strategies will enable us to become even better positioned to drive future growth and build long-term value for our shareholders."

            "name": "Michael Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin now by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance and then discuss some of our expectations for the balance of the year.Starting on slide 14, during the first quarter sales declined 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by the COVID-19 impact in China, which had a negative 3% constant currency effect on the total company.Excluding the impact of China, favorable volume and product mix from base business and new products, as well as pricing drove sales growth. The consumer segment sales declined 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by the Asia, Pacific region.On slide 15, consumer segment sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2019. As Lawrence described earlier, the decline was driven by trade inventory reductions, with a partial offset from pricing actions which were taking late during the first quarter.In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales were up 1% from a year ago, driven by pricing, primarily related to the timing of trade promotional activities. Consumer sales in Asia Pacific declined 28% in constant currency, driven by the China disruption. Growth was strong across the rest of the region.Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on slide 18, we grew first quarter constant currency sales 5% due to strong growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 5%, driven by new products and base business volume growth, with particular strength of snack seasonings and branded food service. Additionally, pricing also contributed to growth across the portfolio.In EMEA, we grew flavor solutions sales 9% in constant currency. Sales increased to both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies, driven by new products and volume growth on the base business, as well as pricing. In the Asia, Pacific region, flavor solutions sales declined 4% in constant currency, driven by the decline in China. Other parts of the region drove growth.Across both segments are seen on slide 22, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, declined to 2% in the first quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency.Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined to 12% to $120 million, which in constant currency was an 11% decline. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose to $76 million, a 19% increase, with minimal impact from currency.Both segments were negatively impacted by the China disruption, which was a 10% impact to the total company and was skewed more to the consumer segment, as well as incremental investments related to our ERP replacement program, with partial offsets from CCI-led cost savings and lower incentive-based compensation.Additionally, the consumer segment's adjusted operating income was unfavorably impacted by an increase in brand marketing expenses and flavor solutions was favorably impacted by product mix.Gross profit margin expanded 90 basis points in the first quarter versus the year-ago period, driven by CCI-led cost savings. We have adjusted operating margin compression of 10 basis points, driven by the factors I just mentioned.Turning to income taxes on slide 24. Our first quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18.4%, as compared to 13.9% in the year-ago period. Fourth quarter's adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items, primarily related to refinements to our entity structure, which had a more significant impact last year.Income from unconsolidated operations was $10 million in the first quarter of both years. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 26, first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.08, as compared to $1.12 for the year-ago period.The decline was primarily driven by the China disruption impact and a higher adjusted income tax rate from last year, with partial offsets from higher adjusted operating income growth, excluding China, and lower interest expense.On slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow provided from operations was $45 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2019. This decrease was driven by timing associated with working capital, as well as employee incentive and benefit payments.We continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle, finishing the first quarter at 40 days, down three days versus our fiscal year end. We returned $82 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $39 million for capital expenditures this period.We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our operating, investing and financial needs through our operating cash flows, as well as our access to bank lines and commercial paper. We have been able to access commercial paper markets as needed during the recent period of market volatility and currently have unutilized capacity under our $1 billion corporate revolver.We have no material debt maturities until 2021, and we expect no material change to our capital allocation. We continue to evaluate the market to determine if there is an opportunity to further bolster our position given the low underlying interest rates.Let's now move to a discussion about our outlook and some of our expectations for the balance of the year, as seen on slide 28. As a reminder, the guidance we issued in January and discussed at CAGNY does not include any impact from COVID-19.We are operating in a very fluid environment. And our ability to assess the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is affected by both the speed at which the situation is evolving, as well as the high degree of uncertainty related to the duration and extent of the impact on consumer demand in all channels and the global economy.We are also still early in our fiscal year, with three quarters remaining, including those that are typically our largest ones. We therefore are withdrawing our previously issued 2020 financial outlook discussed on our January earnings call. I would like to, however, provide additional perspective to highlight some current expectations.First, as we have already mentioned, there was a significant COVID-19 impact from China to our first quarter results, and we project disruption in China continuing into the second quarter.We expect the lower sales from the COVID-19 impact in China will reduce our total global net sales growth by 1% to 2% for the year. We believe the China impact cannot be extrapolated to the overall impact for the rest of the company due to the reasons Lawrence already mentioned earlier.Differences related to lockdown durations and pantry stocking opportunities, as well as the different percentages of foodservice business and other dynamics in each region.We expect the shift in consumer consumption will continue with our consumer segment positively impacted by initial pantry stocking and followed by an increased preference for cooking at home.In our Flavor Solutions segment, we expect increased demand from our packaged food customers similar to our consumer segment. However, in the away-from-home part of our flavor solutions portfolio, which represents approximately 20% of our total company sales, we expect sharp declines in demand from our restaurants and other foodservice customers.Given the current economic environment, we are closely following the movements in foreign exchange rates and are anticipating a negative impact on our full year financial results.And finally, as Lawrence mentioned, we are moderating the pace of our ERP replacement program. As a result of this decision, we are projecting our program operating expenses in 2020 to be comparable to 2019.We continue to closely monitor the situation and expect to resume guidance during our second quarter earnings call at the end of June, when we should know more. We have managed through multiple business cycles for 130 years and have a consistent history of growth.We are well positioned, given our financial strength, stable cash generation, asset access to liquidity and have rapidly implemented appropriate mitigation plans. We are confident we will manage through the short term period of volatility and continue on our long-term growth trajectory.I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks, before we move to your questions. Hey, Andrew. It's Mike. You're correct. We spent around $20 million last year in 2019, and we're going to spend around $20 million this year in 2020. So it's not incremental. It's at the same as comparable between the fiscal years. Yeah, I think - and we're doing a lot of our research, even with our employees. One of the questions - one of the comments we had back from employees are snacking a lot more at home because they're home working and the snacks are right there.So pushing a huge lift in both cooking activities and everything food is people being adventures them, too. They're trying to use what's in their pantry, jazz it up a bit, and we've seen very strong sales of a lot of exotic spices and flavoring. No, Steve, just like we're not giving second quarter guidance or 2020 guidance, we're not going to give 2021 or \u201822. I mean, there will be some type of shift. We just - it's really too early. We need to re-plan this project, work around our manufacturing busy seasons and things like that. So yeah, I hesitate, but I can't give you really any guidance there. Yeah. Part of that is hard to answer and goes to the uncertainty that makes us not want to give guidance at this time. And that there are puts and takes and they're changing so fast that I don't know that we can give - we're not 100% - we're not sure enough on how those balance out.Your point is well taken. By a longer run, more core items that that's a very efficient way to run our manufacturing facilities. There are also a lot of extra costs related to expediting at over time - over time, definitely. We just announced that we are paying premium wages to the people who come to work. We haven't talked about it, but we're doing, I think, temperature scans at all the entrances to facilities, which has a cost. And so we're - I'd say that right now, there's some uncertainty about how those are going to balance out that we will sort through.If we were maybe two more weeks into it, we have a better handle on it, but these are things that are literally changing day-by-day. So, things like transportation, fuel rates are down, you see that at the gas pump. But some shipping rates are up too. So we're just too early at this point. I think on the - your question about kind of the structural margin, you are right, we had a really great first quarter from a margin perspective at the gross margin line flavor solutions. We continue the portfolio migration. Our CCI teams have done a great job, and we'll continue to do a great job during this crisis.We have a lot of volume favorabilities. The problem is going forward, Rob, if some of the volume drops off, some of those go away from an overhead absorption perspective, so you can't really count on those to continue. But obviously, we'll give you more guidance as we can. And as more consumers really go online to digital \u2013 and we've been migrating our trade spend to digital for the last couple of years. So you'll see more of that there. Hey, Chris. This is Mike. If you remember the flavor wheel, we show the flavor solutions breakout, where we have about 45% of our flavor solutions businesses in flavors. That's generally the higher margin business, and we talked about portfolio migration more to that.Custom condiments, coatings, ingredients, generally lower margin business. We have talked to some really good margin in there, so I don't want to characterize the whole group. But it's generally lower than the flavor side of the business.Specifically talking about China, I mean, China is a very developed market for us. We have scale there. We have large manufacturing facilities, lots of people. So the margins there are generally good across consumer and flavor solutions. So that's why you're seeing a pretty significant impact in Q1 from a profit perspective. There was a second part of your question. Chris, what was it? Yeah, you would think - I mean, I think customers are trying to grow their inventories right now. I don't know that they're being successful. I mean, if you walk into any store you're going to see, they don't have stock on their shelves in a lot of areas.It's hard to - I don't know where that is going to stabilize. I'd say right now, I don't think anyone in the - a retail or customer side is thinking about inventory reduction. I think right now they're scrambling to stay in stock. What we can say, it's different in different regions with the world, like we said before, EMEA has seen a significant downturn because of the government actions without shutting down everything. Hey, Dave. This is Mike. CCI, good question. CCI has been a long-term program for us since 2009. We have a really strong pipeline of projects coming into this year and it's ingrained in our culture. We have teams still working on CCI programs.You're right though, it puts a lot of stress on the organization competing priorities. But that is not any - that's not a factor in any withdrawal of our guidance. We still feel confident about our CCI program.Again, in the second quarter, and we always say this too shall pass to some degree. And hopefully, things get back to the new normal, but we still feel real confident in our CCI program and achieving those results."

Thank you for joining today\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. We will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO, and we will close with a question-and-answer session. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of these non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. In addition, as a reminder, today\u2019s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on slide two for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on slide four, our fourth quarter completed another year of robust and sustained growth. In 2021, we remained focused on growth, performance and people, driving another year of strong results and continuing our momentum. We drove record sales growth by executing on our long-term strategies, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities, all while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing global environment. The profit driven by our strong sales growth in 2021, while tempered by the well-known headwinds of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges was also strong. Our 2021 operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures and did so again in the fourth quarter, and we expect to do the same through this inflationary environment using pricing and other levers to fully offset cost pressures over time. The breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio ideally position us to fully knowing demand for flavor around the world and drive continued differentiated growth. This has never been more evident than over the last two years as consumers adapted to the ever-changing environment. Our compelling offerings in our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segment for every retail and customer strategy across all channels create a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive growth and consistency in our performance. It also gives us significant flexibility to adapt to changing conditions wherever they may arise and continue on our growth trajectory. This is a significant differentiator in the dynamic environment in which we currently operate. We are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion regardless of whether the occasion is consumed at-home or away-from-home through our products and our customers\u2019 products. We are end-to-end flavor. Now turning to slide six and our fourth quarter results, our performance was at the high end of the guidance range we provided for sales and adjusted operating profit on our last earnings call and exceeded the guidance range we provided for adjusted earnings per share. On our topline versus the year ago period, we grew fourth quarter sales 11%. Both of our segments delivered strong growth with contributions from base business growth, driven by higher volume and pricing actions, as well as new products and acquisitions. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share both increased 6%, driven by growth from higher sales and CCI led cost savings, partially offset by cost inflation. Let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter segment business performance, which includes some comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which we believe are meaningful given the level of demand volatility from quarter-to-quarter experienced in 2020. Starting on slide seven, Consumer segment sales grew 10%, including incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition. The increase was driven by strong volume growth and the impact of pricing actions phased in during the quarter as we discussed on our last earnings call. Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpace its pre-pandemic level. Our Americas sales growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI Consumption Data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 1%, following a 17% consumption increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a two-year basis. As we previously discussed in the year ago period, elevated demand challenged our supply chain were as in 2021, but the actions we took to add capacity and increase resilience, we were far better positioned and able to ship in line with consumption. Demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving, as is our share performance, with another sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, as we expected. We continue to see further improvement in our recent performance as we begin 2022. Importantly, and as I just mentioned, we are better positioned than we were a year ago, and are confident in our continued momentum. Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the fourth quarter of 2019 was the seventh consecutive quarter that our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the two-year ago period. Our key categories also continued to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the two-year ago period. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. And when consumers shop they are buying and therefore using more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. Now turning to EMEA, during the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we gained market share in key categories and across the region. Similar to the U.S., our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two-year-ago period and when consumers shop, they are buying more than they were pre-pandemic. And in the Asia-Pacific region, our fourth quarter performance continued to reflect the recovery of China\u2019s lower branded food service sales last year, as well as consumer consumption growth across the region. Turning to slide nine, our Flavor Solutions segment grew 14%, reflecting higher base volume growth in new products, as well as pricing actions to partially offset cost inflation, and contributions from FONA and Cholula acquisitions. On a two-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions. In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our fourth quarter growth. Additionally, we continue to see robust growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers, as well as the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers as more dining out options are open versus a year ago. We continue to execute on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products in the region, both through the addition of FONA and Cholula to our portfolio, as well as the exit of some lower margin business. Turning to EMEA, which has continued its strong momentum, we are winning in all channels with double-digit fourth quarter growth to quick service restaurants or QSRs, branded food service customers and packaged food and beverage customers. Recovery has been robust in the away-from-home part of the portfolio and growth in our at-home offerings has been outstanding. Notably, for the full year, on a two-year basis, we have driven 19% constant currency growth across the portfolio. In APZ, our momentum with our QSR customers remains strong, driving double-digit growth versus 2020, as well as on a two-year basis. As for the fourth quarter and in line with what we\u2019ve said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Moving to our fourth quarter results, I am pleased to share highlights of our full fiscal year, including an update on our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, starting on slide 10. We drove record sales growth in 2021, growing sales 13% to $6.3 billion with strong organic sales growth and a 4% contribution from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. Notably, on a two-year basis, we grew sales 18%, reflecting a robust and sustained growth momentum in both of our segments. Our Consumer segment sales growth of 9% was driven by consumer sustained preference for cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, strong digital engagement and new products, as well as growth from Cholula. Versus 2019 we grew sales 20%, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands. Our Flavor Solutions segment growth of 19% reflected the strong continued momentum with the at-home products in our portfolio, including a record year of new product growth and a robust recovery from last year\u2019s lower demand for away-from-home products, as well as contributions from FONA and Cholula. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and away-from-home products in our portfolio. On a two-year basis, we grew sales 15%, driven by the at-home part of our portfolio, the demand for the away-from-home portion recovering to pre-pandemic levels. We have consistently driven industry-leading sales growth resulting in McCormick being named to the latest Fortune 500. We\u2019re proud of our sustained performance and for being included in this prestigious group of industry-leading companies. At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our 36th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Finally, we continue to be recognized for doing what\u2019s right for people, communities and the planet. During the year, McCormick was named the United Nations Global Compact Lead Company and awarded the inaugural Terra Carta Seal from his royal highness of price of oil, our industry leadership in creating a sustainable future. And just last week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2022 Global 100 Sustainability Index as the world\u2019s 14th most sustainable corporation and for the sixth consecutive year number one in the food products sector. Moving to the one-year anniversary of our two fantastic recent acquisitions, Cholula and FONA are creating value, achieving synergies and delivering results according to our plans. Importantly, we\u2019ve achieved our one-year sales and earnings per share accretion expectations for both Cholula and FONA. I\u2019d like to share some comments about the successful execution of our growth plans and then in a few moments, Mike, will cover in more detail our delivery on acquisition plans. Starting with Cholula on slide 12, the addition of this beloved iconic brand with authentic Mexican flavor is accelerating the growth of our global condiment platform. In our Consumer segment, we\u2019re unlocking Cholula\u2019s significant growth potential by using our category management expertise, leveraging e-commerce investments, launching new products and optimizing brand marketing spend. We executed on initiatives this past year, including optimizing shelf placement and assortment, expanding into new channels, gaining momentum in e-commerce, where Cholula had been underpenetrated, increasing awareness, both through brand marketing investments and brand partnerships such as with DoorDash and leveraging promotional scale across McCormick brands. We are excited about the results our initiatives are yielding. During 2021, we gained significant momentum on top of lapping elevated growth in 2020, adding new households and growing Cholula\u2019s consumption 13% in 2021 versus last year. Cholula is continuing to outpace category growth and gain share, combined with 19% total distribution point growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, it is clear our plans are driving accelerated growth. And notably, we drove Cholula to the number two hot sauce brand in the U.S., joining Frank\u2019s RedHot, the number one ranked brand at the top of the category. We are just as excited about Cholula\u2019s performance as part of our Flavor Solutions portfolio. With our broad presence across foodservice channel, we have strengthened Cholula\u2019s go-to-market model through 2021. We continue to build on Cholula\u2019s strong front-of-house presence, which builds trial and brand awareness beyond food service, with significant double-digit growth of portion control packs as more restaurant meals are now consumed as delivery or takeaway. Leveraging our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, we\u2019ve also driven double-digit growth in our back-of-house foodservice penetration through recipe inspiration and increasing Cholula\u2019s menu participation. We are growing with big national accounts and smaller independent restaurants, as well as expanding distribution through leveraging the strength of our distributor relationships where Cholula was less developed. We are succeeding with new menu items, including both permanent ones and limited time offers. Our momentum with Cholula is very strong, and we are confident our initiatives will continue to build on consumer\u2019s growing passion for heat and drive further growth of this fantastic brand. Now turning to FONA, the addition of this leading North American flavor manufacturer is accelerating the growth of our global flavors platform. We are thrilled our first year of owning FONA has been a record year for the business with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category continued to drive significant growth for FONA up 15% compared to last year. FONA\u2019s new product wins and its pipeline potential have also hit record high fueling future growth. We are continuing to drive growth and create new opportunities with our global footprint. We are leveraging GEODIS infrastructure to expand FONA\u2019s flavors into the EMEA region. In our APZ region, the combination of our infrastructure, which includes our recent flavor capability investments to China and FONA\u2019s local application and flavor creation talent is unlocking further potential to accelerate flavor growth in that region. And just a few months ago, we began our expansion of FONA\u2019s footprint to increase our Americas flavor manufacturing capacity, an investment we planned as part of our acquisition model, enabling us to deliver the future growth we expect. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale, as well as increasing our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our collective customers with a more comprehensive product offering and fueling more opportunities for growth across our entire portfolio. We are cross-selling products across benefit of our combination within our own portfolio. For instance, with FONA now leveraging McCormick\u2019s USDA savory flavors and developing flavors for pet food applications. The combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to participate on briefs that capitalize on core strength across McCormick and FONA, enabling us to build a robust pipeline of opportunities, and importantly, win and grow with our customers. We are thrilled with both Cholula and FONA. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions, as well as our confidence that we will continue to achieve our plan, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only continued to strengthen. In summary, for 2021 we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment and the at-home part of our Flavor Solutions segment. We have successfully navigated through the pandemic-related disruption in the away-from-home portion of our Flavor Solutions segment and Cholula and FONA have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. All of this reinforces our confidence for continued growth in 2022. The global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great, fast growing categories and will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and favorable cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies, sustainably positions us for future growth. In this current dynamic and fast paced environment, we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges similar to the rest of the industry. To partially offset rising costs, we raised prices where appropriately last year and began to realize the impact of those actions in our fourth quarter sales growth. As costs have continued to accelerate, we are raising prices again where appropriate in 2022. These pricing actions are on track and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have grown and compounded our growth regardless of short-term pressures and plan to do so again in 2022, as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. Across our Consumer segment, our 2022 plans include continuing to build consumer\u2019s confidence in the kitchen, inspire their home cooking and flavor exploration, and accelerate flavored usage, including delivering on the global demand for heat. We also plan to strengthen our consumer relationships at every point of purchase, as well as create delicious, healthy and sustainable future. In our investments in brand marketing, category management and new products, we expect to drive further sales growth. For our Flavor Solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2022. Our plans include targeting opportunities to grow with our customers at attractive high growth categories, continuing to leverage our broad technology platform to develop clean and natural solutions that taste great and strengthening our leadership in heat. For the culinary inspired innovation and our passion for creating a flawless customer experience, we plan to continue our new product momentum and drive further sales growth. Our achievements in 2021, our effective growth strategies, as well as our robust operating momentum, all bolster our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2022 growth plan in just a few weeks at CAGNY. In summary, we have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate through this ever-changing environment, responding with agility to volatility and disruptions, while remaining focused on our long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. A combination of our strong business model, the investments we\u2019ve made, the capabilities we\u2019ve built and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through topline growth and margin expansion. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick\u2019s employees around the world have done a tremendous job of navigating this past year\u2019s volatile environment. Their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor drive our momentum and success and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide additional remarks on our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to build upon Lawrence\u2019s comments on Cholula and FONA, and highlight how we have delivered on our acquisition plans now as we have completed the first year. Starting on slide 19, as Lawrence already shared, we have created value by driving sales growth according to our plans. In addition, Cholula was margin accretive to the gross and operating margins in both of our segments, and FONA was accretive to the margins in the Flavor Solutions segment. We are delivering against our synergy and one-time cost estimates, in fact doing better than our acquisition plan. Starting with our original synergy targets, for Cholula, we have achieved the target of $10 million to be fully realized by 2022. For FONA, we are on track to achieve our targeted $7 million by the end of 2023. We are also achieving revenue synergies as expected. Our transaction and integration costs for Cholula and FONA are both lower than our acquisition plans. Early in 2021, we took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following the acquisitions, raising $1 billion through the issuance of five-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes, and therefore, realized lower interest expense than we originally projected. Additionally, our ongoing amortization expense is favorable to both of the acquisition models. In summary, we executed our year one acquisition plans in line with and in some areas better than our modeled, including the adjusted earnings per share accretion we expected. Successful acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy. Importantly, we have a proven track record of driving value through acquisitions and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, and Cholula and FONA are adding to that history. Now for our fourth quarter and full year performance, starting on slide 20, our fourth quarter capped off a year of record sales growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew constant currency sales 10%, with higher volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributing to the increases in both segments. Our organic sales growth was 6%, driven by strong growth in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments, and incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency, with both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments growing double digits. During the fourth quarter, our Consumer segment sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix, pricing actions and a 2% increase from our Cholula acquisition. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales grew 14% in constant currency, led by the Americas. On slide 21, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 13% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher volume and product mix, as the sustained shift to at-home consumption continues to drive increased demand, as well as lapping last year\u2019s capacity constraints. Pricing actions and a 3% increase from the Cholula acquisition also contributed to sales growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales increased 19% in constant currency, driven by broad-based growth across branded products, as well as an increase from the Cholula acquisition. A decline in private label sales partially offset the branded growth. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 5% from a year ago, due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. On a two-year basis, sales increased 5% in constant currency, driven by growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauce and mustard. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 11% in constant currency, due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China or away-from-home products and higher sales of cooking at-home products across the region. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales were flat, with growth across the region offset by a sales decline in India, due to the exit of some lower margin business. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on slide 24, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 12%, including a 7% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13% year-over-year, with FONA and Cholula contributing 11%. Organic sales growth was driven by the recovery of demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings and pricing. On a two-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019, driven by higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business in other parts of the portfolio. In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 16% compared to last year, due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers, as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, both driven by QSR growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customer\u2019s limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on slide 28, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges, increased 6% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment increased 14% or in constant currency 13%. Higher sales and CCI led cost savings more than offset cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges. Brand marketing investments as planned were 10% lower in the quarter, following an 18% Consumer segment increase in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, we increased our brand marketing investments 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 16% or 15% in constant currency. Higher sales and CCI led cost savings were more than offset by the cost pressures in this segment, unfavorable product mix and costs related to supply chain investments. Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERP program was offset by lower COVID-19 costs compared to last year. As seen on slide 29, adjusted gross profit margin declined 150 basis points, driven primarily by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the phase-in of our pricing actions. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 70 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth and the reduction in brand marketing, I just mentioned. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 80 basis points as we had expected. For the fiscal year, adjusted gross profit margin declined 140 basis points, primarily driven by the cost pressures we experienced in the second half of the year and the lag in pricing. Adjusted operating income grew 6% in constant currency, with the Consumer segment\u2019s adjusted operating income increasing 1% and the Flavor Solutions segment, 23%. Both segments were driven by higher sales and CCI led cost savings, partially offset by cost pressures and incremental strategic investment spending. Adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points for the fiscal year, driven by the adjusted gross profit margin decline. Turning to income taxes, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3%, compared to 22.9% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.1%, comparable to 19.9% in 2020. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5% for the full year. The elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest impacted both comparisons unfavorably. Our adjusted income from operations was also unfavorably impacted by the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern continents, following the sale of our minority stake earlier this year. For the fiscal year, this was partially offset by strong performance from our McCormick to Mexico joint venture. At the bottomline, as shown on slide 32, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.84 from $0.79 in the year ago period. And for the year, adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $3.05 for fiscal year 2021. The increases for both comparisons were driven by higher adjusted operating income attributable to strong sales growth. On slide 33, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $828 million. The decrease from last year was primarily due to the higher use of cash associated with working capital, and the payment of transaction and integration costs. The working capital comparison includes the impact of higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues, as well as buffer against cost volatility. We\u2019ve returned $363 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $278 million for capital expenditures in 2021. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. For example, our new U.K. Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility, our ERP business transformation, additional hot sauce capacity in the U.S. and our new U.S. Northeast Distribution Center. In 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2021, as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives, and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 34, we are well-positioned for another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. We are projecting strong topline and operating performance, with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the topline, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. As Lawrence mentioned, we are taking further pricing actions in 2022, and as a result, expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth. We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by our pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. Our 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19 related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid-teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. Our cost savings target reflects the challenges of realizing commodity and packaging cost savings in the current inflationary environment. Importantly, we believe there continues to be a long runway to achieve cost savings in 2022 and beyond. Based on the expected timing of certain items, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our additional 2022 pricing actions are expected to be phased in during the second quarter. Cost inflation will have a more significant impact in the first half of 2022, as cost pressures accelerated in the back half of last year. We also expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021. As a reminder, we are also lapping a very strong business performance in the first quarter of 2021. Our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating profit growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind, I just mentioned. This results in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22, compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. In summary, we are well-positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies to drive another year of strong growth and performance.\nLawrence Kurzius: Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 35. We drove record sales growth in 2021. Our strong operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. We achieved our one-year Cholula and FONA acquisition plans. Cholula and FONA have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures on driving growth, as we did in the fourth quarter. McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of the environment. We have a strong foundation, we are in attractive categories and we\u2019re capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks, everybody, and good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. I guess to start off, McCormick, is essentially guiding to an on algorithm year in what is obviously been described as a still pretty difficult industry-wide operating environment. I was hoping you could walk us through maybe some of the really the key puts and takes in a little more detail that provide you with the visibility to achieve this. And maybe what I am getting at is more detail on the dynamics still very much at play, as you mentioned some of them in your first quarter, I think basically, investors are trying to get a better handle on sort of the achievability of the full year in light of all of the difficult dynamics that are playing out in 1Q and just trying to get a sense of just how back end loaded the year is and your level of visibility there? So any more detail on that would be helpful.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks, Andrew. Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think anyone should be only surprised by the topline guidance. I think at the end of the third quarter, we indicated that we expect it to grow in 2022 and tried to indicate that we thought everyone\u2019s outlook for us was a bit pessimistic and you can see that we have a pretty upbeat view of where our sales are going. The underlying trends that support our business that we talked about in our prepared remarks are strong. The demand for flavor is not cyclical or obsolete or pandemic related, but it\u2019s under girded by real demographics with older generations, fueling that demand and we think that the consumption. The shift in consumption at-home that has happened in recent years is just a continuation of a long-term trend that supports our business from an underlying standpoint and all the things that we do in our strategies for brand building and so on continue to be supportive of growth. The year also includes a significant impact on the topline from pricing, which may be underestimated previously and so that\u2019s going to factor into it. I guess the shape of the year our fourth quarter is always the strongest part of the year. The first quarter is also always the smallest part and that may be compounded a bit this year by the fact that really the full impact of our pricing actions won\u2019t have gone into effect in the first quarter. The pricing actions that we took last year, of course, are in effect now, but the next round of pricing won\u2019t go into effect until, as we as through the second half -- until as we go through the second quarter and that\u2019s going to affect both the topline and the bottomline. I will pass it over to Mike now for some comments on operating profit.\nMike Smith: Yeah. Just to highlight a little bit to getting into that on sales in the first quarter, we\u2019re really comparing against a really strong first quarter of last year, where consumer was up really dramatically. So there\u2019s going to be a bit of a segment mix challenge in the first quarter. Talking about the first half also cost -- as pricing will grow during the year, costs though, which we talked about in mid-teens increase will be in effect in the first quarter. There will be a tough comparison there too, because the pricing won\u2019t offset that. If you remember back to last year, we had low single-digit inflation earlier in last year that rose to the high single-digit at the end of the year, now at mid single-teens that\u2019s a tough comp for the first quarter primarily and a bit of the first half. The other thing we have also is the ERP spend we talked about and we can talk about that later a little bit. But the timing of that -- last year we had some minimal spending in Q1 also. So a bunch of drivers that we think the profit will be back loaded in the year would be a bit of a tough comp in Q1.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. And then, I guess, lastly, with mid-teens inflation expected for the full year, sort of would suggest maybe, call it, high single-digit pricing would be needed to sort of protect profit dollars. And I guess that would imply maybe closer to maybe a mid single-digit decline in volume for the year. Is that kind of broadly the right way to think about the balance and what does that suggest in terms of elasticity and sort of comparing to historic levels? I think you mentioned, you\u2019re building in some elasticity, of course, as more pricing kicks in, but maybe not to the extent that you\u2019ve seen historically. If you could just give us a sense of what\u2019s driving that thought process?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. Sure. Andrew, I think that you got the -- you\u2019ve got the -- at a high level, the shape right, but maybe too extreme on the end. I think that characterize pricing, including the wrap from last year, to be more in the mid-to-high range and more of for the volume impact at a total company level to be more flattish to low single-digit decline. We have modeled in elasticity, but not at the rates that we have seen historically. I do think that we\u2019re in new and uncharted territory versus all of the elasticity models, at least from the actions that we\u2019ve taken so far. We assumed lower price elasticity and that what we seem to be experiencing, if anything, we may be seeing slightly even less elasticity than we\u2019ve assumed. But we\u2019re conscious that with more than one price increase coming in a relatively short timeframe that there may be a cumulative effect. So we have modeled it price elasticity. Mike, do you want to elaborate on that at all, if you have anything to add?\nMike Smith: No. I think you covered it well.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much everybody.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Ken.\nKen Goldman: Good morning. Oh! Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks so much. You\u2019re guiding to operating profit growing 200 basis points faster than sales, which is, of course, normal as per year ago. But I think typically, you might expect gross margins to be a positive driver towards that and this year, they might be a slight negative. So, I guess, the burden to grow operating profit falls harder on SG&A savings or leverage than usual this year. And I kind of just wanted to quickly go over the drivers of your confidence that SG&A can be this helpful. I mean, we do have marketing growing at a slower pace than sales, I appreciate that, and you, of course, have lower COVID costs there. But I was under the impression you would also have maybe ERP implementation cost kind of offsetting those COVID cost reductions. You did mention CCI savings will be less of a tailwind. So forgive the lengthy question, but I am just not quite sure I get why operating income will be up so much unless there\u2019s something in the SG&A efficiencies that I am just quite not getting yet. So thank you for that.\nLawrence Kurzius: That\u2019s a good question, Ken. I will start off. You highlighted exactly what we\u2019re seeing. A&P is up low-single digits, continuing to invest in the business. Other SG&A is kind of flattish if you think about it. In a high -- we gave our CCI number and in a year where CCI is down versus the previous year, because of the toughness of getting through CCI reductions and things like packaging costs and commodity costs. In SG&A, there\u2019s -- we\u2019re driving hard on SG&A from a CCI perspective, so you should see positives there. COVID cost didn\u2019t only hit the gross margin line. There were COVID costs in the distribution side of things, which will go away in 2022. We\u2019re taking discretionary actions to really in a high cost environment. We\u2019re doing the prudent things to make sure we can make our numbers. And I would say things like incentive comp, we\u2019ve had two really strong years of that and we budget towards hitting our targets and we would love to exceed it, but that is a part of the comparison too also.\nKen Goldman: I hope your personal\u2026\nMike Smith: With the\u2026\nKen Goldman: Go ahead.\nMike Smith: Yeah. I will step on there, too. With the high topline growth and the flattish SG&A, that even with the gross margin flat to slightly down in that range. It\u2019s kind of -- you\u2019re going to get operating leverage that\u2019s going to drop through.\nKen Goldman: Yes. No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, quickly, I wondered if you can update us, maybe you said it and I didn\u2019t quite hear it. But where your customer inventories stand today as you estimate them to be versus what might be considered normal. And if your outlook to any extent, it assumes that any kind of inventory refill takes place this year. I know we\u2019ve been waiting for something like this for all of our companies for a long time.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah.\nKen Goldman: I am just curious what you\u2019re modeling there?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, we have not restocked our customers to the extent that we would have hoped in 2021. We have started to make some progress on that and then we run into the same kind of supply chain disruptions at many of our peers and others and other industries have talked about. And so, we actually pulled down customer inventories again in Q3, and in Q4, with the high elevated demand, even though our supply chain was in much better condition, we were really able to ship to the consumption rather than lease stocks. So we think that there\u2019s still some restocking of customer inventories that still to be done. I mean your own experience would probably tell you that if conditions still aren\u2019t perfect, the backrooms and distribution channels, likewise, still have some gaps. So there\u2019s still more work to do in that area.\nKen Goldman: I live in New York City. The state of grocery stores here is always at a low level. So it\u2019s kind of hard to tell what\u2019s bad versus what\u2019s normal. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. Right. Sure. I will say is that, I don\u2019t want those comments to be misunderstood. I think that we saw a peak disruption of our supply chain in Q4 and we\u2019ve seen steady improvement since then. Some of the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from our larger customers is that we\u2019re in much better shape than some of our peer companies.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. One follow-up for Mike, is it fair to say that your COVID costs will be a benefit in 2022 of $60 million just comparing to $21 million? And then how do I compare that to ERP costs, are your ERP costs going to be higher in 2022 compared to 2021? Can you give us a rough estimate? And then, secondly, on private label, if you look back into history, private label does gain a lot of share during inflationary periods, especially in your category. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen from your customers demand for private label heading into 2022 and how do you expect it to perform in 2022 in a rising price environment?\nMike Smith: Rob, I will take the first part of that, and Lawrence, take the second. First, great question, COVID cost and ERP are big drivers on our P&L. COVID costs, we did talk about how two years ago, we spent $50 million, last year $60 million. If you remember, we highlighted a large chunk of that was co-packing cost. So as we come out, our supply chain has improved over last year in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve eliminated most of those costs. But we still have underlying costs that, frankly, we\u2019re not treating as COVID cost anymore. We\u2019re treating as an ongoing business cost of labor, premium pay, things like that. They are going to continue into the future. So, that -- I am not going to give you an exact number. It\u2019s not $60 million. The significant part of that is going away in \u201822. Relating to ERP, if you remember from our third quarter call last year, we were talking about it at the time, a decrease in COVID costs in -- we expected a decrease in COVID costs in 2022 offset by an increase in the ERP costs. That being said, what we\u2019re saying now is and our -- we\u2019re still spending significant amounts on ERP in 2022. We spent -- we had talked last year about spending in 2021 around $50 million. 2021 came in a little heavier than that and in 2022, we\u2019re going to -- it\u2019s not a significant headwind, but it\u2019s still a significant investment. I\u2019d say it\u2019s up slightly. It wasn\u2019t big enough to mention in our guidance. Now what has changed since three months ago? One, elevated and strong demand. We\u2019re really happy with that demand. As we went through our planning process, which we always do in the fall, the combination of that elevated demand, and as you know, our fourth quarter is really important to us and we have planned on significant go-lives in 2022. One, to protect our customer service and to make sure we are prudent. The go-lives would have slid into the fourth quarter because you have to build inventories and things like that to get ready for these major go-lives. We made the decision to slide those major go-lives out into 2023. The end result of all those moves is roughly between 2021, 2022 and 2023, it\u2019s about the same level of spend. So it\u2019s very smooth. It kind of eliminates that noise between years, which help you look at our underlying growth of operating profit over that time. But we\u2019re still really excited about the ERP investment, but we just made the decision, as I just talked about.\nRobert Moskow: Right. Got it. Okay.\nLawrence Kurzius: Regarding your second question, Rob. So far, first of all, for the last couple of years, private label has actually underperformed in the category. You even heard on our remarks that although our fourth quarter was strong, the private label portion of it was actually not a contributor to that strength. And we\u2019re really not seeing consumers move to private label in our categories, and in fact, it\u2019s really moved more to brands than to private label. And past times when there\u2019s been a recessionary environment and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re expecting a recession in 2022. But even in tough times that were more economically tough, our products have done very well, our products contribute pennies, a fraction of the cost of the meal are actually part of the consumer\u2019s way to manage their total inflation basket. I mean if meat is going up 40%, one way you can stretch your grocery dollar is to buy less expensive cuts and use more on  spices and our recipe goes. So actually we tend to do pretty well both in good and bad economic times, and I am confident that we\u2019ve got a portfolio of products that touches the consumer at every price point. I know in our internal discussions around pricing, we\u2019ve been very conscious of the lower income consumers and how to make sure that we\u2019re still able to meet their needs for flavor.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Adam.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: So, I guess, my first question maybe is around the fourth quarter and really turning to the Flavor Solutions business. And I guess, the operating profit and margin performance in that business, it contracted pretty sharply with consumer and I know this is a big consumer quarter. But maybe if you could just talk about some of the profit and margin drivers in Flavor Solutions in the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe in the 2022 outlook, how we should think about the relative segment performance between Consumer and Flavor Solutions versus your total company earning?\nMike Smith: Hey, Adam. This is Mike. I will take that. Yeah. In fourth quarter, Flavor Solutions did have a bit of margin pressure. I mean, similar to consumer, obviously, the cost last year came ahead of our pricing actions. So that did -- obviously that impacted Flavor Solutions. But as we catch up into the first quarter and second quarter, that should be solved. But they did increase very quickly for us. I mean there\u2019s pass-throughs contractual agreements, so there\u2019s timing elements to a lot of our Flavor Solutions business. That thing being said, one of the -- you\u2019ve seen also the great volume growth and sales growth we\u2019ve had in Flavor Solutions over the past couple of years, and we\u2019re making strategic investments such as the U.K. flavor manufacturing plant. Those investments have costs associated with them. So in the fourth quarter, as we\u2019re starting to bring that plant live into next year and you should expect in early 2022, also a bit of a drag early in the year of Flavor Solutions you will see a bit of that due to the strategic investments of which the U.K. flavor manufacturing plant is just one. And we did have a little bit of unfavorable mix in the quarter, even though we were pruning -- continue to prune some of our lower margin business, there was a bit of a hard comparison versus 4Q of last year.\nLawrence Kurzius: I will say if there\u2019s an area where we still have some ongoing, I\u2019d say, extraordinary costs, I\u2019d say Flavor Solutions might be a little bit more impacted by that, where we\u2019ve had -- just because of supply chain disruption and workforce disruption where we\u2019ve had a bit more incremental cost for things like overtime premium pay and so forth.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then maybe just continuing in Flavor Solutions, if I am thinking about as part of the bridge in 2022, right, the company level, being tight on SG&A is clearly a key element of hitting the total company profit growth targets. In contrast in Flavor Solutions, a big part of the growth has been to remix the portfolio up into some of these higher value segments, which obviously come with higher gross margins, but also typically will have a higher SG&A burden in terms of the R&D and the technical sales associated with that. Just are you still able to make both the facility and the headcount investments necessary on the Flavor Solutions side to support those -- the growth there?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, definitely. I mean, I think, as I alluded, we\u2019re making those investments and there will be timing impacts, like I said, first half a bit with some of these investments for some of our strategic things. But we recovered those things by the end of the year and we feel very good about the ability. And acquisitions like phone up continue and the growth profile of those businesses give us more confidence over time of the positivity of those investments to Flavor Solutions.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay.\nMike Smith: And I will remind everybody, our Flavor Solutions tend to be a bit lumpy as well, driven by the activities of some of our large customers.\nAdam Samuelson: Got it. That\u2019s all helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Thank you. Good morning. I have just a couple of questions for you. I was just curious, the level of inflation that we\u2019re seeing this year kind of mid-teens inflation was more than I expected and I just wanted to get a sense of how much was it in 2021, what were you kind of up against this past year, just to get a sense of the kind of total amount of inflation? And then also just to understand, I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve heard it about, is there any more inflation in Flavor Solutions versus Consumers or one that\u2019s going to require more pricing as we move through the year?\nMike Smith: Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Mike. I will answer that. I mean, last year we started out the year, as you remember, low-single digits and we transitioned into mid-single digits around -- I think around the third quarter call. In the fourth quarter call, we talked about the fourth quarter costs were up high-single digits, which made the whole year high end of the mid single-digit range\u2026\nChris Growe: Okay.\nMike Smith: \u2026at least, I am saying it, so just to remind you where we were. This year is the mid-teens really driven by large commodity packaging and freight increases that we\u2019ve all seen. From a Flavor Solutions versus Consumer, they\u2019re both impacted by all this. I mean, ocean freight, which is a big item for us because as you think about our peers, we get a lot of our products from Asia, other parts of the world where shipping containers and things like that. That ocean cost has gone up a lot. That impacts both the Consumer and the Flavor Solutions very equitably. Other items like pepper, garlic, things like that, we use on both sides. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s roughly the same overall materially.\nChris Growe: Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And the other question I had was just in -- you talked a little bit before, I think, it was to Rob\u2019s question about third-party -- using third parties to manufacture your products and that kind of thing. It sounds like you\u2019ve gotten out of a lot of that and I know that was a gross margin drag throughout the past couple of years and I think a lot of what you call COVID cost. So, just to be clear, that\u2019s something that will largely go away in 2022? And I guess related to that\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah.\nChris Growe: Well, go ahead, go ahead.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. It\u2019s the incremental portion that\u2019s going to go away. We always have a certain example of that\u2026\nChris Growe: Okay.\nLawrence Kurzius: I mean that makes sense\u2026\nChris Growe: Yeah.\nLawrence Kurzius: \u2026 for our business for a variety of reasons. I would say, let\u2019s say, more in line with the historical level of co-packing is that incremental co-packing and at a time when everybody was looking for the capacity that was -- that created all of those premium costs that we absorb ourselves and which we\u2019ve gotten out of the business.\nChris Growe: Okay. I guess what I am hopefully getting to is, I guess, then, is -- are you able to produce at the level of demand growth today? That\u2019s something that every company has been struggling with and I am just curious kind of where McCormick stands on that now. I guess as you pull back on these incremental third parties are indicating, you do have the internal capacity to meet demand, is that right?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. That is right, Chris. And I would say that the challenge has always been in the Americas, first of all. So we\u2019ve been able to meet the demand throughout the entire pandemic in the rest of the world. It\u2019s been an Americas demand. We\u2019re just between the scale of the business and the sheer elevation of demand. And the fact that our capital investments had for the previous number of years been directed towards building capacity overseas, that left us a little under invested in the U.S. It gave us a real challenge in the early days of the pandemic. But we\u2019ve done an enormous amount of work to increase our U.S. manufacturing capacity and confident that we\u2019ve got the capacity to meet that demand. That\u2019s why that co-packing expense has gone away. That\u2019s a root of the improvement in our service to our customers, the restoration of product on the shelf, the recovery of share. This -- our supply chain has always been a competitive advantage from global sourcing to operating excellence. And I\u2019d say that, although, it will never be good enough to my satisfaction, has come a long way, and I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a competitive advantage again.\nChris Growe: Okay.\nMike Smith: So we continue to work with our vendors. We struggle with the same challenges that all of our peers have with supplying bottles and things like that and there will be sporadic challenges along the way, but not broad based.\nChris Growe: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for all your time.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nPeter Galbo: Mike, I guess, we\u2019re getting some questions this morning just on trying to square the gross margin guidance, just given the level of cost inflation. I know you spoke about ocean freight and commodities. I guess, one, is that cost inflation line just only pertinent to cost of goods, does it include outbound freight, which I think you guys captured in SG&A and maybe how we should think about just the cadence of gross margin throughout the course of the year?\nMike Smith: Well, first, outbound freight is considered cost of goods sold for us. So we\u2019re similar to our peers. I mean, if you look at our gross margin, we\u2019re guiding comparable to down 50 basis points. The whole impact of pricing mid single-teens inflation is a big drag on that. So we\u2019re thinking of a 250 basis point dilution just because of pricing to cover costs. From a timing -- but that\u2019s offset, the good positives are CCI savings continuing to prove lower margin business and the COVID costs we\u2019ve talked about previously. Next year has a little bit of a segment mix headwind as you know. And -- but I\u2019d say from a timing perspective, as we talked about, the timing of our pricing coming in the second pricing come impact in the second quarter. It will build during the year cost, which will be with us the full year, so the first quarter will be heavily impacted as we talked about and the first half, a bit of that too, so it\u2019s a bit of a first half, second half play as we\u2019ve talked about from a gross margin perspective.\nLawrence Kurzius: I will also just chime in that we have great brands that we invest behind in most of our categories in most of our markets. We\u2019re not only the share of voice leader in terms of speaking to the consumer, but in many cases, we have close to 100% of the shareholder voice. We\u2019ve got a great position on the shelf. We\u2019ve done a lot to build loyalty with consumers, keep our brands relevant and we believe that we\u2019ve got the pricing power to pass these costs through and continue to drive growth in the future beyond that.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. And Lawrence, maybe just a separate question, I know there\u2019s nothing in the at least initial outlook as it relates to M&A. But I think there\u2019s been some headlines, obviously, about some potential brands that could be nice adjacencies for you guys that could come to market. Just how you\u2019re thinking about M&A this year, where maybe you think the target leverage ratio needs to be before you think about taking on another deal? Thanks very much guys.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, there have certainly been some exciting headlines in what it\u2019s supposed to be a boring industry. So there is a lot going on out there. Yeah, I would say that, we always are alert to strategic assets and to which we apply our financial discipline. We got a great track record of buying great assets and integrating them. We\u2019re still coming off a fairly recent acquisition of two very good assets, Cholula and FONA that have performed very well for us, but that we still got paid for and so right now our primary focus is on deleveraging and building more dry powder. I won\u2019t -- I am not going to say never, but that\u2019s our primary focus right now.\nPeter Galbo: Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Hi. Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. So just to clarify, look, as we go through 2020 and obviously, fiscal 2021, rate demand has been strong for in-home baking. You benefited, obviously. I mean, it seems like, as you said, kind of in the call that, elasticity models are probably a little bit all over the place, just kind of given where we are in terms of strength in consumer and increasing prices. So, I mean, it sounds like your perspective from here is that consumption level, even with an increase in price and potentially, let\u2019s say, an increase in our ability as we get through the year, really shouldn\u2019t be kind of waning that much, right, like the feel demographically with the incremental purchase rate, let\u2019s say, repeat from millennials that even if prices go up, maybe private label doesn\u2019t take them a share and kind of overall demand seems to be somewhat stable. I just kind of want to get clarification on that demand piece just given mobility and trade down risk. That\u2019s all.\nLawrence Kurzius: Okay. Well, I mean taking this as the primarily very U.S.-centric question. But we do expect that the shift in consumption to more cooking at-home and that consumer behavior to stick to an extent. We\u2019ve never said that all of it\u2019s going to stay. But we do expect that a significant portion of that is going to stay and that this has been a step-up in our category. I mean consumers are still working from home and it looks like work from home is going to be a permanent part of the work environment. Our own proprietary research with consumers say that only a tiny fraction, I mean, less than 10% expect to cook less at-home than they do now, most expect to cook more. And so based on what we see happening in society, the -- what consumers are saying and but we are still experiencing from elevated demand and says that demand is going to continue to be strong. And I would just say also that we are in categories that we\u2019ve chosen to be in that are strong to begin with and there\u2019s been strong underlying growth of all of the flavor categories that we\u2019re in over time. And the increment that has happened from the shift in consumption during the last two years really has accelerated growth by maybe a year or two of those categories. So it\u2019s not as extraordinary as everyone thinks, I just have that much to follow on.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s fair. And then, quickly, just Mike, just on free cash flow. I think, you said, you expect it to be up year-over-year kind of a good strong free cash flow year. CapEx seems to be up a little bit year-over-year however and then we sold free cash flow kind of down a little bit last year relative to the prior, call it, three years, four years. So just when you say kind of good strong free cash flow year that, obviously, you\u2019re implying it\u2019s up year-over-year, but maybe it\u2019s a little bit more in line with the prior few years. Just trying to get a little bit more sense of clarity on kind of how you\u2019re viewing free cash flow. That\u2019s it. Thanks.\nMike Smith: Yeah. I think that\u2019s fair, Rob. I think, this year, with the significant build in inventories to protect our customers and sales, some of the transaction costs we talked about earlier in the year from M&A has a little drag on that. But as we see into the future, some of those things get solved, so back to previous year levels, it makes sense.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Great. Thanks so much.\nMike Smith: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and reach of our balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. I am incredibly proud of McCormick\u2019s 2021 accomplishments. We drove strong performance while remaining focused on growth, committed to people and driven by purpose during another dynamic year. We\u2019re disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We are continuing to accelerate our momentum and drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well-positioned for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your time this morning.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks to, everybody, for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions regarding today\u2019s information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes this morning\u2019s call.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on slide four, our fourth quarter completed another year of robust and sustained growth. In 2021, we remained focused on growth, performance and people, driving another year of strong results and continuing our momentum. We drove record sales growth by executing on our long-term strategies, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities, all while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing global environment. The profit driven by our strong sales growth in 2021, while tempered by the well-known headwinds of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges was also strong. Our 2021 operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures and did so again in the fourth quarter, and we expect to do the same through this inflationary environment using pricing and other levers to fully offset cost pressures over time. The breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio ideally position us to fully knowing demand for flavor around the world and drive continued differentiated growth. This has never been more evident than over the last two years as consumers adapted to the ever-changing environment. Our compelling offerings in our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segment for every retail and customer strategy across all channels create a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive growth and consistency in our performance. It also gives us significant flexibility to adapt to changing conditions wherever they may arise and continue on our growth trajectory. This is a significant differentiator in the dynamic environment in which we currently operate. We are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion regardless of whether the occasion is consumed at-home or away-from-home through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor. Now turning to slide six and our fourth quarter results, our performance was at the high end of the guidance range we provided for sales and adjusted operating profit on our last earnings call and exceeded the guidance range we provided for adjusted earnings per share. On our topline versus the year ago period, we grew fourth quarter sales 11%. Both of our segments delivered strong growth with contributions from base business growth, driven by higher volume and pricing actions, as well as new products and acquisitions. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share both increased 6%, driven by growth from higher sales and CCI led cost savings, partially offset by cost inflation. Let's turn to our fourth quarter segment business performance, which includes some comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which we believe are meaningful given the level of demand volatility from quarter-to-quarter experienced in 2020. Starting on slide seven, Consumer segment sales grew 10%, including incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition. The increase was driven by strong volume growth and the impact of pricing actions phased in during the quarter as we discussed on our last earnings call. Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpace its pre-pandemic level. Our Americas sales growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI Consumption Data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 1%, following a 17% consumption increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a two-year basis. As we previously discussed in the year ago period, elevated demand challenged our supply chain were as in 2021, but the actions we took to add capacity and increase resilience, we were far better positioned and able to ship in line with consumption. Demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving, as is our share performance, with another sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, as we expected. We continue to see further improvement in our recent performance as we begin 2022. Importantly, and as I just mentioned, we are better positioned than we were a year ago, and are confident in our continued momentum. Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the fourth quarter of 2019 was the seventh consecutive quarter that our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the two-year ago period. Our key categories also continued to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the two-year ago period. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. And when consumers shop they are buying and therefore using more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. Now turning to EMEA, during the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we gained market share in key categories and across the region. Similar to the U.S., our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two-year-ago period and when consumers shop, they are buying more than they were pre-pandemic. And in the Asia-Pacific region, our fourth quarter performance continued to reflect the recovery of China's lower branded food service sales last year, as well as consumer consumption growth across the region. Turning to slide nine, our Flavor Solutions segment grew 14%, reflecting higher base volume growth in new products, as well as pricing actions to partially offset cost inflation, and contributions from FONA and Cholula acquisitions. On a two-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions. In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our fourth quarter growth. Additionally, we continue to see robust growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers, as well as the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers as more dining out options are open versus a year ago. We continue to execute on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products in the region, both through the addition of FONA and Cholula to our portfolio, as well as the exit of some lower margin business. Turning to EMEA, which has continued its strong momentum, we are winning in all channels with double-digit fourth quarter growth to quick service restaurants or QSRs, branded food service customers and packaged food and beverage customers. Recovery has been robust in the away-from-home part of the portfolio and growth in our at-home offerings has been outstanding. Notably, for the full year, on a two-year basis, we have driven 19% constant currency growth across the portfolio. In APZ, our momentum with our QSR customers remains strong, driving double-digit growth versus 2020, as well as on a two-year basis. As for the fourth quarter and in line with what we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Moving to our fourth quarter results, I am pleased to share highlights of our full fiscal year, including an update on our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, starting on slide 10. We drove record sales growth in 2021, growing sales 13% to $6.3 billion with strong organic sales growth and a 4% contribution from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. Notably, on a two-year basis, we grew sales 18%, reflecting a robust and sustained growth momentum in both of our segments. Our Consumer segment sales growth of 9% was driven by consumer sustained preference for cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, strong digital engagement and new products, as well as growth from Cholula. Versus 2019 we grew sales 20%, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands. Our Flavor Solutions segment growth of 19% reflected the strong continued momentum with the at-home products in our portfolio, including a record year of new product growth and a robust recovery from last year's lower demand for away-from-home products, as well as contributions from FONA and Cholula. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and away-from-home products in our portfolio. On a two-year basis, we grew sales 15%, driven by the at-home part of our portfolio, the demand for the away-from-home portion recovering to pre-pandemic levels. We have consistently driven industry-leading sales growth resulting in McCormick being named to the latest Fortune 500. We're proud of our sustained performance and for being included in this prestigious group of industry-leading companies. At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our 36th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Finally, we continue to be recognized for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During the year, McCormick was named the United Nations Global Compact Lead Company and awarded the inaugural Terra Carta Seal from his royal highness of price of oil, our industry leadership in creating a sustainable future. And just last week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2022 Global 100 Sustainability Index as the world's 14th most sustainable corporation and for the sixth consecutive year number one in the food products sector. Moving to the one-year anniversary of our two fantastic recent acquisitions, Cholula and FONA are creating value, achieving synergies and delivering results according to our plans. Importantly, we've achieved our one-year sales and earnings per share accretion expectations for both Cholula and FONA. I'd like to share some comments about the successful execution of our growth plans and then in a few moments, Mike, will cover in more detail our delivery on acquisition plans. Starting with Cholula on slide 12, the addition of this beloved iconic brand with authentic Mexican flavor is accelerating the growth of our global condiment platform. In our Consumer segment, we're unlocking Cholula's significant growth potential by using our category management expertise, leveraging e-commerce investments, launching new products and optimizing brand marketing spend. We executed on initiatives this past year, including optimizing shelf placement and assortment, expanding into new channels, gaining momentum in e-commerce, where Cholula had been underpenetrated, increasing awareness, both through brand marketing investments and brand partnerships such as with DoorDash and leveraging promotional scale across McCormick brands. We are excited about the results our initiatives are yielding. During 2021, we gained significant momentum on top of lapping elevated growth in 2020, adding new households and growing Cholula's consumption 13% in 2021 versus last year. Cholula is continuing to outpace category growth and gain share, combined with 19% total distribution point growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, it is clear our plans are driving accelerated growth. And notably, we drove Cholula to the number two hot sauce brand in the U.S., joining Frank's RedHot, the number one ranked brand at the top of the category. We are just as excited about Cholula's performance as part of our Flavor Solutions portfolio. With our broad presence across foodservice channel, we have strengthened Cholula's go-to-market model through 2021. We continue to build on Cholula's strong front-of-house presence, which builds trial and brand awareness beyond food service, with significant double-digit growth of portion control packs as more restaurant meals are now consumed as delivery or takeaway. Leveraging our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, we've also driven double-digit growth in our back-of-house foodservice penetration through recipe inspiration and increasing Cholula's menu participation. We are growing with big national accounts and smaller independent restaurants, as well as expanding distribution through leveraging the strength of our distributor relationships where Cholula was less developed. We are succeeding with new menu items, including both permanent ones and limited time offers. Our momentum with Cholula is very strong, and we are confident our initiatives will continue to build on consumer's growing passion for heat and drive further growth of this fantastic brand. Now turning to FONA, the addition of this leading North American flavor manufacturer is accelerating the growth of our global flavors platform. We are thrilled our first year of owning FONA has been a record year for the business with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category continued to drive significant growth for FONA up 15% compared to last year. FONA's new product wins and its pipeline potential have also hit record high fueling future growth. We are continuing to drive growth and create new opportunities with our global footprint. We are leveraging GEODIS infrastructure to expand FONA's flavors into the EMEA region. In our APZ region, the combination of our infrastructure, which includes our recent flavor capability investments to China and FONA's local application and flavor creation talent is unlocking further potential to accelerate flavor growth in that region. And just a few months ago, we began our expansion of FONA's footprint to increase our Americas flavor manufacturing capacity, an investment we planned as part of our acquisition model, enabling us to deliver the future growth we expect. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale, as well as increasing our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our collective customers with a more comprehensive product offering and fueling more opportunities for growth across our entire portfolio. We are cross-selling products across benefit of our combination within our own portfolio. For instance, with FONA now leveraging McCormick's USDA savory flavors and developing flavors for pet food applications. The combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to participate on briefs that capitalize on core strength across McCormick and FONA, enabling us to build a robust pipeline of opportunities, and importantly, win and grow with our customers. We are thrilled with both Cholula and FONA. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions, as well as our confidence that we will continue to achieve our plan, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only continued to strengthen. In summary, for 2021 we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment and the at-home part of our Flavor Solutions segment. We have successfully navigated through the pandemic-related disruption in the away-from-home portion of our Flavor Solutions segment and Cholula and FONA have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. All of this reinforces our confidence for continued growth in 2022. The global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great, fast growing categories and will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and favorable cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies, sustainably positions us for future growth. In this current dynamic and fast paced environment, we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges similar to the rest of the industry. To partially offset rising costs, we raised prices where appropriately last year and began to realize the impact of those actions in our fourth quarter sales growth. As costs have continued to accelerate, we are raising prices again where appropriate in 2022. These pricing actions are on track and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have grown and compounded our growth regardless of short-term pressures and plan to do so again in 2022, as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. Across our Consumer segment, our 2022 plans include continuing to build consumer's confidence in the kitchen, inspire their home cooking and flavor exploration, and accelerate flavored usage, including delivering on the global demand for heat. We also plan to strengthen our consumer relationships at every point of purchase, as well as create delicious, healthy and sustainable future. In our investments in brand marketing, category management and new products, we expect to drive further sales growth. For our Flavor Solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2022. Our plans include targeting opportunities to grow with our customers at attractive high growth categories, continuing to leverage our broad technology platform to develop clean and natural solutions that taste great and strengthening our leadership in heat. For the culinary inspired innovation and our passion for creating a flawless customer experience, we plan to continue our new product momentum and drive further sales growth. Our achievements in 2021, our effective growth strategies, as well as our robust operating momentum, all bolster our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. We're looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2022 growth plan in just a few weeks at CAGNY. In summary, we have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate through this ever-changing environment, responding with agility to volatility and disruptions, while remaining focused on our long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. A combination of our strong business model, the investments we've made, the capabilities we've built and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through topline growth and margin expansion. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick's employees around the world have done a tremendous job of navigating this past year's volatile environment. Their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor drive our momentum and success and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 35. We drove record sales growth in 2021. Our strong operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. We achieved our one-year Cholula and FONA acquisition plans. Cholula and FONA have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures on driving growth, as we did in the fourth quarter. McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of the environment. We have a strong foundation, we are in attractive categories and we're capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to your questions. Good morning Andrew. Great. Thanks, Andrew. Well, first of all, I don't think anyone should be only surprised by the topline guidance. I think at the end of the third quarter, we indicated that we expect it to grow in 2022 and tried to indicate that we thought everyone's outlook for us was a bit pessimistic and you can see that we have a pretty upbeat view of where our sales are going. The underlying trends that support our business that we talked about in our prepared remarks are strong. The demand for flavor is not cyclical or obsolete or pandemic related, but it's under girded by real demographics with older generations, fueling that demand and we think that the consumption. The shift in consumption at-home that has happened in recent years is just a continuation of a long-term trend that supports our business from an underlying standpoint and all the things that we do in our strategies for brand building and so on continue to be supportive of growth. The year also includes a significant impact on the topline from pricing, which may be underestimated previously and so that's going to factor into it. I guess the shape of the year our fourth quarter is always the strongest part of the year. The first quarter is also always the smallest part and that may be compounded a bit this year by the fact that really the full impact of our pricing actions won't have gone into effect in the first quarter. The pricing actions that we took last year, of course, are in effect now, but the next round of pricing won't go into effect until, as we as through the second half -- until as we go through the second quarter and that's going to affect both the topline and the bottomline. I will pass it over to Mike now for some comments on operating profit. Yeah. Sure. Andrew, I think that you got the -- you've got the -- at a high level, the shape right, but maybe too extreme on the end. I think that characterize pricing, including the wrap from last year, to be more in the mid-to-high range and more of for the volume impact at a total company level to be more flattish to low single-digit decline. We have modeled in elasticity, but not at the rates that we have seen historically. I do think that we're in new and uncharted territory versus all of the elasticity models, at least from the actions that we've taken so far. We assumed lower price elasticity and that what we seem to be experiencing, if anything, we may be seeing slightly even less elasticity than we've assumed. But we're conscious that with more than one price increase coming in a relatively short timeframe that there may be a cumulative effect. So we have modeled it price elasticity. Mike, do you want to elaborate on that at all, if you have anything to add? Hi, Ken. That's a good question, Ken. I will start off. You highlighted exactly what we're seeing. A&P is up low-single digits, continuing to invest in the business. Other SG&A is kind of flattish if you think about it. In a high -- we gave our CCI number and in a year where CCI is down versus the previous year, because of the toughness of getting through CCI reductions and things like packaging costs and commodity costs. In SG&A, there's -- we're driving hard on SG&A from a CCI perspective, so you should see positives there. COVID cost didn't only hit the gross margin line. There were COVID costs in the distribution side of things, which will go away in 2022. We're taking discretionary actions to really in a high cost environment. We're doing the prudent things to make sure we can make our numbers. And I would say things like incentive comp, we've had two really strong years of that and we budget towards hitting our targets and we would love to exceed it, but that is a part of the comparison too also. Yeah. Well, we have not restocked our customers to the extent that we would have hoped in 2021. We have started to make some progress on that and then we run into the same kind of supply chain disruptions at many of our peers and others and other industries have talked about. And so, we actually pulled down customer inventories again in Q3, and in Q4, with the high elevated demand, even though our supply chain was in much better condition, we were really able to ship to the consumption rather than lease stocks. So we think that there's still some restocking of customer inventories that still to be done. I mean your own experience would probably tell you that if conditions still aren't perfect, the backrooms and distribution channels, likewise, still have some gaps. So there's still more work to do in that area. Yeah. Right. Sure. I will say is that, I don't want those comments to be misunderstood. I think that we saw a peak disruption of our supply chain in Q4 and we've seen steady improvement since then. Some of the feedback we've gotten from our larger customers is that we're in much better shape than some of our peer companies. Regarding your second question, Rob. So far, first of all, for the last couple of years, private label has actually underperformed in the category. You even heard on our remarks that although our fourth quarter was strong, the private label portion of it was actually not a contributor to that strength. And we're really not seeing consumers move to private label in our categories, and in fact, it's really moved more to brands than to private label. And past times when there's been a recessionary environment and I don't know that we're expecting a recession in 2022. But even in tough times that were more economically tough, our products have done very well, our products contribute pennies, a fraction of the cost of the meal are actually part of the consumer's way to manage their total inflation basket. I mean if meat is going up 40%, one way you can stretch your grocery dollar is to buy less expensive cuts and use more on  spices and our recipe goes. So actually we tend to do pretty well both in good and bad economic times, and I am confident that we've got a portfolio of products that touches the consumer at every price point. I know in our internal discussions around pricing, we've been very conscious of the lower income consumers and how to make sure that we're still able to meet their needs for flavor. Good morning, Adam. I will say if there's an area where we still have some ongoing, I'd say, extraordinary costs, I'd say Flavor Solutions might be a little bit more impacted by that, where we've had -- just because of supply chain disruption and workforce disruption where we've had a bit more incremental cost for things like overtime premium pay and so forth. Well, definitely. I mean, I think, as I alluded, we're making those investments and there will be timing impacts, like I said, first half a bit with some of these investments for some of our strategic things. But we recovered those things by the end of the year and we feel very good about the ability. And acquisitions like phone up continue and the growth profile of those businesses give us more confidence over time of the positivity of those investments to Flavor Solutions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the incremental portion that's going to go away. We always have a certain example of that... I mean that makes sense... ... for our business for a variety of reasons. I would say, let's say, more in line with the historical level of co-packing is that incremental co-packing and at a time when everybody was looking for the capacity that was -- that created all of those premium costs that we absorb ourselves and which we've gotten out of the business. Yeah. That is right, Chris. And I would say that the challenge has always been in the Americas, first of all. So we've been able to meet the demand throughout the entire pandemic in the rest of the world. It's been an Americas demand. We're just between the scale of the business and the sheer elevation of demand. And the fact that our capital investments had for the previous number of years been directed towards building capacity overseas, that left us a little under invested in the U.S. It gave us a real challenge in the early days of the pandemic. But we've done an enormous amount of work to increase our U.S. manufacturing capacity and confident that we've got the capacity to meet that demand. That's why that co-packing expense has gone away. That's a root of the improvement in our service to our customers, the restoration of product on the shelf, the recovery of share. This -- our supply chain has always been a competitive advantage from global sourcing to operating excellence. And I'd say that, although, it will never be good enough to my satisfaction, has come a long way, and I'd say, it's a competitive advantage again. Great. Thanks. Good morning. I will also just chime in that we have great brands that we invest behind in most of our categories in most of our markets. We're not only the share of voice leader in terms of speaking to the consumer, but in many cases, we have close to 100% of the shareholder voice. We've got a great position on the shelf. We've done a lot to build loyalty with consumers, keep our brands relevant and we believe that we've got the pricing power to pass these costs through and continue to drive growth in the future beyond that. Well, there have certainly been some exciting headlines in what it's supposed to be a boring industry. So there is a lot going on out there. Yeah, I would say that, we always are alert to strategic assets and to which we apply our financial discipline. We got a great track record of buying great assets and integrating them. We're still coming off a fairly recent acquisition of two very good assets, Cholula and FONA that have performed very well for us, but that we still got paid for and so right now our primary focus is on deleveraging and building more dry powder. I won't -- I am not going to say never, but that's our primary focus right now. Okay. Well, I mean taking this as the primarily very U.S.-centric question. But we do expect that the shift in consumption to more cooking at-home and that consumer behavior to stick to an extent. We've never said that all of it's going to stay. But we do expect that a significant portion of that is going to stay and that this has been a step-up in our category. I mean consumers are still working from home and it looks like work from home is going to be a permanent part of the work environment. Our own proprietary research with consumers say that only a tiny fraction, I mean, less than 10% expect to cook less at-home than they do now, most expect to cook more. And so based on what we see happening in society, the -- what consumers are saying and but we are still experiencing from elevated demand and says that demand is going to continue to be strong. And I would just say also that we are in categories that we've chosen to be in that are strong to begin with and there's been strong underlying growth of all of the flavor categories that we're in over time. And the increment that has happened from the shift in consumption during the last two years really has accelerated growth by maybe a year or two of those categories. So it's not as extraordinary as everyone thinks, I just have that much to follow on. Great. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and reach of our balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. I am incredibly proud of McCormick's 2021 accomplishments. We drove strong performance while remaining focused on growth, committed to people and driven by purpose during another dynamic year. We're disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We are continuing to accelerate our momentum and drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well-positioned for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you for your time this morning."

            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide additional remarks on our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to build upon Lawrence's comments on Cholula and FONA, and highlight how we have delivered on our acquisition plans now as we have completed the first year. Starting on slide 19, as Lawrence already shared, we have created value by driving sales growth according to our plans. In addition, Cholula was margin accretive to the gross and operating margins in both of our segments, and FONA was accretive to the margins in the Flavor Solutions segment. We are delivering against our synergy and one-time cost estimates, in fact doing better than our acquisition plan. Starting with our original synergy targets, for Cholula, we have achieved the target of $10 million to be fully realized by 2022. For FONA, we are on track to achieve our targeted $7 million by the end of 2023. We are also achieving revenue synergies as expected. Our transaction and integration costs for Cholula and FONA are both lower than our acquisition plans. Early in 2021, we took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following the acquisitions, raising $1 billion through the issuance of five-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes, and therefore, realized lower interest expense than we originally projected. Additionally, our ongoing amortization expense is favorable to both of the acquisition models. In summary, we executed our year one acquisition plans in line with and in some areas better than our modeled, including the adjusted earnings per share accretion we expected. Successful acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy. Importantly, we have a proven track record of driving value through acquisitions and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, and Cholula and FONA are adding to that history. Now for our fourth quarter and full year performance, starting on slide 20, our fourth quarter capped off a year of record sales growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew constant currency sales 10%, with higher volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributing to the increases in both segments. Our organic sales growth was 6%, driven by strong growth in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments, and incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency, with both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments growing double digits. During the fourth quarter, our Consumer segment sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix, pricing actions and a 2% increase from our Cholula acquisition. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales grew 14% in constant currency, led by the Americas. On slide 21, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 13% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher volume and product mix, as the sustained shift to at-home consumption continues to drive increased demand, as well as lapping last year's capacity constraints. Pricing actions and a 3% increase from the Cholula acquisition also contributed to sales growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales increased 19% in constant currency, driven by broad-based growth across branded products, as well as an increase from the Cholula acquisition. A decline in private label sales partially offset the branded growth. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 5% from a year ago, due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. On a two-year basis, sales increased 5% in constant currency, driven by growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauce and mustard. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 11% in constant currency, due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China or away-from-home products and higher sales of cooking at-home products across the region. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales were flat, with growth across the region offset by a sales decline in India, due to the exit of some lower margin business. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on slide 24, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 12%, including a 7% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13% year-over-year, with FONA and Cholula contributing 11%. Organic sales growth was driven by the recovery of demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings and pricing. On a two-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019, driven by higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business in other parts of the portfolio. In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 16% compared to last year, due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers, as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, both driven by QSR growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customer's limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on slide 28, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges, increased 6% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment increased 14% or in constant currency 13%. Higher sales and CCI led cost savings more than offset cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges. Brand marketing investments as planned were 10% lower in the quarter, following an 18% Consumer segment increase in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, we increased our brand marketing investments 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 16% or 15% in constant currency. Higher sales and CCI led cost savings were more than offset by the cost pressures in this segment, unfavorable product mix and costs related to supply chain investments. Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERP program was offset by lower COVID-19 costs compared to last year. As seen on slide 29, adjusted gross profit margin declined 150 basis points, driven primarily by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the phase-in of our pricing actions. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 70 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth and the reduction in brand marketing, I just mentioned. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 80 basis points as we had expected. For the fiscal year, adjusted gross profit margin declined 140 basis points, primarily driven by the cost pressures we experienced in the second half of the year and the lag in pricing. Adjusted operating income grew 6% in constant currency, with the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income increasing 1% and the Flavor Solutions segment, 23%. Both segments were driven by higher sales and CCI led cost savings, partially offset by cost pressures and incremental strategic investment spending. Adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points for the fiscal year, driven by the adjusted gross profit margin decline. Turning to income taxes, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3%, compared to 22.9% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.1%, comparable to 19.9% in 2020. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5% for the full year. The elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest impacted both comparisons unfavorably. Our adjusted income from operations was also unfavorably impacted by the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern continents, following the sale of our minority stake earlier this year. For the fiscal year, this was partially offset by strong performance from our McCormick to Mexico joint venture. At the bottomline, as shown on slide 32, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.84 from $0.79 in the year ago period. And for the year, adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $3.05 for fiscal year 2021. The increases for both comparisons were driven by higher adjusted operating income attributable to strong sales growth. On slide 33, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $828 million. The decrease from last year was primarily due to the higher use of cash associated with working capital, and the payment of transaction and integration costs. The working capital comparison includes the impact of higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues, as well as buffer against cost volatility. We've returned $363 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $278 million for capital expenditures in 2021. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. For example, our new U.K. Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility, our ERP business transformation, additional hot sauce capacity in the U.S. and our new U.S. Northeast Distribution Center. In 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2021, as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives, and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 34, we are well-positioned for another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. We are projecting strong topline and operating performance, with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the topline, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. As Lawrence mentioned, we are taking further pricing actions in 2022, and as a result, expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth. We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by our pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. Our 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19 related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid-teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. Our cost savings target reflects the challenges of realizing commodity and packaging cost savings in the current inflationary environment. Importantly, we believe there continues to be a long runway to achieve cost savings in 2022 and beyond. Based on the expected timing of certain items, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our additional 2022 pricing actions are expected to be phased in during the second quarter. Cost inflation will have a more significant impact in the first half of 2022, as cost pressures accelerated in the back half of last year. We also expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021. As a reminder, we are also lapping a very strong business performance in the first quarter of 2021. Our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating profit growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind, I just mentioned. This results in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22, compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. In summary, we are well-positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies to drive another year of strong growth and performance. Yeah. Just to highlight a little bit to getting into that on sales in the first quarter, we're really comparing against a really strong first quarter of last year, where consumer was up really dramatically. So there's going to be a bit of a segment mix challenge in the first quarter. Talking about the first half also cost -- as pricing will grow during the year, costs though, which we talked about in mid-teens increase will be in effect in the first quarter. There will be a tough comparison there too, because the pricing won't offset that. If you remember back to last year, we had low single-digit inflation earlier in last year that rose to the high single-digit at the end of the year, now at mid single-teens that's a tough comp for the first quarter primarily and a bit of the first half. The other thing we have also is the ERP spend we talked about and we can talk about that later a little bit. But the timing of that -- last year we had some minimal spending in Q1 also. So a bunch of drivers that we think the profit will be back loaded in the year would be a bit of a tough comp in Q1. No. I think you covered it well. With the... Yeah. I will step on there, too. With the high topline growth and the flattish SG&A, that even with the gross margin flat to slightly down in that range. It's kind of -- you're going to get operating leverage that's going to drop through. Rob, I will take the first part of that, and Lawrence, take the second. First, great question, COVID cost and ERP are big drivers on our P&L. COVID costs, we did talk about how two years ago, we spent $50 million, last year $60 million. If you remember, we highlighted a large chunk of that was co-packing cost. So as we come out, our supply chain has improved over last year in the fourth quarter. We've eliminated most of those costs. But we still have underlying costs that, frankly, we're not treating as COVID cost anymore. We're treating as an ongoing business cost of labor, premium pay, things like that. They are going to continue into the future. So, that -- I am not going to give you an exact number. It's not $60 million. The significant part of that is going away in \u201822. Relating to ERP, if you remember from our third quarter call last year, we were talking about it at the time, a decrease in COVID costs in -- we expected a decrease in COVID costs in 2022 offset by an increase in the ERP costs. That being said, what we're saying now is and our -- we're still spending significant amounts on ERP in 2022. We spent -- we had talked last year about spending in 2021 around $50 million. 2021 came in a little heavier than that and in 2022, we're going to -- it's not a significant headwind, but it's still a significant investment. I'd say it's up slightly. It wasn't big enough to mention in our guidance. Now what has changed since three months ago? One, elevated and strong demand. We're really happy with that demand. As we went through our planning process, which we always do in the fall, the combination of that elevated demand, and as you know, our fourth quarter is really important to us and we have planned on significant go-lives in 2022. One, to protect our customer service and to make sure we are prudent. The go-lives would have slid into the fourth quarter because you have to build inventories and things like that to get ready for these major go-lives. We made the decision to slide those major go-lives out into 2023. The end result of all those moves is roughly between 2021, 2022 and 2023, it's about the same level of spend. So it's very smooth. It kind of eliminates that noise between years, which help you look at our underlying growth of operating profit over that time. But we're still really excited about the ERP investment, but we just made the decision, as I just talked about. Good morning. Hey, Adam. This is Mike. I will take that. Yeah. In fourth quarter, Flavor Solutions did have a bit of margin pressure. I mean, similar to consumer, obviously, the cost last year came ahead of our pricing actions. So that did -- obviously that impacted Flavor Solutions. But as we catch up into the first quarter and second quarter, that should be solved. But they did increase very quickly for us. I mean there's pass-throughs contractual agreements, so there's timing elements to a lot of our Flavor Solutions business. That thing being said, one of the -- you've seen also the great volume growth and sales growth we've had in Flavor Solutions over the past couple of years, and we're making strategic investments such as the U.K. flavor manufacturing plant. Those investments have costs associated with them. So in the fourth quarter, as we're starting to bring that plant live into next year and you should expect in early 2022, also a bit of a drag early in the year of Flavor Solutions you will see a bit of that due to the strategic investments of which the U.K. flavor manufacturing plant is just one. And we did have a little bit of unfavorable mix in the quarter, even though we were pruning -- continue to prune some of our lower margin business, there was a bit of a hard comparison versus 4Q of last year. And I will remind everybody, our Flavor Solutions tend to be a bit lumpy as well, driven by the activities of some of our large customers. Hi, Chris. It's Mike. I will answer that. I mean, last year we started out the year, as you remember, low-single digits and we transitioned into mid-single digits around -- I think around the third quarter call. In the fourth quarter call, we talked about the fourth quarter costs were up high-single digits, which made the whole year high end of the mid single-digit range... ...at least, I am saying it, so just to remind you where we were. This year is the mid-teens really driven by large commodity packaging and freight increases that we've all seen. From a Flavor Solutions versus Consumer, they're both impacted by all this. I mean, ocean freight, which is a big item for us because as you think about our peers, we get a lot of our products from Asia, other parts of the world where shipping containers and things like that. That ocean cost has gone up a lot. That impacts both the Consumer and the Flavor Solutions very equitably. Other items like pepper, garlic, things like that, we use on both sides. So I'd say, it's roughly the same overall materially. So we continue to work with our vendors. We struggle with the same challenges that all of our peers have with supplying bottles and things like that and there will be sporadic challenges along the way, but not broad based. Well, first, outbound freight is considered cost of goods sold for us. So we're similar to our peers. I mean, if you look at our gross margin, we're guiding comparable to down 50 basis points. The whole impact of pricing mid single-teens inflation is a big drag on that. So we're thinking of a 250 basis point dilution just because of pricing to cover costs. From a timing -- but that's offset, the good positives are CCI savings continuing to prove lower margin business and the COVID costs we've talked about previously. Next year has a little bit of a segment mix headwind as you know. And -- but I'd say from a timing perspective, as we talked about, the timing of our pricing coming in the second pricing come impact in the second quarter. It will build during the year cost, which will be with us the full year, so the first quarter will be heavily impacted as we talked about and the first half, a bit of that too, so it's a bit of a first half, second half play as we've talked about from a gross margin perspective. Yeah. I think that's fair, Rob. I think, this year, with the significant build in inventories to protect our customers and sales, some of the transaction costs we talked about earlier in the year from M&A has a little drag on that. But as we see into the future, some of those things get solved, so back to previous year levels, it makes sense. Thanks."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter performance demonstrates again that the combination of our balanced portfolio with the effective of execution of our strategies to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends and strong engagement with our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth. Remarkably, we delivered an eight percent sales increase versus last year and seventeen percent versus twenty nineteen. 01:40 Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we delivered organic sales growth on top of our exceptional third quarter performance last year. Our third quarter results also include strong contributions from Cholula and FONA. 01:55 Sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment was broad based with the at-home products in our portfolio, flavors and seasoning, growing at approximately the same rate as our away-from-home product, which was primarily driven by a robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurants and other food service customers attributable to COVID-nineteen restrictions and consumers reluctance to dine out. 02:18 Our consumer segment results reflect the lapping of the year ago elevated demand in the lockdown days of the pandemic from consumers eating and cooking more at home, as well as a sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre pandemic levels. Taken together, these results continued to demonstrate strength and diversity of our offering, the breadth and reach of our portfolio of compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels creates a balanced and diversified portfolio that enables us to drive consistency in our performance even at a volatile environment. 02:54 Turning to slide five, total third quarter sales grew eight percent from the year ago period or five percent in constant currency. Substantial constant currency sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment more than offset slight constant currency sales decline in our consumer segment, driven by the factors I just mentioned. 03:13 Adjusted operating income was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a three percent favorable impact from currency. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher cost inflation and industry wide logistics challenges as well as by a shift in sales between segments. On the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was zero point eight zero dollars compared to zero point seven six dollars in the year ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures. 03:43 As we\u2019ve stated previously, we expect growth to vary by quarter in twenty twenty one. Importantly, we have delivered outstanding year-to-date performance. Sales and adjusted operating income are up thirteen percent and nine percent year-over-year, respectively. Both of which include a three percent favorable impact from currency as we\u2019ve grown adjusted earnings per share of eight percent. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we've driven sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly twenty percent across all three metrics. 04:16 I'd like to say a few words about the current cost environments impact on our third quarter results, as well as our outlook, which Mike will cover in more detail. We stated in our July earnings call, we are operating in a dynamic cost environment and like the rest of the industry experiencing cost pressure. We're seeing broad based inflation across our raw and packaging materials, as well as transportation costs. To partially offset rising costs, we have raised prices where appropriate, but as usual, there is a timeline lag associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, the phase-in of most of our actions is taking place during the fourth quarter, those pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. 05:02 In the last few months, inflation has continued to ratchet it up, mainly with packaging and transportation costs. We\u2019re experiencing the highest inflationary period of the last decade or even two, We, along with our peers and customers are also facing additional pressure on our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity and labor shortages and distribution. These pressure does not only impact costs, but also negatively impact sales as the addition of further supply chain complexity makes it harder to get order shipped and received by customers. And this pressure is exemplified by continued elevated demand. 05:40 Overall, we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings and we expect to manage through this period as we have in the past. 05:52 Now let's turn to our third quarter segment business performance which includes comparisons to twenty nineteen pre pandemic levels as we believe these will be more meaningful than the comparisons to twenty twenty, given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year ago period. 06:11 Starting on slide seven. Consumer segment sales grew one percent, including a two percent favorable impact from currency and incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition compared to the highly elevated demand levels of the year ago period. Our consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpaces pre pandemic levels. 06:40 Our Americas constant currency sales declined one percent in the first quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing three percent growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined ten percent, following a thirty one percent consumption increase in the third quarter of twenty twenty, which results in an nineteen percent increase on a two year basis. 07:08 Demand has remained high as we are realizing to benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving and we're seeing sequential improvement in our share performance. That said, as I mentioned a moments ago, the current issues related to logistics pressures continue to make it challenging for market leaders like McCormick to keep high demand products in stock which has prevented us from making further progress in replenishing both retailer and consumer inventories in the third quarter. Importantly, though, we're better positioned than we were last year entering the holiday season and are confident in our holiday merchandising plans. 07:53 Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our nineteen percent consumption growth versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen was led by double digit growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauces, both Cholula and Frank's RedHot and barbecue sauce, as well as our Asian and frozen products. 08:11 In pure-play e-commerce, we delivered triple digit growth compared to twenty nineteen, with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the sixth consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the same period two years ago, which reflects the continuation of consumer cooking and using flavor more at-home and the strength of our brand. 08:47 Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the same period two years ago, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but our smaller brands as well. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus twenty nineteen. And when our consumers shop they were buying more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. 09:07 McCormick continues to win in Hot Sauce. Across our brands, McCormick grows to be the number one Hot Sauce manufacturer globally earlier this year. In the third quarter Frank's RedHot, the number one brand in the U.S. was joined at the top of the category by Cholula, which we have driven to the number two ranking. 09:26 Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the third quarter versus last year. Maintaining or gaining share across the region in key categories following our strong gains in the third quarter last year. 09:41 Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen our total EMEA region -- we drove double digit consumption growth in herbs, spices and seasoning. And turning up the heat, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption seventy five percent and has gained a significant share versus the two year ago period. across the region, our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two year ago period. 10:06 Our year to date higher brand marketing investments in the EMEA are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed, as well as our achieving above best market rates for rich engagement and click through for instance in our digital marketing. 10:21 In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter sales were strong reflecting our continued recovery from China's lower branded food service sales last year. Our consumer product demand in the region declined due to lapping significant growth last year. The region has also experienced supply chain challenges with ocean freight capacity constraints impacting the quarter's growth. 10:41 At Australia, we continue to see strong consumption growth versus twenty nineteen with key brands recently trending back towards twenty twenty levels with Frank's RedHot already higher than last year's elevated consumption. 10:55 Across all regions in our consumer segment, we are continuing to fuel our growth with our strong brand marketing, new product launches and our category management initiatives. We're making brand marketing investments across our portfolios to connect with our consumers, particularly online. 11:12 Early in the third quarter in the Americas, we began our search for the first director of Taco Relations. This was a dream opportunity for over five thousand applicants to showcase there Taco expertise and enthusiasm for our product and their video application. To date, we have garnered over one billion dollars earned impressions related to our search, and these will continue to grow upon the announcement of our new Director of Taco Relations next week on October fourth in celebration of National Taco Day. 11:42 We are not only creating buzz through our digital marketing, but also with our e-commerce direct to consumer new product launches. In the Americas, we drove new passionate users to our brands and digital properties with the launch of sunshine all-purpose seasoning, a new product development in partnership with social media influencer . Inspired by  personality and health and wellness focused recipes with salt free and gluten free Caribbean inspired blend sold out in just thirty nine minutes, generated record sales from e commerce driven innovation and over seven hundred million earned impressions. 12:19 Our new product launches differentiate our brands and strengthen our relevance with consumers. And with our global leadership position in hot sauce, we are in a perfect position to capitalize on consumers rising demand for hot and spicy flavors through a global heat platform. Our recent launch is the Frank's RedHot frozen appetizers and Cholula wing sauces in the Americas, as well as Frank's RedHot flavors in the EMEA have made strong contributions to growth in the third quarter. 12:48 Just in time for Halloween, EMEA is introducing dead hot gift sets for e-commerce, featuring Frank's RedHot. And in China, our recently launched ready to eat chili paste has the highest thirty day repeat rate of all McCormick directed to our products on T-Mall. 13:05 Turning to category management, our initiatives are designed to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both McCormick and retailers. These initiatives include simply changing shelf placement, for instance, increasing Cholula\u2019s velocity over thirty percent by changing the tile placement at a large retailer to reinvesting in the spice and seasoning shopping experience. In the U.S. we're anticipating a cumulative implementation of our spice sell program, since it began in twenty twenty of ten thousand stores by year-end versus twenty nineteen to remove year over year noise, sales in the beginning of August show retailers that have adopted despite all changes are growing the category faster than those who have not. And McCormick\u2019s branded spice and seasoning portfolio is growing solid mid-single digits faster in implemented stores versus stores which have not adopted the changes. 14:01 And in Eastern Europe, the rollout of our first choice bottle, which is perceived as premium and what was predominantly a sachet only market. It\u2019s elevating the spices and seasoning category and driving increased share at our Eastern European market. 14:16 Moving forward, we are confident that we will continue the momentum of our consumer segment. We have more consumers than pre pandemic, they have coming to our brand are having a good experience and are buying our products again. We're excited about our growth trajectory and expect long lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. 14:42 Turning to slide nine, our Flavor Solutions segment grew twenty one percent or seventeen percent in constant currency reflecting both strong base business growth and contributions from our FONA and Cholula acquisition. Our third quarter results include the robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other food service customers, many of which are lapping the curtailment -- away from home dining. As well as strong continued momentum on our packaged food and beverage customers. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and the away from home products in our portfolio. On a two year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions. 15:24 In the Americas, FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant third quarter growth and we're executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value added and technically insulated products. We continue to see outstanding growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers through new products and base business constrain. 15:46 Consumers rising global demand for hot and spicy flavors is driving growth for both our customer snacks and for our seasons that flavor them. Compared to last year's third quarter snack seasonings grew high single digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. 16:07 Our confidence that FONA will accelerate our global flavors platform continues to be reinforced by their excellent performance with double digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages are driving significant growth with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category. And finally, in the Americas, branded food service contributed significant growth for the quarter as our demand for this channel has continued to strengthen as more dining options reopen. 16:36 In EMEA, we had strong growth versus both last year and twenty nineteen across all markets and channels. Quick service restaurants or QSRs are driving growth through increased promotional activities as limited time offers. Our branded foodservice sales with easing restrictions in the hospitality industry increased at a double digit rate versus the third quarter of last year. And with packaged food and beverage companies, our performance was strong on top of last year's strong growth, but the hot and spicy trend fueling growth in snacks seasonings, particularly through new product innovation. 17:12 Our sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was partially impacted by the timing of our QSR customers strong limited time offers and their promotional activities in the third quarter of last year, which increased restaurant traffic as COVID-nineteen restriction is lifted. As we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter to quarter. 17:36 We recognized a part our third quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to low away from home demand last year. Notably, our growth also includes strong contributions from FONA and Cholula, robust growth with packaged food and beverage customer, both in the base business and in new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with QSRs. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we delivered thirteen percent constant currency growth, including FONA and Cholula and six percent constant currency organic growth. These results, combined with our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence and a continuation of our robust growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment. 18:22 Now on slide ten, I'm excited to share some important purpose led performance news. Just a few days ago, we remain as a global compact lead company by the United Nations for our ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its ten principles for responsible business, We are honored by this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and to be one of only thirty seven companies in the world, and the only U.S. based food producer to be included on this prestigious list. 18:52 Sustainable sourcing is a top priority and we've been actively working on initiatives such as our sustainability linked financing partnership with IFC and Citi which provides our urban spice suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability. As well as our partnership with Heifer International on the launch of the  (ph) Forestry project, which aims to increase small older pharma resilience and improve the quality of cardamom and all spice in Guatemala. 19:25 In addition, LATINA Style  is one of the top fifty best companies for LATINA store in the U.S. We are thrilled to be recognized for our continued efforts around diversity and inclusion. We're committed to the long term vitality of the people, communities and the planet we share and are proud of our impacts in these areas. We look forward to sharing more about these accomplishments as well as many others with you through our purpose led performance report, which will be issued early next year. 19:56 Before turning over to Mike, I'd like to make some qualitative comments regarding twenty twenty two. To be clear, we are not providing twenty twenty two guidance at the time. We are a growth company that we expect to grow in both of our segments next year. At the foundation of our sales growth, due to the rising consumer demand for flavor fueled by younger generations. We've intentionally focused on great categories that are growing and generating a long term tailwind. We're capitalizing on the long term consumer trends that\u2019s accelerated during the pandemic and we're successfully executing on our strategy and initiatives. 20:34 In this dynamic and fast phased environment we are ensuring that we remain focused on long term sustainable growth. Recently, cost pressures have rapidly accelerated and we're preparing for them to remain in twenty twenty two. We plan to mitigate these costs which we expect to fully offset over time through a combination of CPI led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and pricing actions as needed. 20:59 In addition, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. We also expect the impact of COVID-nineteen to persist into twenty twenty two, which will create continued broad based supply chain challenges. We've successfully demonstrated in the past our ability to manage through inflationary environments and cost pressures. 21:20 Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence that our long term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top-line growth and margin expansion. We have a strong foundation and remain focused on the long term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. 21:39 Around the world, McCormick employees drive for momentum and success, and I thank them for their hard work, engagement and dedication, particularly in such a volatile environment. 21:49 And now, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: 21:52 Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to twenty nineteen. 22:00 Starting on slide thirteen. Our top line growth continues to be strong. We grew constant currency sales five percent during the third quarter compared to last year with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing four percent across both segments. Our volume and mix drove our organic sales increase with Flavor Solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment. 22:22 Versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen, we grew sales fifteen percent in constant currency with both segments growing double digits. During the third quarter, our consumer segment continued to lap last year's exceptionally high demand. Versus twenty twenty, our third quarter consumer segment sales declined one percent in constant currency, which includes a three percent increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen, consumer segment sales grew fourteen percent in constant currency. 22:53 On slide fourteen, consumer segment sales in the Americas declined one percent in constant currency, lapping the elevated lockdown demand in the year ago period. As well as the logistics challenges Lawrence mentioned earlier. Incremental sales from the Cholula acquisition contributed three percent growth. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen sales increased seventeen percent in constant currency, led by significant growth in the McCormick, Lawry\u2019s, Grill Mates, OLD BAY, Frank's RedHot, Cholula, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden, Simply Asia, Stubb\u2019s and all  branded products. That's a lot of brands. Partially offset by a decline in private label. 23:33 In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined eleven percent from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes strong growth in our Eastern European market. On top of their significant volume growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the regions other markets. On a two year basis, sales increased ten percent in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our Kamis, Schwartz and Frank\u2019s RedHot branded products. 24:02 Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased eleven percent in constant currency due to the recovery of branded food service sales with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales increased four percent compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen including a sales decline in India resulting from a slower COVID-nineteen recovery. 24:26 Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and slide seventeen, we grew third quarter constant currency sales to seventeen percent, including an eight percent increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year over year increase led by the Americas and EMEA regions was due to strong growth, with both packaged food and beverage customers and in away from home products. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen Flavor Solutions segment sales grew sixteen percent in constant currency. 24:56 In the Americas Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew nineteen percent year over year with FONA and Cholula contributing twelve percent. Volume and product mix increased, driven by significantly higher sales through branded food service customers together with growth to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasoning. 25:16 On a two year basis, sales increased fifteen percent in constant currency versus twenty nineteen with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business. 25:30 In EMEA, constant currency sales grew nineteen percent compared to last year, due to increased sales to QSRs and branded food service customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased twenty three percent versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. 25:55 In the Asia Pacific Region, Flavor Solutions sales rose one percent in constant currency versus last year, and increased eight percent in constant currency versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Both driven by QSR growth and partially impact by the timing of our customers limited time offers and promotional activities. 26:15 As seen on slide twenty one, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a three percent favorable impact from currency. 26:32 Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined ten percent to one hundred and eighty million dollars, growing constant currency twelve percent, driven by the cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges, partially offset by CCI led cost savings. 26:48 These logistics challenges not only impacted costs, but also negatively impacted sales. In the flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose thirty two percent to eighty four million dollars or twenty seven percent in constant currency. Higher sales, CPI led cost savings and favorable product mix as we continue to migrate our portfolio more than offset the cost pressures in this segment. 27:14 Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERO program was offset by lower COVID-nineteen costs compared to last year. During the quarter, we invested in brand marketing ahead of last year and notably, we have increased our investments eleven percent on a year to date basis. 27:33 As seen on slide twenty two, adjusted gross profit margin declined two sixty basis points driven primarily by the cost pressures we are experiencing and the lag in pricing. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined one hundred and ten basis points driven by leverage from sales growth. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of one hundred and fifty basis points. In addition to the factors I mentioned a few moments ago, a sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both gross and operating margins. 28:08 Turning to income taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was fourteen point one percent compared to nineteen point three percent in the year ago period. Both period were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with the larger impact this year due to the favorable impact of a reversal of a tax accrual. 28:29 Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined five percent versus the third quarter of twenty twenty. Based on our year to date results, we now expect a mid-single digit increase in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations for twenty twenty one, up from our previous projection of a low single digit decrease. This improvement is driven by strong performance from our McCormick Mexico joint venture. 28:55 At the bottom line, as shown on slide twenty five, third quarter twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share was zero point eight zero dollars compared to zero point seven six dollars for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by a lower adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen, our ten percent increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by sales growth. 29:20 On slide twenty six, we\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the third quarter of twenty twenty one, our cash flow from operations was three seventy three million dollars, which is lower than the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction and integration costs and higher use of cash associated with working capital. This includes the impact of planned higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues, as well as buffer against cost volatility. 29:57 Through the third quarter, we've returned two seventy two million dollars of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used one hundred and ninety million dollars for capital expenditures. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 30:21 Now turning to our twenty twenty one financial outlook on slides twenty seven and twenty eight. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and underlying performance, tempered by the higher inflation ahead of pricing, and the logistic challenges we previously mentioned. 30:45 For twenty twenty one, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-nineteen costs and ERP investment, as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We continue to expect an estimated three percentage point favorable impact from currency rates on sales. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a two percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. 31:18 At the top line, due to our strong year to date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales nine percent to ten percent, which is the high end of our previous projection of eight percent to ten percent and includes a four percent incremental impact from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 31:39 We had initially projected an incremental acquisition impact in the range of three point five percent to four percent. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing and new products, as well as pricing. 31:58 We are now projecting our twenty twenty one adjusted gross profit margin to be one hundred and fifty points to one hundred and seventy basis points lower than twenty twenty due to the increasing cost pressures I mentioned earlier. While we continue to expect a mid-single digit increase in inflation for the year, it has moved higher and is now approaching a double digit increase in the fourth quarter. 32:20 Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, cost inflation and COVID-nineteen costs, partially offset by pricing and margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 32:36 As a reminder, we priced to offset cost increases, we do not margin out. Our estimate for COVID-nineteen cost remains unchanged at sixty million dollars in twenty twenty one versus fifty million dollars in twenty twenty and is weighted to the first half of the year. 32:54 Reflecting the change in gross profit margin outlook, we are lowering our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be eight percent to ten percent constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges, and partially offset by a one percent reduction from increased COVID-nineteen costs compared to twenty twenty and a three percent reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. 33:29 This result in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of four percent to six percent in constant currency. This projection includes the mid-single digit inflationary pressure as well as our  cost savings target of approximately one hundred and ten million dollars. It also includes an expected low single digit increase in brand marketing investments. 33:51 Considering the year to date impact from discrete items, we now project our twenty twenty one adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately twenty one percent as compared to our previous projection of twenty three percent. This outlook versus our twenty twenty adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately one percent. 34:15 We are lowering our twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share expectations to five percent to seven percent growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income tax rate, as well as the higher adjusted income from unconsolidated operations. 34:35 Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in twenty twenty one is now two point nine seven dollars to three point zero two dollars. This compares to two point eight three dollars of adjusted earnings per share in twenty twenty and represents eight percent to ten percent growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to COVID-nineteen costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. 35:02 I'll now turn it back to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: 35:05 Now I'd like to share our financial results and outlook in more detail. I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide twenty nine. Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we grow strong sales growth despite a challenging year over year comparison. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we have driven significant double digit growth rates for sales, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. 35:31 We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and are continuing the momentum we are gaining in away from home consumption. We're confident that our growth momentum of our business is sustainable. As a reminder, McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of short term pressures. 35:57 Our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence and our long term growth algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top-line growth and margin expansion. We are driving McCormick forward and building value for our shareholders. 36:10 Now let's turn to you questions.\nOperator: 36:14 Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: 36:50 Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: 36:52 Hi, Andrew.\nMike Smith: 36:53 Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: 36:53 Hi there. Maybe to start out at our recent conference and then, again, this morning, you\u2019ve alluded to cost and supply chain disruptions likely continuing into fiscal twenty twenty two, others have made very similar sort of comments. Of course, you\u2019ll have more pricing kicking in among other actions to mitigate some of the challenges. I think you also had mentioned that ERP costs could be offset by COVID expenses coming down. So, I guess things remain very fluid, of course, and you're not obviously giving specific twenty two guidance as of yet. But I'm trying to get a sense of whether on algorithm year, particularly on the profit side would be too much to ask in fiscal twenty twenty two at this stage. All things considered, particularly given what I assume will be continued margin pressure, at least through the first half next year?\nLawrence Kurzius: 37:40 Right. Well, first of all, Andrew, thanks for the opportunity to talk about it. It\u2019s kind of pretty high level question, right?  in your question, you are close to couple of my points that I would actually make to answer it. Beginning with -- just to be clear, I'm not going to give guidance for next year. 38:01 There are a lot of moving parts, things are fluid. We are right in the middle of putting together our budgets for next year right now. As we said in the call, our long -- we're very confident about our algorithm over the long term. I'm just not ready to talk about it in twenty twenty two, specifically just yet. But in our prepared remarks, I did say we expect growth in both segments. And so, I'll start there and then I'll bring it back to profit. 38:34 Our -- McCormick is unique and that we've been differentiated by strong growth as underlying trends that support our business includes demographic tailwind from younger consumers that has nothing to do with the pandemic and then many of the consumption trends we believe were reinforce and accelerated by the pandemic. So we believe that going into the pandemic, our growth was differentiated already through it, it's been differentiated and coming out, but it continues to be differentiated that we paid investments including during the time of this pandemic, both organic and through smart acquisitions that put our portfolio more and more into high growth categories like hot sauce and flavor. 39:21 And on top of this, we're trying to have the top line benefit of pricing in twenty twenty two. So we are confidence in strong growth going forward. For operating profit there are a lot of puts and takes. Over the last few years we've had rising ERP investments, over the last two we've had the shock of extraordinary COVID cost and right now, we as everyone else not just in our industry, but across business in general are wrestling with decades high inflation. And that's everywhere, we're not unique The first two of these rising European investments versus COVID costs should largely offset in twenty twenty two. And I think just given the magnitude of the cost that we've described previously, everyone should have an expectation around those largely offsetting. 40:16 And first, the cost pricing is going to kick it, pricing has lagged, we have our pricing in the U.S. largely going into effect in fourth quarter, in particular. And so, I would expect that we would see \u2013 you should expect to see the benefits from that, not just in the top line, but running it through the P&L. But remember, the math says that margins compression take pricing, our approach is to take pricing to pass through costs and so the both the numerator and denominator go up and so the fraction gets a little bit smaller. 40:58 So while we do expect that pricing to come in, it would be reasonable to expect some level of margin compression. Nonetheless, with the pricing action and other steps we will take to offset cost and the top line growth that we expect, I think it's very reasonable to expect solid operating profit growth next year. I'm not ready yet to say if it's exactly on algorithm.\nAndrew Lazar: 41:24 Right. I appreciate that color. That's helpful. And then one very quick follow-up and it may be tough to parse out. In the quarter though, are you able to sort of break out what impact some of the supply constraints may have had on overall sort of company organic growth? I think organic growth was up about one percent. I don\u2019t know if some of the supply constraints were significant enough that it would meaningfully change what organic growth look like in the quarter. Thank you so much.\nLawrence Kurzius: 41:50 It actually did have an impact on the fourth quarter. I think -- sorry, I said forth, I misspoke there, it\u2019s third quarter. And we haven't quantified that and I'm not prepared to, but it was material. We normally would not have a backlog at all to have -- the idea of having a backlog of orders is unprecedented, we have backlog that's measurable in days. And so it did have a \u2013 it definitely had an impact. It would have been our hope to actually continue to rebuild trade inventories as we went through the quarter which have not yet been fully recovered and we were not able to do so. We really wanted and planned to ship of more of these logistics challenges are very real -- we've got a very strategic discussion just now and a very tactical one. But just simply getting product out there has been a challenge in the face of the -- but it's still very high demand at the same time that we're having these logistical challenges. I\u2019d say that the trade channels are still a bit starved for inventory.\nMike Smith: 43:12 We\u2019ve noticed -- we didn't narrow our range on sales to the high end of the range. So we have very strong confidence in the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Lazar: 43:20 Got it. Thanks you so much.\nOperator: 43:23 Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: 43:30 Hi. Thank you. Just on pricing, are there any geographies or categories or brands where maybe getting the pricing you hoped for has been little more challenging than in others? And I guess I'm curious where are you in your, I guess, journey, so to speak of taking incremental pricing to offset some of the newer or more severe headwinds you're facing? I'm trying to figure out, if you're still having conversations with customers, do you feel most of the heavy lifting is done there for maybe some of the second rounds that'd be helpful. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: 44:04 Well, first of all, I won't say that there's particular problem, these actions always have some degree of commercial tension in them and so I don't want to get too specific there. As such, there are ongoing conversations with customers, I think that there are some new conversations that we had. All of our actions on pricing are on track. Particularly for the U.S. the price increases that we talked about earlier year in the year have been solved in. 44:41 There is a time lag though, especially with how quickly cost have gone up. The inflation is accelerated since we launched those pricing. So there's more work to do in that area in twenty twenty two. Phasing of most of our actions is happening in Q4 and we would expect to see the benefit of that in twenty twenty two.\nMike Smith: 45:11 And I think I'd point you back Ken to historical perspective here. We had high inflationary periods in the past in the two thousand and eight, two thousand and nine timeframe, two thousand eleven, two thousand and twelve we are being successfully put in pricing, it's actually both  U.S. consumer during one of those time periods and we're able to pass through the pricing. We also pulled a lot of other levers whether it's CCI, discretionary spending to get to Andrew's point about getting back on algorithm from a profit perspective.\nKen Goldman: 45:42 Great. Thank you. And I'll pass it on there.\nOperator: 45:48 Next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: 45:55 Thanks. I think this question will sound like Ken's question, maybe a different tack though. Is the conversation different with retailers on how to take pricing or how to think about pricing in the latest -- in relation to the latest acceleration, because I think some retailers out there consider the supply chain disruption to be temporary, the labor challenges will go away. And as a result, does that mean you have to shift more towards, I don't know more variable actions on promotions or packaging changes rather than a straight up list pricing increase.\nLawrence Kurzius: 46:40 Well again, I'm going to say that, I can't give specific about any one particular customer, certainly the pricing actions that we just took, we had a lot of company going out there. And so I think retailers -- what they heard from us was similar to what they heard from others. I'm not so sure, we have gotten that kind of feedback that retailers thinks that these increases our transitory. 47:09 There's been some discussion about inflation not continuing to escalate, but there hasn't been any discussion about this not being reset of pricing levels. And I think that there's broad recognition of that and I will say that I was on a call with  yesterday, where he was saying very much the same thing. And so I think that the outlook is that these costs are not transient, they are here to stay and they're potentially going to have to find their way through in the form of pricing that gets to the consumer. And bell tightening across the entire supply chain, including us as a supplier to our customer.\nRobert Moskow: 47:55 Okay, great. So you're saying is, it's similar types of conversations, there's no different types of push back on the second round compared to the first round, it's a similar conversation?\nLawrence Kurzius: 48:10 Yeah. I'm not \u2013 I\u2019m not differentiating between the two right now. I think if i got much further than that I'm getting into too specific that are good to  two perspective.\nRobert Moskow: 48:26 Okay. Anything else you want to tell us about what  Paul said? Or if you want to leave it there?\nLawrence Kurzius: 48:32 Just like us, he has got to do it in a public form, so it\u2019s all out there.\nRobert Moskow: 48:37 Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 48:41 Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: 48:47 Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: 48:49 Good morning.\nMike Smith: 48:50 Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: 48:51 So, I guess, on the inflation dynamics you've highlighted, specifically logistics and packaging. And I just want to be clear that is that more on the ocean freight side, is it domestic trucking, all of the above? And beyond those two discrete buckets, is there anything notable in terms of your own wage rates? And are you seeing pressures in your own labor force domestically given the rise and given the broad based labor pressures you're seeing?\nMike Smith: Hey, Adam, this is Mike. I'll take this first and Lawrence may add few comments. I mean, like we said on the call today, you're right, it's -- eighty percent to ninety percent of this is really logistics, transportation, packaging, things like that. So we have a really good line of sight to our commodity costs in the fourth quarter, obviously. 49:43 It's really both ocean freight, but also domestic freight. You've actually seen after Hurricane Ida, some of the domestic rates have gone up again. So that's part of the new news, and I think we're all experiencing in the U.S, in particular. You\u2019ve seen globally in the UK natural gas challenges and things like that too and trucking challenges. So, it's both getting it here and getting it to customers. If on a wage rate perspective, we've taken actions just like other companies have to aggressively attract talent in our manufacturing facilities and DCs with retention bonuses and other actions like that. So I think to Lawrence\u2019s point, these labor rates aren't going to go back down, there's been a reset of cost level that may not escalate further, that\u2019s to be seen, but it's not -- we're not going to have deflation on labor rates.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I'll just add to that, the cost increase that we're talking about are -- these are not things that are unique to McCormick at all. The biggest increases has been on packaged materials and on transportation costs followed by raw material and labor. And I'd say that we look lot like everybody else in that regard.\nAdam Samuelson: 51:04 Okay. That's helpful. And then if I can ask more longer term margin question, and it's really in the Flavor Solutions business. And I guess, I'm thinking to kind a couple of years pre-COVID in that business. And you done it through acquisition and internal initiatives and done a lot of heavy lifting to get the margins in that business to the kind of fourteen percent, fifteen percent level from about ten percent back in twenty fifteen, twenty sixteen. And we're now back in the thirteen percent to fourteen percent range. I'm just trying to think about where that business can go from here once we maybe get through some of these price cost and balances in the near term. Do you think there's a lot more room on mix to really push that business higher their investments in technology and R&D on the flavor side that you've got to accelerate to temper that. I'm just trying to think about that being a driver of earnings growth, maybe beyond some of the shorter term inflationary pressure that we're experiencing right now.\nLawrence Kurzius: 52:08 Adam, we're going to have to bring you in to help write some of our IR materials. The -- we are very confident in the margin trajectory of our Flavor Solutions business. We are really changing the portfolio, the big driver of our margin improvement over time has been the shift in the portfolio, there's more value added technically insulated products, we place investments in that part of the business, we've done acquisitions in that part of the business to accelerate the growth. And as the portfolio continues to shift in that direction, it's going to drive really a structural improvement in margin. Those are just categories that command a better margin and it's going to mix the business up. And at the same time, we've made decision to get out of some of the lower margin stuff, some of which is really low margin. And we've found graceful ways of exiting some of that without getting on the wrong side of customer relationships. 53:20 So, I'd say, our long term outlook for continued expansion of our flavor solution is one of the things that underpins our confidence are long term algorithm.\nMike Smith: 53:33 I think the FONA acquisition has even gave us more confidence and continuing to migrate that portfolio with really combining their technical expertise with ours.\nLawrence Kurzius: 53:43 And there's been a number of notes that we are going to try and parse it. Organic sales out from an acquisition and so on. We're are reporting one hundred percent of what we sell in FONA as acquisition related, but we have grown that business tremendously since we bought it. And we're very \u2013 and same with Cholula as well. But your question specifically is about flavor solutions and that's really part of that portfolio migration.\nAdam Samuelson: 54:15 Okay, That's helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: 54:20 Our next question coming from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: 54:25 Hi, good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: 54:27 Good morning.\nChris Growe: 54:28 Hi. I just had a question for you if I could in relation to pricing. Just understand, would you expect that your pricing would offset your inflation once all your pricing is in place?\nLawrence Kurzius: 54:41 I'm going to say that all of the levers that we're going to pull well. But part of what CCI does is offset inflation to an extent, part of it offsets cost increases and part of it we bring into reinvest in the business in otherwise, hence part of it makes its way to the bottom line and that\u2019s the intend. So we are expecting that over time we will recover all of the costs, all of the levers, it won't be one hundred percent in pricing.\nChris Growe: 55:12 Okay. Understand. Thank you. I understand. And the other question I was going to say was, just as you get into -- is it expected that you would have a lot of these levers pulled by say, first quarter of twenty two? I know you've got some pricing going into place in the fourth quarter. I'm not trying to get to an exact time or guidance for next year. Just understand the timeframe around pulling all these levers?\nLawrence Kurzius: 55:37 I think that -- I don't want to get too deep into to talking about twenty twenty two. I did want to give guidance for the year, and I don't want to give guidance for any the quarter.\nMike Smith:\nw:\nMike Smith: 56:04 And also you realize that there's a lot of focus on the U.S. timing, but this happens around the world at different time points based on local. So we'll have a lot more to say in the January call.\nChris Growe: 56:16 Understood. Okay. And I had just one question and it's just a more to understanding kind of this inventory situation we'll call it, I guess, in rebuilding. We can debate IRI or Nielsen data, but it shows like your U.S. sales down eleven percent and, again, we can debate that number. I see your Americas business again, not a perfect representation, totally the U.S. being down four. Is that gap -- this sort of inventory build you expected for this quarter year over year knowing that you were shipping below inventory -- below consumption a year ago? Or is there more inventory build to come, I guess, that\u2019s what I'm trying to get to?\nLawrence Kurzius: 56:49 If you do the math, Chris, looking back two years. So look at the underserved twenty nineteen. Last year, you're right, we weren't shipping the consumption, demand was extraordinarily elevated. And if you strip out the acquisition, you have demand, consumption is up nineteen percent, our shipments are up thirteen. So this rate map on that would suggest we under-shipped by about six percentage points, which is very substantial. We did that's same math in Q2 and we were ahead by four. So it looks like we -- some of the -- some of the inventory build that we did. But in twenty nineteen we have holiday terms program in place, which we normally would do. Normally in the third quarter we're starting to build trade inventories for the heavy fall season. 57:37 And so that would have been part of the underlying demand. So when you net that all out, we think we're pretty close to even on shipping versus the true change in consumption. But that includes not being able to build trade inventories for the holidays as we would have hoped. And so we do think that we're -- as I said -- one of the questions earlier that, the trade channel right now is bit starved for inventory in the U.S.. Now we think of that as really slashing between third and fourth quarter and it's still going to end up getting captured within the year. 58:30 So it doesn't much change our outlook for the full year, it makes us anticipate a pretty strong -- pretty strong fourth quarter. But to ramp back to where we are on rebuilding, we're not as far along as we would have hoped.\nChris Growe: 58:48 Okay. That was good color. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: 58:55 Our next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteve Powers: 59:01 Yes. Hey, thanks. And you might just -- I think you sort of addressed this in response to Chris\u2019s question, but just to play it back. So when we think about your intention to fully offset pressures over time and appreciating that there's a rolling process to this. I think -- I don't know, if Chris -- if you were speaking to Chris responses, id it on pricing or just all the offsets, but I guess, what I'm trying to get a sense for is just on those rolling offsets when do you think you hit run rate -- your run rate achievement of those offsets. Is that a middle of next year type of timeline? Or is it more realistic to think that it progresses all the way through and it's not until closer to the end of twenty two where you hit the full offset run rate. Just trying to get a sense order of magnitude of the pacing of your effort?\nMike Smith: 59:58 I mean, obviously, I mean a lot of depends on the future cost environment too in this. I mean, we put in pricing in the U.S. to just kind of going to partially hit in the fourth quarter like we said last quarter. The full impact is going to be in twenty twenty two. Now, if costs continue to accelerate, we'll have to address that with other actions. But I think it\u2019s speculative at this point to try to call twenty two. And the timing is by quarter and by halves,\nSteve Powers: 60:27 Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Can i ask just a cleanup up on tax and -- appreciating the three benefits you've now realized in twenty twenty one. And I'm not asking for twenty two, just on a normalized basis, has we think about your sort of the tax run rate for the business going forward. Any color on past taxes versus GAAP taxes that will great as well.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, it's a great question. And obviously, we talk about this actually at our 10-Q disclosure. Now we talk about kind of a underlying rate of twenty four percent to twenty five percent based on country mix, the underlying tax rates that we have and our expectations for the year. And generally what happens and what happened this quarter, there are discrete either programs or tax team runs, there are acquisitions in the past that we clean up some of the assumptions or estimates or there's statute to limitations that drop off where we\u2019ve tended to realize some discrete tax benefits. So it\u2019s exactly what happened this quarter, but under the current tax regime, with Guilty and Citi and all these things globally, it's twenty four percent to twenty five percent. Obviously, we're all waiting to see what happens in Washington to see what future rates are. And I\u2019d say our cash taxes are pretty close to that too.\nSteve Powers: 61:48 Thank you very much.\nOperator: 61:52 Our next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jeffrey. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: 61:58 Great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch on private label for second, given you still operate that side of business a bit as well as brands. Obviously, there's been kind of ongoing discussion kind of where state of that overall industry kind of sits as we kind of get through the pandemic. So I\u2019m just curious, given some of the comments around, let's say, trade inventory not exactly where you want it to be going  and did pricing forthcoming. I'm just kind of curious what you've seen or heard the retailers as of late around demand for kind of your private label products versus brands? And then just kind of how you think about price gaps as you kind of enter this pricing phase. That's first question. Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: 62:47 Sure. Well, generally across all categories, private label has loss share in the pandemic  as a group have gained and then recent results that we just announced, our brands were strong private labels . When it comes to pricing, that costs are going up for every raw materials, packaging, labor and transportation and that applies for private label as well and so pricing actions that we are going forward are including the private label products that we manufacture and I would expect that in many cases, just because the price at a lower price point that they may see a higher percentage inflation rate because of the same costs flow through, but it's going to be a bigger percentage.\nRob Dickerson: 63:43 Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, we've obviously heard from a lot for companies so far your elasticity measures look great relative to history, given some of this elevated demand. I'm just curious, again, I know you are not giving twenty guidance, but you have to have some thoughts as to kind of what you might be baking in on the elasticity side, kind of what I\u2019m hearing is, if there's growth expected in both segments next year and pricing coming. I'm kind of assuming that the answer here is that there could be some incremental distribution gains to offset some of your elasticity, demand remains elevated, just kind of any comments around that kind of volume side versus the price side and where you thinking your elasticity you can shake out? Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: 64:32 Sure. The demand remains elevated, our categories for -- we're already growing before the pandemic and we need to growth through it and there's \u2013 we have talked endlessly about the underlying demand for flavor growing, the younger consumers are fueling that. And as we've gone through the pandemic, we've gained household penetration, usage rates are up and we haven't talked about it much, but we -- I think we had a comment about it in the prepared remarks that purchases per purchase occasion are up a lot. And so consumers are buying more of our products and we expect that to continue to be the case. So I'd say our outlook continue to be positive for strong sales growth. 65:27 And if you look at consensus sales for next year that are out there, they're pretty anemic and I guess we're trying to definitely suggest that there's a reason to reconsider that.\nRob Dickerson: 65:41 All right. Thank you. It\u2019s very helpful, Lawrence. Appreciate it.\nOperator: 65:46 Thank you. Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: 65:53 Hey. Just very quickly, Lawrence, I think you quantified on a two year basis Americas shipments up thirteen percent, consumption up nineteen percent and doesn't that also include your private label business being down in that two year period. So therefore the gap isn't really six hundred basis points. It might be a little bit less.\nLawrence Kurzius: 66:19 It's a very call number overall compared to our branded portfolio change, it\u2019s definitely less than one percent differential.\nRobert Moskow: 66:27 Less than one percent. Okay. Thanks for the math.\nOperator: 66:33 Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: 66:42 Oh my gosh, we are out of questions. Great. Thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and the reach of a balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. Very are very pleased with our outstanding year to date operating performance, which proves the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities as a company. Looking ahead, we expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on our strategy, actively respond to change consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities. Thank you for your time this morning.\nOperator: 67:17 Thank you, Lawrence. And thanks everyone to joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please reach out to me. This concludes this morning's call. Have a good day everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "01:12 Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter performance demonstrates again that the combination of our balanced portfolio with the effective of execution of our strategies to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends and strong engagement with our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth. Remarkably, we delivered an eight percent sales increase versus last year and seventeen percent versus twenty nineteen. 01:40 Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we delivered organic sales growth on top of our exceptional third quarter performance last year. Our third quarter results also include strong contributions from Cholula and FONA. 01:55 Sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment was broad based with the at-home products in our portfolio, flavors and seasoning, growing at approximately the same rate as our away-from-home product, which was primarily driven by a robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurants and other food service customers attributable to COVID-nineteen restrictions and consumers reluctance to dine out. 02:18 Our consumer segment results reflect the lapping of the year ago elevated demand in the lockdown days of the pandemic from consumers eating and cooking more at home, as well as a sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre pandemic levels. Taken together, these results continued to demonstrate strength and diversity of our offering, the breadth and reach of our portfolio of compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels creates a balanced and diversified portfolio that enables us to drive consistency in our performance even at a volatile environment. 02:54 Turning to slide five, total third quarter sales grew eight percent from the year ago period or five percent in constant currency. Substantial constant currency sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment more than offset slight constant currency sales decline in our consumer segment, driven by the factors I just mentioned. 03:13 Adjusted operating income was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a three percent favorable impact from currency. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher cost inflation and industry wide logistics challenges as well as by a shift in sales between segments. On the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was zero point eight zero dollars compared to zero point seven six dollars in the year ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures. 03:43 As we've stated previously, we expect growth to vary by quarter in twenty twenty one. Importantly, we have delivered outstanding year-to-date performance. Sales and adjusted operating income are up thirteen percent and nine percent year-over-year, respectively. Both of which include a three percent favorable impact from currency as we've grown adjusted earnings per share of eight percent. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we've driven sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly twenty percent across all three metrics. 04:16 I'd like to say a few words about the current cost environments impact on our third quarter results, as well as our outlook, which Mike will cover in more detail. We stated in our July earnings call, we are operating in a dynamic cost environment and like the rest of the industry experiencing cost pressure. We're seeing broad based inflation across our raw and packaging materials, as well as transportation costs. To partially offset rising costs, we have raised prices where appropriate, but as usual, there is a timeline lag associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, the phase-in of most of our actions is taking place during the fourth quarter, those pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. 05:02 In the last few months, inflation has continued to ratchet it up, mainly with packaging and transportation costs. We're experiencing the highest inflationary period of the last decade or even two, We, along with our peers and customers are also facing additional pressure on our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity and labor shortages and distribution. These pressure does not only impact costs, but also negatively impact sales as the addition of further supply chain complexity makes it harder to get order shipped and received by customers. And this pressure is exemplified by continued elevated demand. 05:40 Overall, we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings and we expect to manage through this period as we have in the past. 05:52 Now let's turn to our third quarter segment business performance which includes comparisons to twenty nineteen pre pandemic levels as we believe these will be more meaningful than the comparisons to twenty twenty, given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year ago period. 06:11 Starting on slide seven. Consumer segment sales grew one percent, including a two percent favorable impact from currency and incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition compared to the highly elevated demand levels of the year ago period. Our consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpaces pre pandemic levels. 06:40 Our Americas constant currency sales declined one percent in the first quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing three percent growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined ten percent, following a thirty one percent consumption increase in the third quarter of twenty twenty, which results in an nineteen percent increase on a two year basis. 07:08 Demand has remained high as we are realizing to benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving and we're seeing sequential improvement in our share performance. That said, as I mentioned a moments ago, the current issues related to logistics pressures continue to make it challenging for market leaders like McCormick to keep high demand products in stock which has prevented us from making further progress in replenishing both retailer and consumer inventories in the third quarter. Importantly, though, we're better positioned than we were last year entering the holiday season and are confident in our holiday merchandising plans. 07:53 Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our nineteen percent consumption growth versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen was led by double digit growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauces, both Cholula and Frank's RedHot and barbecue sauce, as well as our Asian and frozen products. 08:11 In pure-play e-commerce, we delivered triple digit growth compared to twenty nineteen, with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the sixth consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the same period two years ago, which reflects the continuation of consumer cooking and using flavor more at-home and the strength of our brand. 08:47 Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the same period two years ago, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but our smaller brands as well. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus twenty nineteen. And when our consumers shop they were buying more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. 09:07 McCormick continues to win in Hot Sauce. Across our brands, McCormick grows to be the number one Hot Sauce manufacturer globally earlier this year. In the third quarter Frank's RedHot, the number one brand in the U.S. was joined at the top of the category by Cholula, which we have driven to the number two ranking. 09:26 Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the third quarter versus last year. Maintaining or gaining share across the region in key categories following our strong gains in the third quarter last year. 09:41 Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen our total EMEA region -- we drove double digit consumption growth in herbs, spices and seasoning. And turning up the heat, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption seventy five percent and has gained a significant share versus the two year ago period. across the region, our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two year ago period. 10:06 Our year to date higher brand marketing investments in the EMEA are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed, as well as our achieving above best market rates for rich engagement and click through for instance in our digital marketing. 10:21 In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter sales were strong reflecting our continued recovery from China's lower branded food service sales last year. Our consumer product demand in the region declined due to lapping significant growth last year. The region has also experienced supply chain challenges with ocean freight capacity constraints impacting the quarter's growth. 10:41 At Australia, we continue to see strong consumption growth versus twenty nineteen with key brands recently trending back towards twenty twenty levels with Frank's RedHot already higher than last year's elevated consumption. 10:55 Across all regions in our consumer segment, we are continuing to fuel our growth with our strong brand marketing, new product launches and our category management initiatives. We're making brand marketing investments across our portfolios to connect with our consumers, particularly online. 11:12 Early in the third quarter in the Americas, we began our search for the first director of Taco Relations. This was a dream opportunity for over five thousand applicants to showcase there Taco expertise and enthusiasm for our product and their video application. To date, we have garnered over one billion dollars earned impressions related to our search, and these will continue to grow upon the announcement of our new Director of Taco Relations next week on October fourth in celebration of National Taco Day. 11:42 We are not only creating buzz through our digital marketing, but also with our e-commerce direct to consumer new product launches. In the Americas, we drove new passionate users to our brands and digital properties with the launch of sunshine all-purpose seasoning, a new product development in partnership with social media influencer . Inspired by  personality and health and wellness focused recipes with salt free and gluten free Caribbean inspired blend sold out in just thirty nine minutes, generated record sales from e commerce driven innovation and over seven hundred million earned impressions. 12:19 Our new product launches differentiate our brands and strengthen our relevance with consumers. And with our global leadership position in hot sauce, we are in a perfect position to capitalize on consumers rising demand for hot and spicy flavors through a global heat platform. Our recent launch is the Frank's RedHot frozen appetizers and Cholula wing sauces in the Americas, as well as Frank's RedHot flavors in the EMEA have made strong contributions to growth in the third quarter. 12:48 Just in time for Halloween, EMEA is introducing dead hot gift sets for e-commerce, featuring Frank's RedHot. And in China, our recently launched ready to eat chili paste has the highest thirty day repeat rate of all McCormick directed to our products on T-Mall. 13:05 Turning to category management, our initiatives are designed to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both McCormick and retailers. These initiatives include simply changing shelf placement, for instance, increasing Cholula's velocity over thirty percent by changing the tile placement at a large retailer to reinvesting in the spice and seasoning shopping experience. In the U.S. we're anticipating a cumulative implementation of our spice sell program, since it began in twenty twenty of ten thousand stores by year-end versus twenty nineteen to remove year over year noise, sales in the beginning of August show retailers that have adopted despite all changes are growing the category faster than those who have not. And McCormick's branded spice and seasoning portfolio is growing solid mid-single digits faster in implemented stores versus stores which have not adopted the changes. 14:01 And in Eastern Europe, the rollout of our first choice bottle, which is perceived as premium and what was predominantly a sachet only market. It's elevating the spices and seasoning category and driving increased share at our Eastern European market. 14:16 Moving forward, we are confident that we will continue the momentum of our consumer segment. We have more consumers than pre pandemic, they have coming to our brand are having a good experience and are buying our products again. We're excited about our growth trajectory and expect long lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. 14:42 Turning to slide nine, our Flavor Solutions segment grew twenty one percent or seventeen percent in constant currency reflecting both strong base business growth and contributions from our FONA and Cholula acquisition. Our third quarter results include the robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other food service customers, many of which are lapping the curtailment -- away from home dining. As well as strong continued momentum on our packaged food and beverage customers. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and the away from home products in our portfolio. On a two year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions. 15:24 In the Americas, FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant third quarter growth and we're executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value added and technically insulated products. We continue to see outstanding growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers through new products and base business constrain. 15:46 Consumers rising global demand for hot and spicy flavors is driving growth for both our customer snacks and for our seasons that flavor them. Compared to last year's third quarter snack seasonings grew high single digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. 16:07 Our confidence that FONA will accelerate our global flavors platform continues to be reinforced by their excellent performance with double digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages are driving significant growth with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category. And finally, in the Americas, branded food service contributed significant growth for the quarter as our demand for this channel has continued to strengthen as more dining options reopen. 16:36 In EMEA, we had strong growth versus both last year and twenty nineteen across all markets and channels. Quick service restaurants or QSRs are driving growth through increased promotional activities as limited time offers. Our branded foodservice sales with easing restrictions in the hospitality industry increased at a double digit rate versus the third quarter of last year. And with packaged food and beverage companies, our performance was strong on top of last year's strong growth, but the hot and spicy trend fueling growth in snacks seasonings, particularly through new product innovation. 17:12 Our sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was partially impacted by the timing of our QSR customers strong limited time offers and their promotional activities in the third quarter of last year, which increased restaurant traffic as COVID-nineteen restriction is lifted. As we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter to quarter. 17:36 We recognized a part our third quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to low away from home demand last year. Notably, our growth also includes strong contributions from FONA and Cholula, robust growth with packaged food and beverage customer, both in the base business and in new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with QSRs. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we delivered thirteen percent constant currency growth, including FONA and Cholula and six percent constant currency organic growth. These results, combined with our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence and a continuation of our robust growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment. 18:22 Now on slide ten, I'm excited to share some important purpose led performance news. Just a few days ago, we remain as a global compact lead company by the United Nations for our ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its ten principles for responsible business, We are honored by this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and to be one of only thirty seven companies in the world, and the only U.S. based food producer to be included on this prestigious list. 18:52 Sustainable sourcing is a top priority and we've been actively working on initiatives such as our sustainability linked financing partnership with IFC and Citi which provides our urban spice suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability. As well as our partnership with Heifer International on the launch of the  (ph) Forestry project, which aims to increase small older pharma resilience and improve the quality of cardamom and all spice in Guatemala. 19:25 In addition, LATINA Style  is one of the top fifty best companies for LATINA store in the U.S. We are thrilled to be recognized for our continued efforts around diversity and inclusion. We're committed to the long term vitality of the people, communities and the planet we share and are proud of our impacts in these areas. We look forward to sharing more about these accomplishments as well as many others with you through our purpose led performance report, which will be issued early next year. 19:56 Before turning over to Mike, I'd like to make some qualitative comments regarding twenty twenty two. To be clear, we are not providing twenty twenty two guidance at the time. We are a growth company that we expect to grow in both of our segments next year. At the foundation of our sales growth, due to the rising consumer demand for flavor fueled by younger generations. We've intentionally focused on great categories that are growing and generating a long term tailwind. We're capitalizing on the long term consumer trends that's accelerated during the pandemic and we're successfully executing on our strategy and initiatives. 20:34 In this dynamic and fast phased environment we are ensuring that we remain focused on long term sustainable growth. Recently, cost pressures have rapidly accelerated and we're preparing for them to remain in twenty twenty two. We plan to mitigate these costs which we expect to fully offset over time through a combination of CPI led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and pricing actions as needed. 20:59 In addition, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. We also expect the impact of COVID-nineteen to persist into twenty twenty two, which will create continued broad based supply chain challenges. We've successfully demonstrated in the past our ability to manage through inflationary environments and cost pressures. 21:20 Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence that our long term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top-line growth and margin expansion. We have a strong foundation and remain focused on the long term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. 21:39 Around the world, McCormick employees drive for momentum and success, and I thank them for their hard work, engagement and dedication, particularly in such a volatile environment. 21:49 And now, I'll turn it over to Mike. 35:05 Now I'd like to share our financial results and outlook in more detail. I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide twenty nine. Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we grow strong sales growth despite a challenging year over year comparison. Year to date versus twenty nineteen, we have driven significant double digit growth rates for sales, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. 35:31 We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and are continuing the momentum we are gaining in away from home consumption. We're confident that our growth momentum of our business is sustainable. As a reminder, McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of short term pressures. 35:57 Our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence and our long term growth algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top-line growth and margin expansion. We are driving McCormick forward and building value for our shareholders. 36:10 Now let's turn to you questions. 36:52 Hi, Andrew. 37:40 Right. Well, first of all, Andrew, thanks for the opportunity to talk about it. It's kind of pretty high level question, right?  in your question, you are close to couple of my points that I would actually make to answer it. Beginning with -- just to be clear, I'm not going to give guidance for next year. 38:01 There are a lot of moving parts, things are fluid. We are right in the middle of putting together our budgets for next year right now. As we said in the call, our long -- we're very confident about our algorithm over the long term. I'm just not ready to talk about it in twenty twenty two, specifically just yet. But in our prepared remarks, I did say we expect growth in both segments. And so, I'll start there and then I'll bring it back to profit. 38:34 Our -- McCormick is unique and that we've been differentiated by strong growth as underlying trends that support our business includes demographic tailwind from younger consumers that has nothing to do with the pandemic and then many of the consumption trends we believe were reinforce and accelerated by the pandemic. So we believe that going into the pandemic, our growth was differentiated already through it, it's been differentiated and coming out, but it continues to be differentiated that we paid investments including during the time of this pandemic, both organic and through smart acquisitions that put our portfolio more and more into high growth categories like hot sauce and flavor. 39:21 And on top of this, we're trying to have the top line benefit of pricing in twenty twenty two. So we are confidence in strong growth going forward. For operating profit there are a lot of puts and takes. Over the last few years we've had rising ERP investments, over the last two we've had the shock of extraordinary COVID cost and right now, we as everyone else not just in our industry, but across business in general are wrestling with decades high inflation. And that's everywhere, we're not unique The first two of these rising European investments versus COVID costs should largely offset in twenty twenty two. And I think just given the magnitude of the cost that we've described previously, everyone should have an expectation around those largely offsetting. 40:16 And first, the cost pricing is going to kick it, pricing has lagged, we have our pricing in the U.S. largely going into effect in fourth quarter, in particular. And so, I would expect that we would see \u2013 you should expect to see the benefits from that, not just in the top line, but running it through the P&L. But remember, the math says that margins compression take pricing, our approach is to take pricing to pass through costs and so the both the numerator and denominator go up and so the fraction gets a little bit smaller. 40:58 So while we do expect that pricing to come in, it would be reasonable to expect some level of margin compression. Nonetheless, with the pricing action and other steps we will take to offset cost and the top line growth that we expect, I think it's very reasonable to expect solid operating profit growth next year. I'm not ready yet to say if it's exactly on algorithm. 41:50 It actually did have an impact on the fourth quarter. I think -- sorry, I said forth, I misspoke there, it's third quarter. And we haven't quantified that and I'm not prepared to, but it was material. We normally would not have a backlog at all to have -- the idea of having a backlog of orders is unprecedented, we have backlog that's measurable in days. And so it did have a \u2013 it definitely had an impact. It would have been our hope to actually continue to rebuild trade inventories as we went through the quarter which have not yet been fully recovered and we were not able to do so. We really wanted and planned to ship of more of these logistics challenges are very real -- we've got a very strategic discussion just now and a very tactical one. But just simply getting product out there has been a challenge in the face of the -- but it's still very high demand at the same time that we're having these logistical challenges. I'd say that the trade channels are still a bit starved for inventory. 44:04 Well, first of all, I won't say that there's particular problem, these actions always have some degree of commercial tension in them and so I don't want to get too specific there. As such, there are ongoing conversations with customers, I think that there are some new conversations that we had. All of our actions on pricing are on track. Particularly for the U.S. the price increases that we talked about earlier year in the year have been solved in. 44:41 There is a time lag though, especially with how quickly cost have gone up. The inflation is accelerated since we launched those pricing. So there's more work to do in that area in twenty twenty two. Phasing of most of our actions is happening in Q4 and we would expect to see the benefit of that in twenty twenty two. 46:40 Well again, I'm going to say that, I can't give specific about any one particular customer, certainly the pricing actions that we just took, we had a lot of company going out there. And so I think retailers -- what they heard from us was similar to what they heard from others. I'm not so sure, we have gotten that kind of feedback that retailers thinks that these increases our transitory. 47:09 There's been some discussion about inflation not continuing to escalate, but there hasn't been any discussion about this not being reset of pricing levels. And I think that there's broad recognition of that and I will say that I was on a call with  yesterday, where he was saying very much the same thing. And so I think that the outlook is that these costs are not transient, they are here to stay and they're potentially going to have to find their way through in the form of pricing that gets to the consumer. And bell tightening across the entire supply chain, including us as a supplier to our customer. 48:10 Yeah. I'm not \u2013 I'm not differentiating between the two right now. I think if i got much further than that I'm getting into too specific that are good to  two perspective. 48:32 Just like us, he has got to do it in a public form, so it's all out there. 48:49 Good morning. And I'll just add to that, the cost increase that we're talking about are -- these are not things that are unique to McCormick at all. The biggest increases has been on packaged materials and on transportation costs followed by raw material and labor. And I'd say that we look lot like everybody else in that regard. 52:08 Adam, we're going to have to bring you in to help write some of our IR materials. The -- we are very confident in the margin trajectory of our Flavor Solutions business. We are really changing the portfolio, the big driver of our margin improvement over time has been the shift in the portfolio, there's more value added technically insulated products, we place investments in that part of the business, we've done acquisitions in that part of the business to accelerate the growth. And as the portfolio continues to shift in that direction, it's going to drive really a structural improvement in margin. Those are just categories that command a better margin and it's going to mix the business up. And at the same time, we've made decision to get out of some of the lower margin stuff, some of which is really low margin. And we've found graceful ways of exiting some of that without getting on the wrong side of customer relationships. 53:20 So, I'd say, our long term outlook for continued expansion of our flavor solution is one of the things that underpins our confidence are long term algorithm. 53:43 And there's been a number of notes that we are going to try and parse it. Organic sales out from an acquisition and so on. We're are reporting one hundred percent of what we sell in FONA as acquisition related, but we have grown that business tremendously since we bought it. And we're very \u2013 and same with Cholula as well. But your question specifically is about flavor solutions and that's really part of that portfolio migration. 54:27 Good morning. 54:41 I'm going to say that all of the levers that we're going to pull well. But part of what CCI does is offset inflation to an extent, part of it offsets cost increases and part of it we bring into reinvest in the business in otherwise, hence part of it makes its way to the bottom line and that's the intend. So we are expecting that over time we will recover all of the costs, all of the levers, it won't be one hundred percent in pricing. 55:37 I think that -- I don't want to get too deep into to talking about twenty twenty two. I did want to give guidance for the year, and I don't want to give guidance for any the quarter. 56:49 If you do the math, Chris, looking back two years. So look at the underserved twenty nineteen. Last year, you're right, we weren't shipping the consumption, demand was extraordinarily elevated. And if you strip out the acquisition, you have demand, consumption is up nineteen percent, our shipments are up thirteen. So this rate map on that would suggest we under-shipped by about six percentage points, which is very substantial. We did that's same math in Q2 and we were ahead by four. So it looks like we -- some of the -- some of the inventory build that we did. But in twenty nineteen we have holiday terms program in place, which we normally would do. Normally in the third quarter we're starting to build trade inventories for the heavy fall season. 57:37 And so that would have been part of the underlying demand. So when you net that all out, we think we're pretty close to even on shipping versus the true change in consumption. But that includes not being able to build trade inventories for the holidays as we would have hoped. And so we do think that we're -- as I said -- one of the questions earlier that, the trade channel right now is bit starved for inventory in the U.S.. Now we think of that as really slashing between third and fourth quarter and it's still going to end up getting captured within the year. 58:30 So it doesn't much change our outlook for the full year, it makes us anticipate a pretty strong -- pretty strong fourth quarter. But to ramp back to where we are on rebuilding, we're not as far along as we would have hoped. Yes, it's a great question. And obviously, we talk about this actually at our 10-Q disclosure. Now we talk about kind of a underlying rate of twenty four percent to twenty five percent based on country mix, the underlying tax rates that we have and our expectations for the year. And generally what happens and what happened this quarter, there are discrete either programs or tax team runs, there are acquisitions in the past that we clean up some of the assumptions or estimates or there's statute to limitations that drop off where we've tended to realize some discrete tax benefits. So it's exactly what happened this quarter, but under the current tax regime, with Guilty and Citi and all these things globally, it's twenty four percent to twenty five percent. Obviously, we're all waiting to see what happens in Washington to see what future rates are. And I'd say our cash taxes are pretty close to that too. 62:47 Sure. Well, generally across all categories, private label has loss share in the pandemic  as a group have gained and then recent results that we just announced, our brands were strong private labels . When it comes to pricing, that costs are going up for every raw materials, packaging, labor and transportation and that applies for private label as well and so pricing actions that we are going forward are including the private label products that we manufacture and I would expect that in many cases, just because the price at a lower price point that they may see a higher percentage inflation rate because of the same costs flow through, but it's going to be a bigger percentage. 64:32 Sure. The demand remains elevated, our categories for -- we're already growing before the pandemic and we need to growth through it and there's \u2013 we have talked endlessly about the underlying demand for flavor growing, the younger consumers are fueling that. And as we've gone through the pandemic, we've gained household penetration, usage rates are up and we haven't talked about it much, but we -- I think we had a comment about it in the prepared remarks that purchases per purchase occasion are up a lot. And so consumers are buying more of our products and we expect that to continue to be the case. So I'd say our outlook continue to be positive for strong sales growth. 65:27 And if you look at consensus sales for next year that are out there, they're pretty anemic and I guess we're trying to definitely suggest that there's a reason to reconsider that. 66:19 It's a very call number overall compared to our branded portfolio change, it's definitely less than one percent differential. 66:42 Oh my gosh, we are out of questions. Great. Thanks everyone for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and the reach of a balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. Very are very pleased with our outstanding year to date operating performance, which proves the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities as a company. Looking ahead, we expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on our strategy, actively respond to change consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities. Thank you for your time this morning."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "21:52 Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to twenty nineteen. 22:00 Starting on slide thirteen. Our top line growth continues to be strong. We grew constant currency sales five percent during the third quarter compared to last year with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing four percent across both segments. Our volume and mix drove our organic sales increase with Flavor Solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment. 22:22 Versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen, we grew sales fifteen percent in constant currency with both segments growing double digits. During the third quarter, our consumer segment continued to lap last year's exceptionally high demand. Versus twenty twenty, our third quarter consumer segment sales declined one percent in constant currency, which includes a three percent increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen, consumer segment sales grew fourteen percent in constant currency. 22:53 On slide fourteen, consumer segment sales in the Americas declined one percent in constant currency, lapping the elevated lockdown demand in the year ago period. As well as the logistics challenges Lawrence mentioned earlier. Incremental sales from the Cholula acquisition contributed three percent growth. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen sales increased seventeen percent in constant currency, led by significant growth in the McCormick, Lawry's, Grill Mates, OLD BAY, Frank's RedHot, Cholula, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden, Simply Asia, Stubb's and all  branded products. That's a lot of brands. Partially offset by a decline in private label. 23:33 In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined eleven percent from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes strong growth in our Eastern European market. On top of their significant volume growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the regions other markets. On a two year basis, sales increased ten percent in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our Kamis, Schwartz and Frank's RedHot branded products. 24:02 Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased eleven percent in constant currency due to the recovery of branded food service sales with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales increased four percent compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen including a sales decline in India resulting from a slower COVID-nineteen recovery. 24:26 Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and slide seventeen, we grew third quarter constant currency sales to seventeen percent, including an eight percent increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year over year increase led by the Americas and EMEA regions was due to strong growth, with both packaged food and beverage customers and in away from home products. Compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen Flavor Solutions segment sales grew sixteen percent in constant currency. 24:56 In the Americas Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew nineteen percent year over year with FONA and Cholula contributing twelve percent. Volume and product mix increased, driven by significantly higher sales through branded food service customers together with growth to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasoning. 25:16 On a two year basis, sales increased fifteen percent in constant currency versus twenty nineteen with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business. 25:30 In EMEA, constant currency sales grew nineteen percent compared to last year, due to increased sales to QSRs and branded food service customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased twenty three percent versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. 25:55 In the Asia Pacific Region, Flavor Solutions sales rose one percent in constant currency versus last year, and increased eight percent in constant currency versus the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Both driven by QSR growth and partially impact by the timing of our customers limited time offers and promotional activities. 26:15 As seen on slide twenty one, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a three percent favorable impact from currency. 26:32 Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined ten percent to one hundred and eighty million dollars, growing constant currency twelve percent, driven by the cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges, partially offset by CCI led cost savings. 26:48 These logistics challenges not only impacted costs, but also negatively impacted sales. In the flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose thirty two percent to eighty four million dollars or twenty seven percent in constant currency. Higher sales, CPI led cost savings and favorable product mix as we continue to migrate our portfolio more than offset the cost pressures in this segment. 27:14 Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERO program was offset by lower COVID-nineteen costs compared to last year. During the quarter, we invested in brand marketing ahead of last year and notably, we have increased our investments eleven percent on a year to date basis. 27:33 As seen on slide twenty two, adjusted gross profit margin declined two sixty basis points driven primarily by the cost pressures we are experiencing and the lag in pricing. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined one hundred and ten basis points driven by leverage from sales growth. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of one hundred and fifty basis points. In addition to the factors I mentioned a few moments ago, a sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both gross and operating margins. 28:08 Turning to income taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was fourteen point one percent compared to nineteen point three percent in the year ago period. Both period were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with the larger impact this year due to the favorable impact of a reversal of a tax accrual. 28:29 Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined five percent versus the third quarter of twenty twenty. Based on our year to date results, we now expect a mid-single digit increase in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations for twenty twenty one, up from our previous projection of a low single digit decrease. This improvement is driven by strong performance from our McCormick Mexico joint venture. 28:55 At the bottom line, as shown on slide twenty five, third quarter twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share was zero point eight zero dollars compared to zero point seven six dollars for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by a lower adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the third quarter of twenty nineteen, our ten percent increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by sales growth. 29:20 On slide twenty six, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the third quarter of twenty twenty one, our cash flow from operations was three seventy three million dollars, which is lower than the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction and integration costs and higher use of cash associated with working capital. This includes the impact of planned higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues, as well as buffer against cost volatility. 29:57 Through the third quarter, we've returned two seventy two million dollars of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used one hundred and ninety million dollars for capital expenditures. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 30:21 Now turning to our twenty twenty one financial outlook on slides twenty seven and twenty eight. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and underlying performance, tempered by the higher inflation ahead of pricing, and the logistic challenges we previously mentioned. 30:45 For twenty twenty one, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-nineteen costs and ERP investment, as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We continue to expect an estimated three percentage point favorable impact from currency rates on sales. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a two percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. 31:18 At the top line, due to our strong year to date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales nine percent to ten percent, which is the high end of our previous projection of eight percent to ten percent and includes a four percent incremental impact from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 31:39 We had initially projected an incremental acquisition impact in the range of three point five percent to four percent. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing and new products, as well as pricing. 31:58 We are now projecting our twenty twenty one adjusted gross profit margin to be one hundred and fifty points to one hundred and seventy basis points lower than twenty twenty due to the increasing cost pressures I mentioned earlier. While we continue to expect a mid-single digit increase in inflation for the year, it has moved higher and is now approaching a double digit increase in the fourth quarter. 32:20 Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, cost inflation and COVID-nineteen costs, partially offset by pricing and margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 32:36 As a reminder, we priced to offset cost increases, we do not margin out. Our estimate for COVID-nineteen cost remains unchanged at sixty million dollars in twenty twenty one versus fifty million dollars in twenty twenty and is weighted to the first half of the year. 32:54 Reflecting the change in gross profit margin outlook, we are lowering our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be eight percent to ten percent constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges, and partially offset by a one percent reduction from increased COVID-nineteen costs compared to twenty twenty and a three percent reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. 33:29 This result in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of four percent to six percent in constant currency. This projection includes the mid-single digit inflationary pressure as well as our  cost savings target of approximately one hundred and ten million dollars. It also includes an expected low single digit increase in brand marketing investments. 33:51 Considering the year to date impact from discrete items, we now project our twenty twenty one adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately twenty one percent as compared to our previous projection of twenty three percent. This outlook versus our twenty twenty adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately one percent. 34:15 We are lowering our twenty twenty one adjusted earnings per share expectations to five percent to seven percent growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income tax rate, as well as the higher adjusted income from unconsolidated operations. 34:35 Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in twenty twenty one is now two point nine seven dollars to three point zero two dollars. This compares to two point eight three dollars of adjusted earnings per share in twenty twenty and represents eight percent to ten percent growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to COVID-nineteen costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. 35:02 I'll now turn it back to Lawrence. 36:53 Good morning, Andrew. 43:12 We've noticed -- we didn't narrow our range on sales to the high end of the range. So we have very strong confidence in the fourth quarter. 45:11 And I think I'd point you back Ken to historical perspective here. We had high inflationary periods in the past in the two thousand and eight, two thousand and nine timeframe, two thousand eleven, two thousand and twelve we are being successfully put in pricing, it's actually both  U.S. consumer during one of those time periods and we're able to pass through the pricing. We also pulled a lot of other levers whether it's CCI, discretionary spending to get to Andrew's point about getting back on algorithm from a profit perspective. 48:50 Good morning. Hey, Adam, this is Mike. I'll take this first and Lawrence may add few comments. I mean, like we said on the call today, you're right, it's -- eighty percent to ninety percent of this is really logistics, transportation, packaging, things like that. So we have a really good line of sight to our commodity costs in the fourth quarter, obviously. 49:43 It's really both ocean freight, but also domestic freight. You've actually seen after Hurricane Ida, some of the domestic rates have gone up again. So that's part of the new news, and I think we're all experiencing in the U.S, in particular. You've seen globally in the UK natural gas challenges and things like that too and trucking challenges. So, it's both getting it here and getting it to customers. If on a wage rate perspective, we've taken actions just like other companies have to aggressively attract talent in our manufacturing facilities and DCs with retention bonuses and other actions like that. So I think to Lawrence's point, these labor rates aren't going to go back down, there's been a reset of cost level that may not escalate further, that's to be seen, but it's not -- we're not going to have deflation on labor rates. 53:33 I think the FONA acquisition has even gave us more confidence and continuing to migrate that portfolio with really combining their technical expertise with ours. w: 56:04 And also you realize that there's a lot of focus on the U.S. timing, but this happens around the world at different time points based on local. So we'll have a lot more to say in the January call. 59:58 I mean, obviously, I mean a lot of depends on the future cost environment too in this. I mean, we put in pricing in the U.S. to just kind of going to partially hit in the fourth quarter like we said last quarter. The full impact is going to be in twenty twenty two. Now, if costs continue to accelerate, we'll have to address that with other actions. But I think it's speculative at this point to try to call twenty two. And the timing is by quarter and by halves,"

        "content": "Kasey Jenkins: Good morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. We will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO and will close with a question-and-answer session. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted income from unconsolidated operations and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA and a gain realized upon the sale of our unconsolidated operations. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth, performance, and people strategies while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick to emerge stronger from the crisis. We continue to execute from a position of strength with the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made, and the capabilities we have built as an organization. Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on, and the effective execution of those strategies as well as our recent acquisitions of two fantastic businesses, and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year. Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflect our robust growth momentum on a two-year basis as seen on Slide 4. We delivered significant double-digit two-year growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income, and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins. Even considering increased COVID-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments, we are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategies actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities. We are emerging stronger. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory, and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers, and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment as evidenced again by our second quarter results. During last year\u2019s second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers\u2019 cooking and eating more at home, at-home consumption resulting in a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. Last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. Our second quarter performance was very strong. Starting with our top line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with flavor solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment versus the second quarter of 2019 we grew sales 18% in constant currency. During the second quarter, our consumer segment lapped exceptionally high demand for our products driven by the surge in consumers cooking more at home at the onset of the pandemic. As such, versus last year, our second quarter Consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency. On Slide 18, consumer segment sales in the Americas lapping the demand surge in the year-ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of Cholula. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency, with significant broad-based growth across the McCormick branded portfolio. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes growth in our UK and Eastern European markets on top of their significant growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region\u2019s other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in Wuhan last year, with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 21, we grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher sales of away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with FONA and Cholula contributing 13%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers as well as growth to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings and beverages. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business. In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and QSR customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year, led by growth with QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to new products and our customers\u2019 limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns in countries outside of China in the year ago period. Sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019. As seen on Slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency, 4% in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency, 26%, driven by \u2013 primarily by lower sales. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales. Both segments were favorably impacted by product mix and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from cost inflation, including transportation costs. COVID-19-related costs were comparable to the year-ago period. Additionally, in the consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% from the second quarter of last year. As seen on Slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points, with the increase in brand marketing, partially offset by leverage from sales growth. Adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margin declined by 200 basis points. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both margins. Importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points, even considering incremental COVID-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments. Turning to income taxes, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact last year due to discrete tax item related to the refinement of our entity structure. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of March, we completed the sale of our minority stake in Eastern Condiments, one of our joint ventures in India.  For 2021, we now expect a low single-digit decline in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, partially due to the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern. Previously, we were projecting a low single-digit increase. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 29, second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by a higher adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share. On Slide 30, we\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021 compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020. This change primarily resulted from a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. We returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 31 and 32, with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously. This includes the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions projected to be at the high end of the 3.5% to 4% range. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and our customer engagement growth plans. Pricing taken to partially offset cost inflation is also expected to contribute to sales growth. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020. Our previous projection was comparable to 2020. We are increasing our inflation expectation for the year to a mid-single-digit increase as compared to a low single-digit increase previously. Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, COVID-19 costs and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing as well as margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Reflecting the changes in our sales and gross profit margin outlooks, we are increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth. Partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency. This projection includes the inflationary pressure, I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments. We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, as I mentioned earlier. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax segment. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 33. In the second quarter, we drove exceptional growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. We delivered significant double-digit year-to-date and 2-year growth rates for sales and profit, reflecting a robust growth momentum. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic, and we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term consumer trends which accelerated during the pandemic while continuing the momentum we are gaining in away-from-home consumption. Our enthusiasm for Cholula and FONA and our confidence we will deliver on our plants has only strengthened. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also investing for the future growth we expect. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond. And now, let\u2019s turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Andrew. Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. One question to start off with, I know that the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve talked about how some markets that have recovered more fully. So let\u2019s say, you know China or in Australia, you\u2019ve had still elevated consumption trends for the at-home business even as the Away-From-Home business has essentially fully recovered. And I just wanted to get a sense of, do you still believe or do you believe that, that represents a reasonably good gauge for how we should expect trends to play out here in the U.S. or maybe are there some discrete differences between these markets in that regard that you would want to highlight? And then I just got a quick follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. Sure, Andrew. Well, first of all, we do continue to expect consumer demand for at-home cooking products to remain elevated coming out of the pandemic. We\u2019re certainly seeing that all over the world. Our research and survey data with consumers that we commented on just a few minutes ago, all points in that direction and the behavior seems to be bearing it out. Of course, in this quarter, in many developed markets, we\u2019re lapping extraordinary consumption when lockdowns were heavily placed for the first time. But even in each market, in this time, if you look at the stack two year, you see consumption is still up very dramatically versus then. And just all indications are that, that\u2019s going to be the case. We are seeing foodservice recover, and it is a bit of a paradox that consumer consumption at-home seems to be remaining high and food service is recovering. We don\u2019t believe that people are eating more, but we do believe that they are cooking more, and that benefits our more ingredient-based flavor products.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks for that. And then just focusing, I guess, specifically on the part of your Flavor Solutions segment that is \u2013 that our sales to other CPG companies. I guess I\u2019m curious if we think towards the back half of the year, would you anticipate that part of your business to be up year-over-year just based on the elevated consumption levels that we\u2019re continuing to see for some other CPG names in the packaged food and beverage space?\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. Well, without trying to dissect Flavor Solutions too much. Yes, first of all, that part of the business had largely returned to its normal growth rate towards the end of last year. It has been strong through this year. But within our portfolio, you can\u2019t miss the fact that we\u2019ve done a big acquisition in that Flavor Solutions space, and we are seeing a different mix of products as well, tremendous growth of beverages and innovation around hard seltzers and things like that. We \u2013 with FONA in particular, we tapped into a whole new addressable market around nutrition and health products. So, the portfolio migration is a big driver of our ongoing results in that part of the portfolio as well.\nMike Smith: That\u2019s really part of our long-term strategy to migrate the Flavor Solutions portfolio to these high-growth categories like beverages.\nAndrew Lazar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nKen Goldman: I wanted to ask \u2013 I wanted to ask about the status of inventories in U.S. consumer. I think you talked about them being relatively high or low rather last quarter, and the rest of the year there will be a little bit of a build there. I am just curious where do you think those inventories stand now? Did the rebuild help a lot in 2Q? I didn\u2019t necessarily hear you quantify that. So, I just wanted a little bit of an update there, if possible?\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Ken. And I am glad to do that, and I will try to quantify it as well here in Q2. Well, first of all, this is an Americas consumer issue. We are shipping to consumption and have been in the rest of the world. Our Flavor Solutions isn\u2019t impacted by this on the Americas consumer. We weren\u2019t able to keep up with the sustained demand, and so trade inventories, and perhaps the consumer pantries have been depleted. And so there has been a need to do a rebuild. You all saw on the shelf that, especially as we came through the end of last year, the shelves looked pretty rough. A number of you on the call, and Ken, I think maybe you\u2019ve also written about TDPs  and so on. But, we are about 90% of the way to restoring the shelf. We really ended suspensions. We still have a few products on allocation, and demand has continued to be really strong. So, we are in some cases, very much hand to mouth on some products. Old Bay is a product that requires a lot of blending capacity. And so, we are a bit hand to mouth on that one, believe it or not. But in terms of restocking the shelf, honestly, I wish we have done a little bit more in the second quarter. I said we are at 90%. We would have really hoped to have it all done, and there is still more work to do because the demand has just continued to remain high through this period. If you just do the math, there is a lot of noise in the year ago numbers. So if you take it back to \u201920, and then a year ago, consumption was up tremendously, but we couldn\u2019t ship to that. Our shipments flagged a lot. So if we compare back to 2019, our consumption is up in second quarter, 18% versus 2019. Our organic sales, stripping out acquisitions are up 22%. I would suggest there is about a 4% inventory rebuilding impact in the second quarter on our Americas consumer business. So, it was a factor. It\u2019s not as big as I think a lot of people have it in their mind.\nKen Goldman: Perfect. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to ask \u2013 that was helpful. I wanted to ask on Flavor Solutions. The margin did improve nicely year-on-year, but still down over 100 basis points versus 2019, even though your organic sales were up over that time. I realize we are a little bit apples-to-oranges here. You have added some businesses, but just curiously, how are you thinking about I guess, the drivers of the margin recovery from here and maybe the pace of margin recovery over the next couple of quarters?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, as you say, I think, Ken, this is Mike. I mean we had a large recovery on the margin last year because it pretty much lapped what we did in the second quarter of the prior year. I think the reality of this as some costs go up as we pass through pricing, you are going to have a natural compression in the Flavor Solutions business, which we have seen in the past as we pass through penny cost, as we said. COVID cost obviously hit us in the second quarter, although we were comparable to last year overall, but there was some segment mix there. We do feel too within the Flavor Solutions category though, we \u2013 one with FONA, that\u2019s a nice margin bump. But even within the product portfolio, we see some margin positive as we migrate the business. So, as we grow sales more and get that \u2013 get more leverage to the rest of the year, because we are lapping a pretty soft second six last year, we are hopeful that will improve, too.\nKen Goldman: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. I want to know in the Americas, we have heard through in the industry that it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to negotiate with retailers on merchandising and pricing if you have had continued supply problems. Maybe your category is different and because of your leadership, it\u2019s different. But what have the conversations been regarding that with your retailer customers? Has it compromised you at all in getting done what you need to get done?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I don\u2019t want to get too specific about our conversations with customers on pricing. There is always an amount of commercial tension in our pricing discussions, but we are really confident that we are going to be able to get through the pricing that we need. We take a long-term perspective with our customers. They know that we are fair that we are transparent in our cost. There is broad based inflation that\u2019s recognized by everybody. It\u2019s not just us that\u2019s going up in isolation that\u2019s full industry is moving. And so we are pretty confident that we are going to be able to take the pricing that we need. We are going to use all of the levers that we have to address costs. So, pricing certainly has to be part of the solution. But cost savings and revenue management are going to factor in the dealing with the inflation issue. And I think we have pretty strong confidence that these discussions are going to be positive. I think too, we are continuing to invest in our brands. We are \u2013 most of the share of voice in the category, which our customers know that. And you saw year-to-date we are up nicely in A&P. And again into the third quarter, so that is supporting their business, too.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And a follow-up question, maybe just for modeling, Mike. Can third quarter profits still be up year-over-year, because you mentioned that there is going to be a lag effect on inflation? I just want to make sure we are getting the phasing right. And then I would imagine fourth quarter, do you have a very easy comparison to a year ago because of the inventory, because of the supply chain shortages a year ago?\nMike Smith: It\u2019s \u2013 you are right, we are lapping a third quarter \u2013 a strong third quarter last year, we had about 8% total growth at 9% constant currency. And the consumer business was stronger compared to flavor last year. So, from a segment mix perspective is a little bit of a headwind in the third quarter. And you are right, the lagging of pricing does help the fourth quarter. We are also, as I just mentioned, higher brand marking in the third. Because if you remember, last year, in the fourth quarter, we had \u2013 I think it was around a 20% A&P increase, which was continued in Q1 and Q2. So, it would be an easier fourth quarter comparison from an A&P perspective. And a little bit from the sales, of sales in the fourth quarter for the company. We are below that 9% constant currency I mentioned before.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think Mike is talking about kind of the shape because try to avoid giving too specific \u2013 any particular quarter. Now these are our biggest quarters of the year coming up and so part of our thinking as we set guidance for the year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Well. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hello Alexia. Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: So, I guess picking up on some earlier questions, are you able to sort of quantify what your input cost inflation outlook looks like at the moment? Are we talking about mid-single digit COGS inflation, perhaps including the freight component as well. I just want to get a sense of the order of magnitude there? And then I have a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Alexia. Yes. Our previous guidance was low-single digit. We have moved that to mid-single digit. And as we said on the call, I mean the three components, obviously, the freight in the ocean freight we have talked about, which is hitting everyone. We source a lot of our products in the Asian market. So, those rates are up, but also packaging due to resin costs and things like that going up. And then thirdly, commodities. But yes, low-single digit to mid-single digit now for this year.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then I am just curious about the market share trends that we are seeing in the U.S. Nielsen data. It looks as though there is some sell-off happening on the core herbs and spices area. Am I right in that? And do you expect that to correct going forward or is it just because of strange comparisons from the year ago period at this point?\nLawrence Kurzius: It\u2019s a little bit of both. And so the \u2013 so first, yes, we do expect that to turn positive. In the year ago period, we had heavy supply, heavy through second quarter, we were in a great stock position. We were building inventory for an ERP pilot. And so we had unusually high stock levels of finished goods ourselves going when the crisis hit, which enabled us to have extraordinary supply in the early weeks of the pandemic. I will say, by the end of second quarter, it was a very different situation, but going into the quarter, it was strong. And so our shelf position was really advantaged. And then, of course, we went through a long period where we weren\u2019t able to meet the demand and our shelf position deteriorated. We had to suspend items, put them on allocation, stop promotion and so on. And our total distribution points declined as a result. And \u2013 and so we are comparing against a period of unusual strength at retail and in the year ago period and in this period, we have got a time when we are rebuilding that shelf position pretty much everywhere where we have been able to have good supply and good service to our customers. Our share has grown, not declined. That\u2019s the case across our markets in Europe. That\u2019s the case in some categories here in the U.S. The real pressure point has been herbs and spices and recipe mixes, where just the extraordinary demand ran down the shelf. And as we restore it, we are confident that our share position is going to improve.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: I want to maybe think a little bit longer term and some of the kind of key takeaways and points you have been highlighting on the call have talked about the increases in at-home consumption. Could have some staying power and that uniquely benefits your portfolio. And I am wondering how, if at all, that makes you think about the long-term organic sales potential of the business. I mean you have a long-term 4% to 6% sales growth algorithm that encompasses a little bit of M&A over time. So, 2% to 5% organic embedded in that. To do the changes in consumption post pandemic make you think that, that long-term organic sales growth potential could be higher or \u2013 and if not, why?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I don\u2019t think we are going to raise our long-term guidance today. But with our confidence in that long-term guidance is really reinforced by what we are seeing. I mean there has been a lot of talk about the changes in consumer behavior, but really is an amplification of trends that were already in place that we believe our long-term secular trends that underlie our growth and that our strategies are designed to capitalize on and the global demand for flavor has been growing steadily for I don\u2019t even know how long. It\u2019s a tremendous amount, your monitor projects global flavor demand to grow the 6% rate going forward for the next 5 years. And that is really the foundation for our sales growth. And then if you just think about compared to 2019, underlying global demand for flavor growing in the absence of a pandemic, 6% CAGR, you would expect us to be up 12%. So, I think that the performance that you are seeing is really more of a bleed through of what you are going to see in a post-pandemic world, consumers for cooking at home more before the pandemic. We believe that, that was accelerated that people \u2013 a lot of lapsed cooks had the opportunity to cook. Everyone learned their grandma and mother\u2019s secret recipes and then how to prepare them, someone in every household has become a very proficient. And it\u2019s been a positive experience for people. They have an outlet for creativity. It\u2019s brought families together, and we think that this is a behavior that is going to be sticky. Younger consumers, in particular, have leaning towards healthy, flavorful, more scratch cooking and in particular, among Gen Z, a return to trusted brands and brands with some nostalgia, we think that these are really long-term demographic trends that are going to benefit us for a long time. So, our confidence in our long-term guidance is to reinforce of what we are seeing happen right now.\nMike Smith: Yes, I think, too, I mean another testament to our broad-based differentiated portfolio. But if you add them to your question about our 4% to 6% constant currency long-term growth of which a third of that is M&A. So you bolt on M&A, you take that out. So, you are kind of highlighting a 2.5% to 4% is our long-term guidance. Last year, constant currency organic growth was 5%. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is around 5%, too. So, we are seeing \u2013 I think Lawrence, the acceleration of those trends is reinforcing our belief on that organic growth of our long-term guidance.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up just a modeling question trying to Rob\u2019s question a little bit differently. Just remind us the $30 million or so \u2013 of ERP expenses headwind year-on-year? How much of that\u2019s been already incurred in the first half of the year and $50 million of COVID-related expenses that you expect in fiscal \u201821, how much has been already incurred year-to-date, just so we are thinking about the first half phasing?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. The ERP is mostly going to be a second half headwind and very little impact year-on-year in the first half. From a COVID perspective, we had guided to $60 million for this year versus $50 million last year, and that\u2019s mostly been occurred in the first half.\nAdam Samuelson: Got it. Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hi guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Mike, the gross margin, just wanted to go back there, the commentary or the new guidance on kind of 80 bps to 100 bps lower. It sounded like in your comments that actually mix or sales mix moving back to Flavor Solutions might have been a bigger impact actually than cost inflation. So, I wanted to clarify that comment. And just if there is kind of a way to break out those two kind of how they impact between mix and the cost inflation?\nMike Smith: Yes. Really, in the second quarter, it was mainly segment mix as we said. I mean the costs have been rising, but we have taken some pricing \u2013 but it\u2019s really around segment mix in Q2. It changed a little bit in the second six, as we have guided gross margin probably between 90 basis point and 120 basis points if you do the squeeze on the gross margin, two-thirds of that is really \u2013 you are raising sales due to some pricing offsetting inflation and the FX piece, it\u2019s not dropped through the profits. So, that\u2019s about two-thirds of that compression. The other third is some of the lag in the pricing, costs are coming through in the third quarter. We got pricing a little later. So, it\u2019s a little bit of that, but it\u2019s basically two-thirds due to mass and a third due to kind of the timing of the price.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just two more quick modeling questions. I didn\u2019t see in the guidance anything on capital spend for the year or interest expense as well?\nMike Smith: Yes. We don\u2019t \u2013 I mean you will see in the Q coming out today, capital hasn\u2019t changed from last quarter. What was the question so we don\u2019t give interest guidance.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Kurzius for any final comments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today\u2019s call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth of reach of our balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. We are very pleased with our outstanding year-to-date operating performance which proves the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company. We expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on our long-term growth, performance and people strategies actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities. Our investments provide a new foundation for growth while enhancing our agility and our relevance with our consumers and customers, which when combined with our dedicated and engaged employees, positions us well for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation. For everyone listening in the U.S., I hope your 4th of July plans include getting together around the grills with friends and family and enjoying some Montreal Steak Seasoning, French\u2019s Mustard and Stubbs barbecues.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence and thank you to everyone for joining today\u2019s call. And for those of you that might be joining from Canada, Happy Canada Day today. If you have any further questions regarding today\u2019s information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes this morning\u2019s call. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth, performance, and people strategies while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick to emerge stronger from the crisis. We continue to execute from a position of strength with the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made, and the capabilities we have built as an organization. Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on, and the effective execution of those strategies as well as our recent acquisitions of two fantastic businesses, and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year. Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflect our robust growth momentum on a two-year basis as seen on Slide 4. We delivered significant double-digit two-year growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income, and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins. Even considering increased COVID-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments, we are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategies actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities. We are emerging stronger. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory, and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers, and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment as evidenced again by our second quarter results. During last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers' cooking and eating more at home, at-home consumption resulting in a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. Last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 33. In the second quarter, we drove exceptional growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. We delivered significant double-digit year-to-date and 2-year growth rates for sales and profit, reflecting a robust growth momentum. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic, and we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term consumer trends which accelerated during the pandemic while continuing the momentum we are gaining in away-from-home consumption. Our enthusiasm for Cholula and FONA and our confidence we will deliver on our plants has only strengthened. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also investing for the future growth we expect. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond. And now, let's turn to your questions. Hi, Andrew. Good morning. Yes. Sure, Andrew. Well, first of all, we do continue to expect consumer demand for at-home cooking products to remain elevated coming out of the pandemic. We're certainly seeing that all over the world. Our research and survey data with consumers that we commented on just a few minutes ago, all points in that direction and the behavior seems to be bearing it out. Of course, in this quarter, in many developed markets, we're lapping extraordinary consumption when lockdowns were heavily placed for the first time. But even in each market, in this time, if you look at the stack two year, you see consumption is still up very dramatically versus then. And just all indications are that, that's going to be the case. We are seeing foodservice recover, and it is a bit of a paradox that consumer consumption at-home seems to be remaining high and food service is recovering. We don't believe that people are eating more, but we do believe that they are cooking more, and that benefits our more ingredient-based flavor products. Sure. Well, without trying to dissect Flavor Solutions too much. Yes, first of all, that part of the business had largely returned to its normal growth rate towards the end of last year. It has been strong through this year. But within our portfolio, you can't miss the fact that we've done a big acquisition in that Flavor Solutions space, and we are seeing a different mix of products as well, tremendous growth of beverages and innovation around hard seltzers and things like that. We \u2013 with FONA in particular, we tapped into a whole new addressable market around nutrition and health products. So, the portfolio migration is a big driver of our ongoing results in that part of the portfolio as well. Good morning. Sure, Ken. And I am glad to do that, and I will try to quantify it as well here in Q2. Well, first of all, this is an Americas consumer issue. We are shipping to consumption and have been in the rest of the world. Our Flavor Solutions isn't impacted by this on the Americas consumer. We weren't able to keep up with the sustained demand, and so trade inventories, and perhaps the consumer pantries have been depleted. And so there has been a need to do a rebuild. You all saw on the shelf that, especially as we came through the end of last year, the shelves looked pretty rough. A number of you on the call, and Ken, I think maybe you've also written about TDPs  and so on. But, we are about 90% of the way to restoring the shelf. We really ended suspensions. We still have a few products on allocation, and demand has continued to be really strong. So, we are in some cases, very much hand to mouth on some products. Old Bay is a product that requires a lot of blending capacity. And so, we are a bit hand to mouth on that one, believe it or not. But in terms of restocking the shelf, honestly, I wish we have done a little bit more in the second quarter. I said we are at 90%. We would have really hoped to have it all done, and there is still more work to do because the demand has just continued to remain high through this period. If you just do the math, there is a lot of noise in the year ago numbers. So if you take it back to '20, and then a year ago, consumption was up tremendously, but we couldn't ship to that. Our shipments flagged a lot. So if we compare back to 2019, our consumption is up in second quarter, 18% versus 2019. Our organic sales, stripping out acquisitions are up 22%. I would suggest there is about a 4% inventory rebuilding impact in the second quarter on our Americas consumer business. So, it was a factor. It's not as big as I think a lot of people have it in their mind. Well, I don't want to get too specific about our conversations with customers on pricing. There is always an amount of commercial tension in our pricing discussions, but we are really confident that we are going to be able to get through the pricing that we need. We take a long-term perspective with our customers. They know that we are fair that we are transparent in our cost. There is broad based inflation that's recognized by everybody. It's not just us that's going up in isolation that's full industry is moving. And so we are pretty confident that we are going to be able to take the pricing that we need. We are going to use all of the levers that we have to address costs. So, pricing certainly has to be part of the solution. But cost savings and revenue management are going to factor in the dealing with the inflation issue. And I think we have pretty strong confidence that these discussions are going to be positive. I think too, we are continuing to invest in our brands. We are \u2013 most of the share of voice in the category, which our customers know that. And you saw year-to-date we are up nicely in A&P. And again into the third quarter, so that is supporting their business, too. I think Mike is talking about kind of the shape because try to avoid giving too specific \u2013 any particular quarter. Now these are our biggest quarters of the year coming up and so part of our thinking as we set guidance for the year. Hello Alexia. Good morning. Sure, Alexia. Yes. Our previous guidance was low-single digit. We have moved that to mid-single digit. And as we said on the call, I mean the three components, obviously, the freight in the ocean freight we have talked about, which is hitting everyone. We source a lot of our products in the Asian market. So, those rates are up, but also packaging due to resin costs and things like that going up. And then thirdly, commodities. But yes, low-single digit to mid-single digit now for this year. It's a little bit of both. And so the \u2013 so first, yes, we do expect that to turn positive. In the year ago period, we had heavy supply, heavy through second quarter, we were in a great stock position. We were building inventory for an ERP pilot. And so we had unusually high stock levels of finished goods ourselves going when the crisis hit, which enabled us to have extraordinary supply in the early weeks of the pandemic. I will say, by the end of second quarter, it was a very different situation, but going into the quarter, it was strong. And so our shelf position was really advantaged. And then, of course, we went through a long period where we weren't able to meet the demand and our shelf position deteriorated. We had to suspend items, put them on allocation, stop promotion and so on. And our total distribution points declined as a result. And \u2013 and so we are comparing against a period of unusual strength at retail and in the year ago period and in this period, we have got a time when we are rebuilding that shelf position pretty much everywhere where we have been able to have good supply and good service to our customers. Our share has grown, not declined. That's the case across our markets in Europe. That's the case in some categories here in the U.S. The real pressure point has been herbs and spices and recipe mixes, where just the extraordinary demand ran down the shelf. And as we restore it, we are confident that our share position is going to improve. Good morning. Well, I don't think we are going to raise our long-term guidance today. But with our confidence in that long-term guidance is really reinforced by what we are seeing. I mean there has been a lot of talk about the changes in consumer behavior, but really is an amplification of trends that were already in place that we believe our long-term secular trends that underlie our growth and that our strategies are designed to capitalize on and the global demand for flavor has been growing steadily for I don't even know how long. It's a tremendous amount, your monitor projects global flavor demand to grow the 6% rate going forward for the next 5 years. And that is really the foundation for our sales growth. And then if you just think about compared to 2019, underlying global demand for flavor growing in the absence of a pandemic, 6% CAGR, you would expect us to be up 12%. So, I think that the performance that you are seeing is really more of a bleed through of what you are going to see in a post-pandemic world, consumers for cooking at home more before the pandemic. We believe that, that was accelerated that people \u2013 a lot of lapsed cooks had the opportunity to cook. Everyone learned their grandma and mother's secret recipes and then how to prepare them, someone in every household has become a very proficient. And it's been a positive experience for people. They have an outlet for creativity. It's brought families together, and we think that this is a behavior that is going to be sticky. Younger consumers, in particular, have leaning towards healthy, flavorful, more scratch cooking and in particular, among Gen Z, a return to trusted brands and brands with some nostalgia, we think that these are really long-term demographic trends that are going to benefit us for a long time. So, our confidence in our long-term guidance is to reinforce of what we are seeing happen right now. Yes. The ERP is mostly going to be a second half headwind and very little impact year-on-year in the first half. From a COVID perspective, we had guided to $60 million for this year versus $50 million last year, and that's mostly been occurred in the first half. Good morning Peter. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and for participating on today's call. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth of reach of our balanced portfolio, which has sustainably positioned us for growth. We are very pleased with our outstanding year-to-date operating performance which proves the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company.

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. Our second quarter performance was very strong. Starting with our top line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with flavor solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment versus the second quarter of 2019 we grew sales 18% in constant currency. During the second quarter, our consumer segment lapped exceptionally high demand for our products driven by the surge in consumers cooking more at home at the onset of the pandemic. As such, versus last year, our second quarter Consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency. On Slide 18, consumer segment sales in the Americas lapping the demand surge in the year-ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of Cholula. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency, with significant broad-based growth across the McCormick branded portfolio. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes growth in our UK and Eastern European markets on top of their significant growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in Wuhan last year, with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 21, we grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher sales of away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with FONA and Cholula contributing 13%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers as well as growth to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings and beverages. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business. In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and QSR customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year, led by growth with QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to new products and our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns in countries outside of China in the year ago period. Sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019. As seen on Slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency, 4% in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency, 26%, driven by \u2013 primarily by lower sales. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales. Both segments were favorably impacted by product mix and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from cost inflation, including transportation costs. COVID-19-related costs were comparable to the year-ago period. Additionally, in the consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% from the second quarter of last year. As seen on Slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points, with the increase in brand marketing, partially offset by leverage from sales growth. Adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margin declined by 200 basis points. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both margins. Importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points, even considering incremental COVID-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments. Turning to income taxes, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact last year due to discrete tax item related to the refinement of our entity structure. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of March, we completed the sale of our minority stake in Eastern Condiments, one of our joint ventures in India.  For 2021, we now expect a low single-digit decline in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, partially due to the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern. Previously, we were projecting a low single-digit increase. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 29, second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by a higher adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share. On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021 compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020. This change primarily resulted from a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. We returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 31 and 32, with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously. This includes the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions projected to be at the high end of the 3.5% to 4% range. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and our customer engagement growth plans. Pricing taken to partially offset cost inflation is also expected to contribute to sales growth. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020. Our previous projection was comparable to 2020. We are increasing our inflation expectation for the year to a mid-single-digit increase as compared to a low single-digit increase previously. Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, COVID-19 costs and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing as well as margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Reflecting the changes in our sales and gross profit margin outlooks, we are increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth. Partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency. This projection includes the inflationary pressure, I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments. We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, as I mentioned earlier. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax segment. I'll now turn it back to Lawrence. That's really part of our long-term strategy to migrate the Flavor Solutions portfolio to these high-growth categories like beverages. Yes. I mean, as you say, I think, Ken, this is Mike. I mean we had a large recovery on the margin last year because it pretty much lapped what we did in the second quarter of the prior year. I think the reality of this as some costs go up as we pass through pricing, you are going to have a natural compression in the Flavor Solutions business, which we have seen in the past as we pass through penny cost, as we said. COVID cost obviously hit us in the second quarter, although we were comparable to last year overall, but there was some segment mix there. We do feel too within the Flavor Solutions category though, we \u2013 one with FONA, that's a nice margin bump. But even within the product portfolio, we see some margin positive as we migrate the business. So, as we grow sales more and get that \u2013 get more leverage to the rest of the year, because we are lapping a pretty soft second six last year, we are hopeful that will improve, too. It's \u2013 you are right, we are lapping a third quarter \u2013 a strong third quarter last year, we had about 8% total growth at 9% constant currency. And the consumer business was stronger compared to flavor last year. So, from a segment mix perspective is a little bit of a headwind in the third quarter. And you are right, the lagging of pricing does help the fourth quarter. We are also, as I just mentioned, higher brand marking in the third. Because if you remember, last year, in the fourth quarter, we had \u2013 I think it was around a 20% A&P increase, which was continued in Q1 and Q2. So, it would be an easier fourth quarter comparison from an A&P perspective. And a little bit from the sales, of sales in the fourth quarter for the company. We are below that 9% constant currency I mentioned before. Yes, I think, too, I mean another testament to our broad-based differentiated portfolio. But if you add them to your question about our 4% to 6% constant currency long-term growth of which a third of that is M&A. So you bolt on M&A, you take that out. So, you are kind of highlighting a 2.5% to 4% is our long-term guidance. Last year, constant currency organic growth was 5%. This year, the midpoint of our guidance is around 5%, too. So, we are seeing \u2013 I think Lawrence, the acceleration of those trends is reinforcing our belief on that organic growth of our long-term guidance. Yes. Really, in the second quarter, it was mainly segment mix as we said. I mean the costs have been rising, but we have taken some pricing \u2013 but it's really around segment mix in Q2. It changed a little bit in the second six, as we have guided gross margin probably between 90 basis point and 120 basis points if you do the squeeze on the gross margin, two-thirds of that is really \u2013 you are raising sales due to some pricing offsetting inflation and the FX piece, it's not dropped through the profits. So, that's about two-thirds of that compression. The other third is some of the lag in the pricing, costs are coming through in the third quarter. We got pricing a little later. So, it's a little bit of that, but it's basically two-thirds due to mass and a third due to kind of the timing of the price. Yes. We don't \u2013 I mean you will see in the Q coming out today, capital hasn't changed from last quarter. What was the question so we don't give interest guidance."

To accompany this call, we posted set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our remarks, we will begin a question-and-answer session.  We will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information and constant currency, as well as adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and innovation expenses related to the acquisition of Cholula and FONA.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on slide four, our first quarter results were outstanding. As we said in our year-end earnings call in January, we have confidence in our strategies and are well-positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021. Following an extraordinary in 2020, in 2021 we expect strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales growth, as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and business transformation investments highlighting our focus on profit realization. During the first quarter, we delivered double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth. We expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021, given 2020 level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we have started the year with outstanding first quarter performance giving us confidence in an even stronger outlook for 2021. As seen on slide five, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance as evidenced again by our first quarter results. The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at-home continued to drive substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand in all regions, as well as increases in our packaged food company customer in our Flavor Solutions segment.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. Starting with our topline growth, as seen on slide 18, we grew sales 20% in constant currency during the first quarter, our volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributed to the increase. Our organic sales growth was 16%, driven by our Consumer segment and incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. The Consumer segment sales grew 32% in constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions. The sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our Consumer products, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives, and resulted in higher volume and mix in each region. On slide 19, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased to 30% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2020, with 5% of the increase from the acquisition of Cholula. The remaining increase from higher volume and product mix was broad-based across the majority of categories and brands, as well as private label products, with particular strength in the McCormick, Frank\u2019s RedHot, French\u2019s, Zatarain\u2019s, Lawry\u2019s, Simply Asia and Gourmet Garden brands. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales growth -- grew 26% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in all countries and categories across the region. The most significant volume and mixed growth drivers were Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, Vahin\u00e9 homemade dessert products, packaging products and our Kamis branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 55% in constant currency, driven primarily by the recovery from the disruption in China consumption last year, as Lawrence mentioned. Excluding that recovery impact, the region had double-digit growth due to strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially driven by the timing of Chinese New Year and related holiday promotions, as well as continued strength in Australia. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in slide 22, we grew first quarter constant currency sales 3%. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2%, driven by the FONA and Cholula acquisitions, a 7% increase, as well as pricing to offset of increase. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food company, with particular strength in snacks seasonings and savory flavors. In EMEA, constant currency sales were comparable to last year, as pricing actions offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies with strengthened snacks seasonings. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 18% at constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers limited time offers and promotional activities, as well as the China recovery impact from last year\u2019s COVID-19 related lockdown. As seen on slide 26, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges increased 35% or international currency 32% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. The Consumer segment adjusted operating income grew 59% to $190 million, a 54% constant currency growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19 related costs and a 17% increase in brand marketing. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 4% to $73 million with minimal impact from currency. Higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. As seen on slide 27, adjusted gross profit margin expanded 60 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period due to favorable mix, both within the Consumer segment and due to the sales shift between segments. In addition, CCI-led cost savings were partially offset by COVID-19 related costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of net sales, was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Leverage from sales growth drove the declined, partially offset by the increase in brand marketing, I mentioned a moment ago. With the growth -- gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points for the first quarter of 2020. Turning to income taxes on slide 28, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7%, compared to 18.4% in the year ago period. The first quarter adjusted tax rate in 2020 was significantly impacted by a favorable discrete item related to a refinement of our entity structure. Income from unconsolidated operations increased 28% in the first quarter of 2021, due to strong underlying performance of our joint venture in Mexico. At the bottomline, as shown on slide 30, first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.72, as compared to $0.54 for the year ago period. The increase was due to our higher adjusted operating income performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate. On slide 31, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an outflow of $32 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to an inflow of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. This change was primarily due to a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent trans -- acquisitions. In February, we raised $1 billion through the issuance of five-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We also return to $91 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and use $49 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of the cash, funding investments to fuel growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now, I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on slide 32 and 33. With our broad and advantage flavor portfolio, a robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well-positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting topline and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment, as well as our higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 2-percentage-point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. At the topline, due to our first quarter results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 6% to 8%, compared to 5% to 7% previously, which continues to include the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions at the projected range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth lines. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020\u2019s level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we continue to expect we will drive overall organic sales growth for the full year in both of our segments. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be comparable to 2020 due to increasing inflationary pressure, mainly due to transportation costs, but our inflation expectation for the full year remains a low single-digit increase. Our adjusted gross margin projections reflect margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix from segments and COVID-19 costs. Our estimate for COVID-19 costs remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021, as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2021 COVID-19 costs are largely from the third-party manufacturing costs. Reflecting the increase in our sales outlook, we are also increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 11% to 13% constant currency growth, compared to 10% to 12% previously. This is partially offset by a 1% impact from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% impact of the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 7% to 9% in constant currency, increased from 6% to 8% previously. This projection reflects the inflationary pressure I just mentioned, as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. We also continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long-term financing, which I mentioned earlier. Our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02, compared to $2.91 to $2.96 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 11% to 13% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwinds. Based on the expected timing of some expense items such as COVID-19 cost and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our first quarter performance was a strong start to the year and we are optimistic for the balance of the year. But we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020, we are also making investments to drive growth in 2021. In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. With earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I\u2019d like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more details, I\u2019d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 34. Our first quarter results with double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth were an outstanding start to the year and bolstered our confidence in a stronger 2021 outlook. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We are confident the sustainability of higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and we are well-positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends, as well as prepared for away-from-home consumption recovery. Cholula and FONA have both started the year with strong momentum and results, our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our plans has only strengthened over the last few months. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance, while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond. Now, let\u2019s turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Andrew.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi. I guess, first off, sounds like you are making as expected good progress on getting many of those suspended items in SKUs back on the shelf as your capacity comes on stream. It sounds like there\u2019s still some more to go as you move through the year, I guess, particularly in 2Q. Is there any way you can maybe dimensionalize that a bit and how significant that refill might be in 2Q, even if it\u2019s like versus the magnitude of what you saw in 1Q, just to try and put some context around it? And have you had any challenges in getting some of those suspended items back on the shelf at all, because I know that in Europe you mentioned you would actually benefited from incremental shelf placement at the expense of some competitors that had some capacity issues. I didn\u2019t know if the reverse had been an issue for you here? And then I am just going to follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Andrew, Well, as we have gone through the COVID crisis in 2020 and we want to ship consumption every quarter because we were not able to keep up with the extended elevated levels of demand overall. And in order to keep our best selling items, our core items and in particular as we got to the fall protect the holiday items, we did suspend a substantial number of items and as that capacity we have been steadily restoring them as we have gone through this first quarter of this year. And I\u2019d say that right now we probably are around the halfway point in terms of getting items back on the shelf. But any -- you or anyone on this call and certainly my friends and family who hector me about this endlessly, can walk into any store and find that there are a lot of holes on the shelf and a lot of our products that are not yet in full distribution and even within a given account, the store-by-store situation it might be different. There\u2019s a supply chain aspect to it. There\u2019s a retail work aspect to getting on the shelf. And I think that this is going to be a steady rebuild as we go through the rest of the year. We have made a good start on it in Q1, but we have quite a long way to go. And it\u2019s hard -- I would hesitate to get overly precise about it. I would expect to see the shelf getting restored as we go through the year. I think one of the big variables for us, Andrew, is just the strength of the consumer demand.\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah.\nLawrence Kurzius: Consumer demand has been higher than we originally planned and so we are actually not as far along in our restoration plans as we would have hoped. That\u2019s because as fast as we supply the market, consumers are pulling the product through. But as you think that, it\u2019s hard -- I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard for us to dimensionalize. I will emphasize\u2026\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah.\nLawrence Kurzius: \u2026 it\u2019s an America\u2019s problem. Most of the world, we are shipping to consumption, our supply chain is well caught up or our service levels are solid. It\u2019s in the Americas where we have got some catching up to do. And in most categories here in the Americas we are also shipping consumption as well. It\u2019s primarily herbs and spices, and our recipe mixes particularly.\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think you are going to see a big change in the TDPs as we go through the coming weeks and I think I am sure we hit bottom on that and already turn the quarter just because of the restoration efforts daily.\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah.\nMike Smith: I think just to add to that too, we are going to be a little bit more optimistic but prudent. I mean the second quarter of last year as you remember we grew total consumer sales 28%, 36% in the Americans. So it\u2019s a tough comp as we look forward but we are optimistic.\nAndrew Lazar: Yeah. Understood. And thank you for the TDP comment that leads into just a quick follow-up, which is, where do you -- what\u2019s your best guess at where TDPs might end up like once we get to a steady state, let\u2019s say, versus 2019. I am assuming they will be down a bit just as you have come through this and maybe in a more efficient shelf going forward even though I know they probably reached obviously more depth during the actual pandemic and manage to recover. But we do expect TDPs to be down maybe a couple of percent going forward\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. That is\u2026\nAndrew Lazar: \u2026 that sort of a steady state?\nLawrence Kurzius: \u2026very good observation. As we have gone through this we have not only suspended SKUs but we have also rationalized SKUs. We have eliminated a couple of hundred SKUs that were slow moving or what the items that we have now are much higher velocity on an average. We are also continuing the aisle reinvention program and setting store shelves. We -- in spite of that I think the COVID situation last year and all of the restrictions around working the shelf we were able to reset over 5,000 stores. We expect at least that many this year and a reduction we are getting a lift from that and at the same time it does reduce the SKU count. So it\u2019s a\u2026\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: \nAndrew Lazar: Right. Thank you very much everybody.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. You have a unique perspective because you see broadly across so many retail and foodservice categories. I am curious in the U.S. restaurant sales, we are doing better right? Americans are traveling much more? But at the same time, we are seeing overall food at-home take away really remaining strong and I think probably better than what some may have expected? Obviously down on a weekly basis, but still better on a two year? So I am just curious, are you surprised and how do you reconcile the improved foodservice sales that we are seeing across the entire industry, with what I would consider still impressive at-home trends? I never want to bet against the simplest explanation, which is that Americans are just eating more, but I think the total implied increase in food numbers. It\u2019s still -- it is notable. I am just curious for your thoughts there?\nLawrence Kurzius: Right. Hey, Ken. Thanks. And by the way you won the award for the best headline on your screen that was awesome.\nKen Goldman: All the short-term are mad at me for overstating it. So it works both ways.\nLawrence Kurzius: Okay. Well, I would say, first of all, the food at-home consumption really is strong. I mean we are seeing that ourselves and in our business of course and also in our Flavor Solutions business where the other CPG companies are our customers. And so we see growth -- we are seeing a lot of strength there. I think on restaurant it\u2019s actually a mixed bag. The QSR, the quick service restaurants are doing well. I think during the first quarter, there were a lot of -- because everyone thinks about the state we are in today, but think about December and January, there were a lot of new lockdowns that were put in place, the restrictions that were -- have been lifted or reinstated. I would say that the branded foodservice side, the restaurant customers might be off to a little bit slower start to the year and everyone maybe thinking. I do think there\u2019s a lot of optimism among restaurant operators as we go into the second quarter and as the vaccination rates go up and many of these restrictions are lift and I think that that group will come back stronger. But certainly for the beginning of the year they are off to a little bit slower start.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thank you. I know we are running a little long but I wanted to sneak one more in which is it\u2019s always dangerous to ask about math on earnings calls, but back of the envelope it seems you are implying now that for the last nine months of the year, right, 2Q to 4Q organic sales growth is actually going to be a little bit less than what you have anticipated a few months ago and I am just basing this on some of your guidance items? So is it fair to say that the first quarter over shipment was so strong that it may be pulled forward some of your expected shipments ahead or am I really parsing that info too finally and you are not really making any implied changes to guidance?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. So our intent was to reflect the sales growth over delivery that we got in the first quarter, but -- which was high. But we really did not change our outlook for the rest of the year\u2026\nMike Smith: Yeah. Year ago for the total constant organic as we call it is basically the same. It\u2019s plus or minus 1% for the year. So we call our base of the range is 2.5% to 4%, up 1%. But you are right, year ago it basically what we said before, we haven\u2019t called it down.\nKen Goldman: Okay.\nMike Smith: But I know and as you and others the two year CAGRs or what\u2019s really an impressive part as we start measuring this and looking at lapping things. Those are actually above our organic growth guidance long-term that we are seeing now.\nLawrence Kurzius: And it is just the\u2026\nKen Goldman: Got it.\nLawrence Kurzius: \u2026 first quarter, so we are trying to be both optimism -- express our optimism, because I mean the business is very strong, but also a bit prudent. I mean we are lapping a big second...\nMike Smith: We are lapping\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: We are lapping to second quarter there.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: All right. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Good morning. I don\u2019t think you are in the practice of giving us your COVID costs, but I was wondering if they now did need to be higher this year than expected, because you need to rely on third parties more than you thought and if you can maybe compare that to 2020? I am also wondering if I look at second quarter a different way. I know the year-over-year is difficult to look at. But sequentially, you typically have higher sales in 2Q than you have in 1Q and higher first -- and higher profit. But I think consensus is assuming that that won\u2019t happen. So I know you have given us first half, second half guidance, but wondering for a little more clarity on how 2Q compares to 1Q maybe sequentially? Thanks.\nMike Smith: Yeah. This is Mike. On the COVID cost, we said previously and we haven\u2019t changed from that, we spent about $50 million last year and we are going to ever spend about $60 million this year. So that\u2019s about spend.\nRobert Moskow: Okay.\nMike Smith: Now the timing of that is a little different. It\u2019s going to be first half heavily weighted in 2021, a lot of that\u2019s cumin cost we talked about before. Kind of leading in your second question, like, Colmin  was coming in the first quarter wasn\u2019t a full impact of the Colmin cost as we ramp things up, so really the second quarter is where kind of these every month will have the full Colmin cost, so that\u2019s a little bit of the headwind in the second quarter. We talked about the first quarter our consumer A&P was up around 17%, we are going to have another investment of A&P in the second quarter to drive sales as we said again as towards the first half, second half story. So I think Q2 has a bit of a headwind from an expense perspective and then COVID and A&P cost perspective. And also the tax rates, they are going down to the EPS line.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.\nMike Smith: I say maybe we summarize this, we talked about the year being a first half, second half story, within the first half, there\u2019s a first quarter and the second story -- the second quarter story, think of it that way.\nRobert Moskow: Yeah. And again first half EPS still up versus year ago.\nMike Smith: Yeah.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please share your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So you mentioned e-commerce briefly in the prepared remarks. Could you give us a little bit more color region-by-region? You talked about strong double-digit growth and I am just wondering how that varied in the various parts of the world? And are you seeing a slowdown in some of those areas at this point as reopening happened? And then I have a follow up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. Well, first of all, e-commerce is strong everywhere. We talked last year about triple-digit and at the end of the year, we said, e-commerce total was around, I think, it was 136% increase year-on-year. It\u2019s not quite triple-digit, but it\u2019s a very strong double-digit increase in the first quarter again on top of the strong performance last year. So, I mean, I\u2019d say, that that\u2019s still pretty explosive growth and we have no disappointment about that. I\u2019d say, the omnichannel, particularly is very strong and I don\u2019t -- I think that the -- while the numbers may be slightly different region-to-region, but they trend in the same direction globally.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think consumers have had a good experience shopping online.\nMike Smith: Well, I think that the habits that they are going to continue using to what we are seeing.\nLawrence Kurzius: Right.\nMike Smith: Some of our consumer research.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, in terms of new product, it sounds as though you have obviously got an impressive lineup to 2021. Is your percentage of sales from new products trending upwards, I imagine it was slower last year because of the pandemic. I don\u2019t know what you can quantify exactly what percentage of sales from new products you are anticipating this year and how that compares to maybe where you were a year ago?\nLawrence Kurzius: I will let Mike speak to the numbers of...\nMike Smith: I think it is more -- I think that as a more normal year. In a normal year, we are talking about 7% or 8% of our products introduced in the last three years make up our sales pace. It would have been less last year because of the pandemic, but it was kind of a strong ramp of new products in the 2021, as you have seen that we get back to more normal longer term numbers.\nAlexia Howard: Great.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yeah. A number of the items that we launched last year, we got less placement on it because of the focus on core items, not just by us but by the retailers. On the other hand, where we -- they did get into distribution. They have got an extraordinary amount of trial. So some of the items that we did launch last year are no longer best performing at new items and new aisles and we are really treating 2021 as a continuation of the launch here for NPD we introduced last year. So it gives us quite a pipeline for this year.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Adam.\nMike Smith: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. So I just want to clarify -- two clarification questions. First, the relative to the earnings call in January the expectations on raw materials and cost inflation were unchanged? And just to be clear just in terms of what you are seeing in terms of freight, packaging, varieties of raw material, ingredients, is that something where you have had enough contracted and not exposed to the spot market to insulate you for fiscal 2021 or is it just your aggregate commodity basket really hasn\u2019t moved that much because\u2026\nMike Smith: I mean it\u2026\nAdam Samuelson: \u2026more broadly seems...\nMike Smith: Yeah. This is Mike. I mean we haven\u2019t changed our guidance for the year still low-single digits, obviously, a lot of commodities and packaging to your point is already contracted. In freight variable that we have talked about and one of the reasons we said while we have had growing great growth in mix and things like that in the long-term debt optimization. We didn\u2019t drop it off through to the bottomline because some pressure from increased inflation from transportation just like every other company has been seeing recently and those we have recognized that in our forecasts and our guidance but we are still low single digits generally.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then the second clarification just you talked about over shipping Americas consumption growth of 15%. I am just trying to make sure in the slides the Americas volume price mix, our product mix is up 25%, 24.5%. Is that apples to apples versus the 15% or what the -- just trying to understand the magnitude of how much you were actually over shipping in the period?\nLawrence Kurzius: In a year ago -- this is Lawrence. In a year ago in the first quarter of last year it seems like a long -- life time ago in the Americas are actually under shift consumption in the first quarter a year ago and so at the time we said was about a 4% impact on the Americas. So I think you should factor that out and so the over shipment versus consumption might be a little bit less than it seems. Again, we\u2026\nAdam Samuelson: Okay.\nLawrence Kurzius: \u2026 are hopeful actually to build to rebuild stocks in the trade more than we did and the consumption is very strong.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That\u2019s all really helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. We are nearing the end of our question-and-answer session for today and have time for one additional question which is coming from line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning Chris.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just I will make a quick here. I know we are at the end of this, just real quickly. Just to understand as we think about those third-party co-manufacturing costs and a bit of weight on the gross margin, do those continue all through the year? Just understand like are you using third parties just to rebuild inventory and then you can shut that down or is this something that will be ongoing in terms of your supply of product in the future?\nMike Smith: Hey, Chris. It\u2019s Mike. One, we are always using food manufacturers. That\u2019s a part of our supply chain. As we talked about though here we really stretch some of those strategic co-factors to help us out shorter term really focused on the first six months of the year, very volume dependent. So, the way we are thinking now is again the second quarter will be the heaviest spend there will be some probably roles into third quarter or so but. And we will see what volume is too, what consumption continues as something we would assess as we always do. And as our supply chain continues to recover that\u2019s another variable that could speed it up or slow it down. So those are all considered in our guidance stuff.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick one on as I think about what\u2019s happening in China, you saw double-digit consumption in consumer sales and I think that even excludes the branded foodservice you sell -- the products you sell, as well as a really strong recovery in foodservice. I guess I just want to understand, make sure that those numbers are accurate and then to the degree to which that is somewhat of a predictor of what can happen in the U.S. as we saw the lap the tougher comps on the consumer side with the easy comps on the foodservice side, are you learning anything from what\u2019s happened in China as an indicator for the U.S.?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I think, the interesting thing in China is that, even though they are well past the COVID impact and are very far along in recovery, consumption of food at-home remains strong even as foodservice has recovered. The -- I think it\u2019s interesting to look around that region also because what we are talking about the Asia-Pacific region, it is not just China that\u2019s the biggest market there. But markets like Australia which is also pretty far along in recovery, even though foodservices has rebounded, it\u2019s not back to the same level that it once was and consumption of food at-home has continued to be very strong.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think it goes to the point that we have -- the making which is that, this has been a long-term trend anyway for consumers where they cook more at-home and more from scratch at home when they do and the COVID situation reinforced that behavior that helped whole new generation of cooks learn how to cook their family recipes that maybe they relied on mom or grandma, all new eating occasions as well as new\u2026\nMike Smith: Lunch\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: All new eating occasions like lunch as people work remotely. I think there are lot of reasons to believe that consumption at-home is going to continue to be elevated.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your questions and for participating in today\u2019s call. I apologize to those that we didn\u2019t get to in the queue. We did have a very long script today. We had a lot of information to get out. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and reach of our balanced portfolio which is sustainably positioned us for growth. We are very pleased with our outstanding first quarter operating performance, which proves the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company. We expect to drive even further growth as we continue to execute on a long-term growth performance and people strategies actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on new opportunities. Our investments provide a new foundation for growth, while enhancing our agility and our relevance with consumers and customers, which positions us well for continued success and long-term shareholder value creation.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thanks everybody for joining today\u2019s call. And again, we apologize to those that did not get. And I would be happy to follow up with you after the call. If there are any further questions from anybody regarding today\u2019s information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes this morning\u2019s conference call. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on slide four, our first quarter results were outstanding. As we said in our year-end earnings call in January, we have confidence in our strategies and are well-positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021. Following an extraordinary in 2020, in 2021 we expect strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales growth, as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and business transformation investments highlighting our focus on profit realization. During the first quarter, we delivered double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth. We expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021, given 2020 level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we have started the year with outstanding first quarter performance giving us confidence in an even stronger outlook for 2021. As seen on slide five, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance as evidenced again by our first quarter results. The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at-home continued to drive substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand in all regions, as well as increases in our packaged food company customer in our Flavor Solutions segment. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more details, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 34. Our first quarter results with double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth were an outstanding start to the year and bolstered our confidence in a stronger 2021 outlook. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We are confident the sustainability of higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and we are well-positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends, as well as prepared for away-from-home consumption recovery. Cholula and FONA have both started the year with strong momentum and results, our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our plans has only strengthened over the last few months. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance, while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond. Now, let's turn to your questions. Good morning, Andrew. Sure, Andrew, Well, as we have gone through the COVID crisis in 2020 and we want to ship consumption every quarter because we were not able to keep up with the extended elevated levels of demand overall. And in order to keep our best selling items, our core items and in particular as we got to the fall protect the holiday items, we did suspend a substantial number of items and as that capacity we have been steadily restoring them as we have gone through this first quarter of this year. And I'd say that right now we probably are around the halfway point in terms of getting items back on the shelf. But any -- you or anyone on this call and certainly my friends and family who hector me about this endlessly, can walk into any store and find that there are a lot of holes on the shelf and a lot of our products that are not yet in full distribution and even within a given account, the store-by-store situation it might be different. There's a supply chain aspect to it. There's a retail work aspect to getting on the shelf. And I think that this is going to be a steady rebuild as we go through the rest of the year. We have made a good start on it in Q1, but we have quite a long way to go. And it's hard -- I would hesitate to get overly precise about it. I would expect to see the shelf getting restored as we go through the year. I think one of the big variables for us, Andrew, is just the strength of the consumer demand. Consumer demand has been higher than we originally planned and so we are actually not as far along in our restoration plans as we would have hoped. That's because as fast as we supply the market, consumers are pulling the product through. But as you think that, it's hard -- I'd say it's hard for us to dimensionalize. I will emphasize... ... it's an America's problem. Most of the world, we are shipping to consumption, our supply chain is well caught up or our service levels are solid. It's in the Americas where we have got some catching up to do. And in most categories here in the Americas we are also shipping consumption as well. It's primarily herbs and spices, and our recipe mixes particularly. I think you are going to see a big change in the TDPs as we go through the coming weeks and I think I am sure we hit bottom on that and already turn the quarter just because of the restoration efforts daily. Yeah. That is... ...very good observation. As we have gone through this we have not only suspended SKUs but we have also rationalized SKUs. We have eliminated a couple of hundred SKUs that were slow moving or what the items that we have now are much higher velocity on an average. We are also continuing the aisle reinvention program and setting store shelves. We -- in spite of that I think the COVID situation last year and all of the restrictions around working the shelf we were able to reset over 5,000 stores. We expect at least that many this year and a reduction we are getting a lift from that and at the same time it does reduce the SKU count. So it's a... Andrew Lazar: Right. Thank you very much everybody. Right. Hey, Ken. Thanks. And by the way you won the award for the best headline on your screen that was awesome. Okay. Well, I would say, first of all, the food at-home consumption really is strong. I mean we are seeing that ourselves and in our business of course and also in our Flavor Solutions business where the other CPG companies are our customers. And so we see growth -- we are seeing a lot of strength there. I think on restaurant it's actually a mixed bag. The QSR, the quick service restaurants are doing well. I think during the first quarter, there were a lot of -- because everyone thinks about the state we are in today, but think about December and January, there were a lot of new lockdowns that were put in place, the restrictions that were -- have been lifted or reinstated. I would say that the branded foodservice side, the restaurant customers might be off to a little bit slower start to the year and everyone maybe thinking. I do think there's a lot of optimism among restaurant operators as we go into the second quarter and as the vaccination rates go up and many of these restrictions are lift and I think that that group will come back stronger. But certainly for the beginning of the year they are off to a little bit slower start. Yeah. So our intent was to reflect the sales growth over delivery that we got in the first quarter, but -- which was high. But we really did not change our outlook for the rest of the year... And it is just the... ... first quarter, so we are trying to be both optimism -- express our optimism, because I mean the business is very strong, but also a bit prudent. I mean we are lapping a big second... We are lapping to second quarter there. Hi, Rob. Good morning, Alexia. Sure. Well, first of all, e-commerce is strong everywhere. We talked last year about triple-digit and at the end of the year, we said, e-commerce total was around, I think, it was 136% increase year-on-year. It's not quite triple-digit, but it's a very strong double-digit increase in the first quarter again on top of the strong performance last year. So, I mean, I'd say, that that's still pretty explosive growth and we have no disappointment about that. I'd say, the omnichannel, particularly is very strong and I don't -- I think that the -- while the numbers may be slightly different region-to-region, but they trend in the same direction globally. I think consumers have had a good experience shopping online. Right. I will let Mike speak to the numbers of... Yeah. A number of the items that we launched last year, we got less placement on it because of the focus on core items, not just by us but by the retailers. On the other hand, where we -- they did get into distribution. They have got an extraordinary amount of trial. So some of the items that we did launch last year are no longer best performing at new items and new aisles and we are really treating 2021 as a continuation of the launch here for NPD we introduced last year. So it gives us quite a pipeline for this year. Hi, Adam. In a year ago -- this is Lawrence. In a year ago in the first quarter of last year it seems like a long -- life time ago in the Americas are actually under shift consumption in the first quarter a year ago and so at the time we said was about a 4% impact on the Americas. So I think you should factor that out and so the over shipment versus consumption might be a little bit less than it seems. Again, we... ... are hopeful actually to build to rebuild stocks in the trade more than we did and the consumption is very strong. Great. Thanks, Adam. Good morning Chris. Well, I think, the interesting thing in China is that, even though they are well past the COVID impact and are very far along in recovery, consumption of food at-home remains strong even as foodservice has recovered. The -- I think it's interesting to look around that region also because what we are talking about the Asia-Pacific region, it is not just China that's the biggest market there. But markets like Australia which is also pretty far along in recovery, even though foodservices has rebounded, it's not back to the same level that it once was and consumption of food at-home has continued to be very strong. I think it goes to the point that we have -- the making which is that, this has been a long-term trend anyway for consumers where they cook more at-home and more from scratch at home when they do and the COVID situation reinforced that behavior that helped whole new generation of cooks learn how to cook their family recipes that maybe they relied on mom or grandma, all new eating occasions as well as new... All new eating occasions like lunch as people work remotely. I think there are lot of reasons to believe that consumption at-home is going to continue to be elevated. I'd like to thank everyone for your questions and for participating in today's call. I apologize to those that we didn't get to in the queue. We did have a very long script today.

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. Starting with our topline growth, as seen on slide 18, we grew sales 20% in constant currency during the first quarter, our volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributed to the increase. Our organic sales growth was 16%, driven by our Consumer segment and incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. The Consumer segment sales grew 32% in constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions. The sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our Consumer products, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives, and resulted in higher volume and mix in each region. On slide 19, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased to 30% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2020, with 5% of the increase from the acquisition of Cholula. The remaining increase from higher volume and product mix was broad-based across the majority of categories and brands, as well as private label products, with particular strength in the McCormick, Frank's RedHot, French's, Zatarain's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Gourmet Garden brands. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales growth -- grew 26% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in all countries and categories across the region. The most significant volume and mixed growth drivers were Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, Vahine\u0301 homemade dessert products, packaging products and our Kamis branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 55% in constant currency, driven primarily by the recovery from the disruption in China consumption last year, as Lawrence mentioned. Excluding that recovery impact, the region had double-digit growth due to strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially driven by the timing of Chinese New Year and related holiday promotions, as well as continued strength in Australia. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in slide 22, we grew first quarter constant currency sales 3%. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2%, driven by the FONA and Cholula acquisitions, a 7% increase, as well as pricing to offset of increase. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food company, with particular strength in snacks seasonings and savory flavors. In EMEA, constant currency sales were comparable to last year, as pricing actions offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies with strengthened snacks seasonings. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 18% at constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers limited time offers and promotional activities, as well as the China recovery impact from last year's COVID-19 related lockdown. As seen on slide 26, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges increased 35% or international currency 32% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. The Consumer segment adjusted operating income grew 59% to $190 million, a 54% constant currency growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19 related costs and a 17% increase in brand marketing. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 4% to $73 million with minimal impact from currency. Higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. As seen on slide 27, adjusted gross profit margin expanded 60 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period due to favorable mix, both within the Consumer segment and due to the sales shift between segments. In addition, CCI-led cost savings were partially offset by COVID-19 related costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of net sales, was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Leverage from sales growth drove the declined, partially offset by the increase in brand marketing, I mentioned a moment ago. With the growth -- gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points for the first quarter of 2020. Turning to income taxes on slide 28, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7%, compared to 18.4% in the year ago period. The first quarter adjusted tax rate in 2020 was significantly impacted by a favorable discrete item related to a refinement of our entity structure. Income from unconsolidated operations increased 28% in the first quarter of 2021, due to strong underlying performance of our joint venture in Mexico. At the bottomline, as shown on slide 30, first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.72, as compared to $0.54 for the year ago period. The increase was due to our higher adjusted operating income performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate. On slide 31, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an outflow of $32 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to an inflow of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. This change was primarily due to a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent trans -- acquisitions. In February, we raised $1 billion through the issuance of five-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We also return to $91 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and use $49 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of the cash, funding investments to fuel growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now, I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on slide 32 and 33. With our broad and advantage flavor portfolio, a robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well-positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting topline and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment, as well as our higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 2-percentage-point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. At the topline, due to our first quarter results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 6% to 8%, compared to 5% to 7% previously, which continues to include the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions at the projected range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth lines. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we continue to expect we will drive overall organic sales growth for the full year in both of our segments. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be comparable to 2020 due to increasing inflationary pressure, mainly due to transportation costs, but our inflation expectation for the full year remains a low single-digit increase. Our adjusted gross margin projections reflect margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix from segments and COVID-19 costs. Our estimate for COVID-19 costs remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021, as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2021 COVID-19 costs are largely from the third-party manufacturing costs. Reflecting the increase in our sales outlook, we are also increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 11% to 13% constant currency growth, compared to 10% to 12% previously. This is partially offset by a 1% impact from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% impact of the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 7% to 9% in constant currency, increased from 6% to 8% previously. This projection reflects the inflationary pressure I just mentioned, as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. We also continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long-term financing, which I mentioned earlier. Our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02, compared to $2.91 to $2.96 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 11% to 13% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwinds. Based on the expected timing of some expense items such as COVID-19 cost and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our first quarter performance was a strong start to the year and we are optimistic for the balance of the year. But we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020, we are also making investments to drive growth in 2021. In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. With earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions. Good morning. I think just to add to that too, we are going to be a little bit more optimistic but prudent. I mean the second quarter of last year as you remember we grew total consumer sales 28%, 36% in the Americans. So it's a tough comp as we look forward but we are optimistic. Yeah. Year ago for the total constant organic as we call it is basically the same. It's plus or minus 1% for the year. So we call our base of the range is 2.5% to 4%, up 1%. But you are right, year ago it basically what we said before, we haven't called it down. But I know and as you and others the two year CAGRs or what's really an impressive part as we start measuring this and looking at lapping things. Those are actually above our organic growth guidance long-term that we are seeing now. We are lapping... Yeah. This is Mike. On the COVID cost, we said previously and we haven't changed from that, we spent about $50 million last year and we are going to ever spend about $60 million this year. So that's about spend. Now the timing of that is a little different. It's going to be first half heavily weighted in 2021, a lot of that's cumin cost we talked about before. Kind of leading in your second question, like, Colmin  was coming in the first quarter wasn't a full impact of the Colmin cost as we ramp things up, so really the second quarter is where kind of these every month will have the full Colmin cost, so that's a little bit of the headwind in the second quarter. We talked about the first quarter our consumer A&P was up around 17%, we are going to have another investment of A&P in the second quarter to drive sales as we said again as towards the first half, second half story. So I think Q2 has a bit of a headwind from an expense perspective and then COVID and A&P cost perspective. And also the tax rates, they are going down to the EPS line. I say maybe we summarize this, we talked about the year being a first half, second half story, within the first half, there's a first quarter and the second story -- the second quarter story, think of it that way. Yeah. Well, I think that the habits that they are going to continue using to what we are seeing. Some of our consumer research. I think it is more -- I think that as a more normal year. In a normal year, we are talking about 7% or 8% of our products introduced in the last three years make up our sales pace. It would have been less last year because of the pandemic, but it was kind of a strong ramp of new products in the 2021, as you have seen that we get back to more normal longer term numbers. Good morning, Adam. I mean it... Yeah. This is Mike. I mean we haven't changed our guidance for the year still low-single digits, obviously, a lot of commodities and packaging to your point is already contracted. In freight variable that we have talked about and one of the reasons we said while we have had growing great growth in mix and things like that in the long-term debt optimization. We didn't drop it off through to the bottomline because some pressure from increased inflation from transportation just like every other company has been seeing recently and those we have recognized that in our forecasts and our guidance but we are still low single digits generally. Hey, Chris. It's Mike. One, we are always using food manufacturers. That's a part of our supply chain. As we talked about though here we really stretch some of those strategic co-factors to help us out shorter term really focused on the first six months of the year, very volume dependent. So, the way we are thinking now is again the second quarter will be the heaviest spend there will be some probably roles into third quarter or so but. And we will see what volume is too, what consumption continues as something we would assess as we always do. And as our supply chain continues to recover that's another variable that could speed it up or slow it down. So those are all considered in our guidance stuff. Lunch..."

Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter concluded a challenging and volatile year that impacted our ability to deliver on our expectations and our financial performance. At the same time, we ended the year with positive momentum with consumer consumption trends and flavor solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure. While more work remains to be done, our confidence in our outlook for 2023 and beyond is strong. Our organization is focused squarely on executing on the priorities I just mentioned. All of which are important drivers in the successful execution of our strategies and the delivery of stronger results. Turning to Slide 5, at our fourth quarter results, our sales declined 2% from the year ago period, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2% within our implied fourth quarter guidance range, but below our expectations. Greater-than-expected COVID-related disruptions in China unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both total McCormick and the Consumer segment by approximately 2%. Fourth quarter sales would have grown in the range of 4% in constant currency, excluding the impact of China on our results. We had anticipated even higher growth with fourth quarter restocking comparisons in the Americas Consumer segment further tempered our growth. As compared to last year, our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 2% reflected a 9% contribution from pricing actions partially offset by a 4% decline in underlying volume and product mix, an expected 2% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia and a 1% year-over-year volume decline from the China COVID-related disruption. Despite tempered fourth quarter sales performance, our underlying sales strength positions us well to accelerate sales growth in 2023. In our Consumer segment, excluding China, consumption trends strengthened, particularly in the U.S., where our fourth quarter total branded consumption grew 6%. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding, continued momentum across all regions. Consumers increasing demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers\u2019 product is those reflected in this performance and in our most recent proprietary consumer insights research. Our alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating and valuing trusted brands continues to deliver results. This alignment, combined with our broad and advantaged portfolio, plus the fundamental strength of our category continues to underscore McCormick\u2019s positioning for long-term differentiated growth in flavor. Moving to profit, our adjusted operating income decline of 10% or 9% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share decline of 13% fell short of our expectations. Let me spend a moment on the differences to our expectation. Unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our Consumer segment. This was primarily due to lower U.S. bites and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparison in both 2021 and 2022, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results also reflected lower-than-anticipated sales in China and an unfavorable product mix related to the sales mix between segments. In addition, with two COVID-related plant shutdowns in China, we realized lower operating leverage. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress to lower our run-rate cost in flavor solutions with the reduction of elevated costs that we have been incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business. The impact of that progress was offset in the fourth quarter by unexpected discrete one-time issues. However, we expect to see positive benefits in our results going forward. Turning to Slide 7, we are committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. In our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies while also strengthening our ability to service customers. To that end, we have targeted the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs over the next 2 years. We are also now taking streamlining actions across our entire organization targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings. The combination of these actions, which is our global operating effectiveness program, is incremental to our comprehensive continuous improvement or CCI savings. Our CCI program has a well-established track record of success and we are leveraging its proven program discipline to drive results. We expect our global operating effectiveness program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize $75 million through the P&L in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. We can see the results coming through and we expect the impact to scale up as the year progresses. Now, let me share more details on our actions. During last year, we transitioned to our global operating model allowing us to more effectively leverage our scale and drive cost reductions. As we further advance that model and streamline our processes, strengthen our collaboration and align our structure to work more efficiently, we are taking corresponding actions to streamline our workforce across the entire organization. We are making considerable progress on the streamlining actions we have underway. A large component of our streamlining actions is a U.S. voluntary retirement program, which is very far along with a targeted separation date of February 1. This will be followed by other actions, some of which will be involuntary. As always, we will care for employees in keeping with our shared value. Moving to the supply chain. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. And while we expect continued volatility in global supply chain, we have strengthened our resiliency over the past few years to achieve this priority. As we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we incurred additional costs above inflation, service our customers and have seen inefficiencies to develop in our supply chain. Some of these costs for investments and decisions made to support continued growth for both our customers and McCormick and some are the result of a buildup that can occur in periods of disruption. In 2022, with the service levels of focus the normalization of our supply chain costs and inventory levels has taken longer than expected. As we stated on our third quarter call, during the fourth quarter, we began to implement initiatives to optimize our cost structure, increase our capacity and reduce inventory levels while strengthening our supply chain resiliency and ability to service our customers. Now for some details on these initiatives. First and foremost, while we continue to resolve some outliers, we have rebuilt and stabilized our service back to strong levels and at a high level of finished goods inventory on hand. Operating from this position enables us to maximize our performance, reduce our labor costs and pare back excessive use of co-packers within our operations. Starting with labor as we expect it to be the most significant driver of our cost reductions, during the fourth quarter, we reinstated more normal shift schedule with most locations now operating on a 24/5 pattern. This allows us to eliminate inefficient and unpopular difficult to staff shifts. Additionally, as we move away from the industry-wide labor issues seen during the pandemic, we have stabilized absenteeism and turnover rates in our workforce and returned to more standard staffing by line. During the quarter, we optimized our leadership structure throughout our facilities and upgraded the talented key roles. Simultaneously, we are increasing the capability levels of our team. We are also accelerating automation, bringing for individual pieces of equipment to a completely automated line for a high-volume packaging format. We expect through these initiatives to reduce 10% of our Americas supply chain workforce. And over the past 3 months, we have already achieved half of the planned reduction. Next, turning to our capacity. We are supporting future growth and enabling better customer service by investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in constrained areas. These investments also enable the repatriation of the production we scaled up at co-packers while continuing to meet the elevated demand. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our flavors volume, including seasonings and flavor encapsulation, has been growing at a mid single-digit rate for each of the past 3 years and demand remains strong. Our investments in additional seasoning capacity as well as spring dry capacity with the expansion of bonus footprint are on track to be online during the second quarter. Meanwhile, in our Consumer segment, we have been using co-packers for targeted high-demand packaging format such as some of our large value sized items. Now given the efficiencies gained and the investments already in flight, we have started to repatriate some of these formats. Overall, we are on track for co-pack spending in 2023 to be the lowest in the past 5 years. From an inventory perspective, we are executing on initiatives to return to historical safety stock levels which has been disrupted and raised by the supply chain issues of the last few years. We reduced both raw material and finished good inventory during the fourth quarter. While we are aware we have further progress to make, we are confident and encouraged by the results our initiatives are delivering so far. As we progress to a more normalized environment, we will realize additional benefits from these changes. For example, we expect to see reductions in expedited freight and less than truckload shipping costs and will streamline other transportation inefficiencies. With the recent opening of our new Maryland logistics center, we are able to eliminate expensive external warehouse costs before even fully realizing the inventory reduction, accelerating the expense savings. With more efficient manufacturing and lower inventory levels, we expect low material losses. We have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years. I am confident in our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain while prioritizing meeting our customers\u2019 needs. The impact of our actions is expected to normalize our supply chain cost, enhance our efficiency and ability to meet demand, reduce inventory levels and ultimately increase our profit realization as reflected in our 2023 outlook. Our global operating effectiveness program has considerable momentum and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you after our first quarter of 2023. Now moving to fourth quarter business updates for each of our segments. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 8, sales performance in the quarter was impacted by factors mentioned previously, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, exits of businesses and COVID-related disruptions in China as well as trade inventory dynamics between years. These factors as well as lapping high COVID-related demand early in the year also impacted the full year performance. Importantly, on a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at a 5% CAGR, driven by the Americas region, but we are ending the year with positive momentum in our consumption trend. Now for some regional highlights on sales and consumption. Starting with the Americas, during the fourth quarter of 2021 because we were restocking, shipments were higher than consumption and we are lapping that this quarter, which impacts our sales growth. As we entered the holiday season this year and having shifted fairly in line with consumption for the first three quarters of the year, customers did not need to replenish their inventory as much despite strong consumer consumption during the holiday season. We estimate our fourth quarter sales growth rate was unfavorably impacted 6% related to these restocking comparisons. We did not fully appreciate the level of fourth quarter restocking in 2021, especially of high-margin holiday herbs and spices and the resulting impact on our year-over-year growth and as such, had expected stronger sales growth this year. That said excluding this impact, our underlying volume performance in the fourth quarter was better than in the second and third quarters. We have confidence that as we move out of the first quarter, the holiday season fluctuations this year between consumption and inventory levels as well as retailer restocking resulting from pandemic-driven dynamics will have normalized and we have an increased level of confidence in our visibility. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption growth was 6% this quarter, as indicated by our IRI consumption data combined with unmeasured channel was the strongest of the year. Our investments in brand marketing and stronger holiday merchandising proved to be effective. And with the stabilization of supply disruptions, restoration of our service levels continued and our fourth quarter service level was the best of the year, just shy of our pre-pandemic standards. Our consumption dollar sales, unit and volume all accelerated sequentially and our total distribution points or TDPs have stabilized. In spices and seasoning, our fourth quarter performance was the strongest of the year. Consumers are responding to our value messaging, trading up to larger sizes and according to our consumer insights are learning to navigate the current environment. We are continuing to build distribution on the Lawry\u2019s everyday spice range we launched last quarter and early results are positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category as consumers are trading up to this line for private label. In recipe mixes, we gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter and with improved packaging supply, we also gained share in hot sauce and mustard during the quarter. Across the portfolio, our trends are continuing to strengthen in the first quarter of 2023. In EMEA, we ended the year with our strongest sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our effective pricing and new product growth accelerated versus the first three quarters with our fourth quarter price realization, the highest of the year and our volume decline, the lowest. Our strong consumption momentum continued and accelerated sequentially. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we gained share versus last year and 2019 in the UK and Eastern Europe herbs, spices and seasoning. Those gains were somewhat offset by softer performance in France. In the UK, we are driving the hot sauce category with Frank\u2019s RedHot continuing to gain share again in the quarter and for the full year versus last year as well as compared to 2019. Additionally, in the UK, we advanced our recipe mix leadership during 2022 to the number one share position. As we entered 2023, we are confident in our continued momentum in the EMEA region. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low margin business in India, which we will lap after the first quarter of 2023 as well as the COVID-related disruption in China. Reflected in our outlook, we are expecting continued disruption into the first quarter of 2023 with an expected recovery after the Chinese New Year. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives are driving positive momentum with more to come from 2023 and we look forward to sharing this and our growth plans at CAGNY in a few weeks. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9, sales growth reflected pricing actions as well as higher base volume growth in new products. Our sales performance has been outstanding all year, led by double-digit growth every quarter in the Americas and EMEA regions, resulting in 12% growth for the full year. On a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at an 8% CAGR with strong growth in all three regions. Now for some regional highlights. Our Americas fourth quarter sales growth was the strongest of the year. Growth in flavors, including snack seasonings and flavors for performance nutrition and health end market applications, as well as branded foodservice products drove our fourth quarter performance as well as our strong broad-based growth for the year. We continue to realize the benefits from the combined capabilities of FONA and McCormick with new products contributing approximately 30% more growth in Flavors in 2022 than last year. Demand continues to strengthen with branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers and we are also expanding distribution and gaining share in both spices and seasonings and hot sauce. In EMEA, our strong fourth quarter performance in all product categories capped an outstanding year of 17% growth, including significant volume growth of 9% as well as pricing. We are winning in all markets and channels. Growth remains strong across our customer base led by the momentum with our quick-service restaurant or QSR customers, partially driven by expanded distribution and their promotional activities. In APV, we are driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, realizing growth from strong performance of core menu item sweet flavor. We delivered solid growth in the APC region for the year despite the COVID-related disruptions in China. Across markets outside of China, we drove double-digit growth with contributions from both volume and pricing. Overall, Flavor Solutions demand has remained strong. And for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand, driving extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us and are encouraged by the results our collaboration is already beginning to yield. While our Flavor Solutions sales growth has been outstanding, we are not delivering profit growth in this segment. We are committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We are confident we will achieve margin recovery through three actions, effective price realization. Our price increases are only now catching up to the pace of inflation and we are beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing live last year. The successful execution of the global operating effectiveness program I just mentioned, in particular, we expect the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies and the investments in capacity to have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, continued focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our customer engagement approach and culinary inspired innovation are driving our outstanding flavor solution momentum. We look to sharing more about our growth plan and margin recovery at CAGNY in a few weeks. Now some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 10, global demand for Flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rise in global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, but the younger generation stealing them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers\u2019 products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the dynamic global environment. As we look ahead to 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals that drove our industry leading historical financial performance remains strong and we are confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2022 and the momentum they are driving in 2023. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 13, our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India and the customer business in Russia and a 1% impact from China consumption disruption related to COVID restrictions. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 4% with the divestiture of Kitchen Basics contributing 1% to the decline and the combined impact of exiting the businesses in India and Russia as well as the China consumption disruption, contributing 3% to the decline. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency. Pricing actions in the region were more than offset by a volume decline, including a 2% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as a 6% impact from lapping the restocking and retail inventory in the fourth quarter of last year and a higher level of retail inventories entering this year\u2019s holiday season. Additionally, returning to pre-pandemic promotional levels also tempered our sales comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 2%. Pricing actions across all markets were partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 22%, including a 23% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 14% primarily due to pricing actions with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth in all regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13%, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Higher sales of packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand for branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. In EMEA, we drove 16% constant currency sales growth, with 10% related to pricing actions and 6% behind the mix. EMEA\u2019s Flavor Solutions growth was broad-based across this portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and packaged food and beverage company customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, driven by strength in their core menu items. As seen on Slide 21, adjusted gross margin declined 410 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. I will spend a moment on the significant drivers, highlighting the ones that drove more compression than we had expected. First, approximately 60% of this decline or 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, product mix was unfavorable as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as well as compared to our expectations for the quarter. First, in our Consumer segment. As mentioned earlier, lower U.S. spices and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022, as well as lower sales of higher-margin products in China due to the COVID restrictions negatively impacted mix. Sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The impact of the unfavorable product mix was higher than we expected due to the shortfall in consumer sales from what we had anticipated driven by both lower U.S. and China sales. Now for the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins. In our Consumer segment, we experienced lower operating leverage because of the sales comparisons already discussed. The impact, though, was greater than expected due to the China COVID-related plant shutdowns. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we transition production to our new UK Peterborough manufacturing facility, we continue to incur dual running costs. We expect the unfavorable year-over-year impact of these costs to continue in the first quarter of 2023. And then for the balance of the year, expect them to be comparable to 2022. Additionally, we are still incurring elevated costs to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful short-term, we know these investments to support our customers during periods of disruption are the right approach to drive long-term growth. That said, we did make progress on reducing the level of these costs in the fourth quarter. However, the impact of that progress was offset by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates and some discrete issues we experienced in our Flavor Solutions operations during the quarter. While we recovered quickly from these issues, they still contributed significant unexpected costs to the quarter. Finally, partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI cost savings. And of note, our price increases continue to catch up with cost inflation during the quarter for both segments. This was in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance. In 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation or pricing has lagged over the last 2 years. Now moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administration expenses for SG&A declined from the fourth quarter of last year with lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A declined 270 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 9% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In constant currency, the Consumer segment\u2019s adjusted operating income declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 26%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 23, our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter 2021 as well as over our third quarter of this year, both driven by the higher rate environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with higher interest expense and a higher fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate also contributing to the decrease. On Slide 25, we\u2019ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $652 million, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $397 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $262 million for capital expenditures in 2022. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. In 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to 2022 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With improving our gross margin, through our plan to normalize our supply chain costs and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt and expect to de-lever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2024. Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook on Slide 26, our 2023 outlook reflects our positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by significantly higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be minimal impact from currency rates. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year\u2019s pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which we expect to be consistent with 2022 at low levels that we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year\u2019s impact of COVID-related disruptions in China. Although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022\u2019s level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year\u2019s second quarter. And finally, the continued pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. This adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and global operating effectiveness programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our global operating effectiveness program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. Based on the anticipated timing of certain items, we expect our adjusted operating profit growth to be pressured in the first quarter, accelerated in the second quarter and returned to normalized cadence of delivery for the remainder of the year. The impact of cost inflation will be weighted toward the first half of 2023, with peak inflation in the first quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we expect continued pressure to sales and profit from COVID-related disruptions in China and then the benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping last year\u2019s impact. Additionally, the exit of our consumer business in Russia will impact the first quarter. As a reminder, we began exiting it during the second quarter of last year. Finally, related to profit timing, while we expect a minimal impact from currency rates, we project an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and expected 3% unfavorable in the first quarter and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% and based on our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2020 earnings growth. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10%, a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the global operating effectiveness program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the incentive compensation rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. Our fourth quarter sales performance despite challenges from the COVID-related disruptions in China reflects the underlying strength of our global portfolio and the continued execution of our long-term strategies. With the stabilization of service and our supply chain in addition to positive momentum and consumption trends, we expect an acceleration in consumer segment sales dollars and volume in 2023 and continued strong flavor solutions performance as the strength of our portfolio is net with outstanding demand across our customer base. We have strong growth programs, and we look forward to sharing them at CAGNY. We are committed to increasing our profit realization. The actions we have underway to normalize our supply chain costs and increase our organizational effectiveness and efficiency are already yielding results. Our global operating effectiveness program is expected to deliver $125 million of cost savings. We expect the benefits of the program to scale up through each quarter of 2023 and continue to be accretive into 2024. While actively responding to the macroeconomic challenges we are facing, we continue to operate with the same discipline and commitment to execution as we have in any other operating environment. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in both 2023 and beyond. The compelling benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. Before turning to your questions, I want to reiterate my confidence and driving the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 outlook. And now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Hello. I guess the question I\u2019m getting, I think, most from investors this morning really has to do with the fiscal \u201823 operating profit guidance of 9% to 11%. I understand you\u2019ve got incremental cost savings that are set to offset the incentive comp rebuild and you have some of the China recovery built in as well. But I guess, in what\u2019s still clearly a dynamic operating environment, it still seems, I guess, aggressive to a bunch of folks we\u2019ve spoken to this morning, especially given it\u2019s expected to be a somewhat back-end loaded year from a profitability standpoint. So I was hoping, Lawrence maybe you could comment a bit on that and add some more color on the level of confidence around this. And then I\u2019ve just got a follow-up. Thank you.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. This almost comes off of my final comments on the prepared remarks. We really believe that this is balanced guidance. It is certainly not aggressive. We have a due degree of humility after last year and have a balanced outlook considering risk. And we have a high degree of confidence in this guidance, including the operating profit guidance. It\u2019s underscored by our strong consumer demand and the underlying demand from the consumer is quite strong coming out of fourth quarter is actually the strongest demand, consumer demand, that we\u2019ve seen. And we continue to have tremendous demand from our Flavor Solutions customer. We have very strong programs that we did not talk about on this call, particularly on herbs and spices and we will be sharing those growth programs at CAGNY. And so that is a foundation, underlying the performance on operating profit. We have very strong confidence in our ability to realize the cost savings that we described. These programs are being managed programmatically through the same team that manages our CCI program. And I believe that they are very much in our control and we\u2019re quite confident about them. And I think that they more than offset the build of incentive comp. And maybe what some of the people you\u2019re talking about haven\u2019t fully considered is that we expect to cover not only this year\u2019s cost inflation, but also recover all of the costs that we have lagged over the last 2 years our pricing actions early in the year. And as you know, pricing actions take time to sell in. So you would be correct in assuming that many of these conversations are either completed or well underway at this time.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And that\u2019s a good segue into my follow-up, which is with low to mid-teens inflation still to come and as you\u2019ve talked about likely further pricing actions still ahead, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense how that jives with the price gap issue that you\u2019ve talked about previously in your core spice and seasonings category and the fact that pricing decelerated sequentially in fiscal 4Q in consumer versus 3Q? And I thought it was supposed to build and maybe that was mix versus actual price? Thanks.\nLawrence Kurzius: I am going to say a couple of words about that and I\u2019m going to let Brendan follow me. First of all, on that pricing, I would not forget that the significant portion of it is going to be on the Flavor Solutions side of the business. It\u2019s sort of confident when those have come up and allowed us to make some moves there. And so that is certainly a big part of the pricing equation. Our inflation outlook is higher actually on the Flavor Solutions inputs than on consumer input for the year. And so the pricing is similarly skewed more towards the Flavor Solutions side of it. I\u2019m going to let Brendan talk about the price gaps and take it from here please.\nBrendan Foley: Yes, it\u2019s still \u2013 Andrew, just to build on and Lawrence has replied. I\u2019ll just jump back to maybe, I think one of the points you brought up regarding private label. We are seeing price gaps narrow right now. And we certainly saw that in the fourth quarter, even leading into the first quarter. And we started to see that trade down moderate honestly, through the quarter. So that\u2019s kind of an insight. And maybe that\u2019s also a reaction just sort of the macro inflationary factors have seem to moderate also out there in the economy overall. Consumers are looking for brands, but they are also looking for value. And so it\u2019s not necessarily the lowest price. Parts of our portfolio, we\u2019re seeing really start to drive a lot of growth just on large sizes as we see consumers kind of look for that value. We also \u2013 you should have called out, launched this Lawry\u2019s everyday line of spices and we are starting to continue to build distribution on this, but the early results are really good, in fact, maybe better than what we expected. We\u2019re seeing a lot of incremental category sales and profit coming from this line, those because consumers are trading up from private label. That\u2019s kind of the source of volume that we\u2019re seeing coming from this and it\u2019s bringing in new consumers into the McCormick portfolio. So we are \u2013 we like the results so far that this is providing. But that\u2019s certainly a good outcome, and it factors into how we think about next year. On pricing, just sort of comparing quarter-to-quarter, to your point, I think that\u2019s probably more a function of the fact that we\u2019ve been reinstating promotional activity that\u2019s been, I think, called out previously. We\u2019re also lapping last year\u2019s increases, which were higher on a relative basis. But also our volume is in the fourth quarter had an impact on that overall level of pricing, too. So we\u2019ve covered that with regard to the restocking comparison, and that\u2019s factored into that quarter-to-quarter view.\nAndrew Lazar: Okay, thanks so much and see you guys in Florida.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hey, Ken. Good morning.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard you correctly, and maybe you said this, maybe you didn\u2019t. But you said that sales growth will be driven primarily by pricing. Does this mean you expect volumes for the year in \u201823 to be positive? And I guess, along those lines, I think you mentioned that you expect elasticity to not necessarily worsen in \u201823 versus \u201822? I think if I heard you right, you said it will remain kind of at today\u2019s level, just curious why that is given that the consumer environment does seem to be eroding a small amount?\nLawrence Kurzius: Start with the last part of it, Ken. We\u2019ve seen some moderation of elasticity as we\u2019ve gone through the year. It looks like peak elasticity was around the time when gas prices were at $5 a gallon and above for most of the country and was really not so much a reaction to our price increase, but to the general level of inflation that consumers were experiencing and the high pressure on their wallet. So our outlook for 2023 seems that the similar environment carries forward and that we\u2019re seeing elasticity in that range. We\u2019ve also adjusted \u2013 we\u2019ve looked at \u2013 we\u2019ve seen where we\u2019ve had greater elasticity and where we\u2019ve got less elasticity, and we\u2019ve reflected that in our future pricing actions. So I think that we\u2019ve really been thoughtful around the question of elasticity. We do expect the consumer to be under pressure in 2023. I don\u2019t care whether you call it a recession or a soft landing. Consumers on the lower end of the income spectrum, not even \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the bottom, I\u2019m talking about the lower half. I\u2019m certainly going to have less money and are going to be careful with their budgets. We are reflecting that in our marketing programs already, and with some of the innovation that we\u2019ve launched. It\u2019s not all about buying the cheapest product that consumers are looking for value, and that\u2019s really come through clear on our proprietary research and value has many components. It is true that our sales growth is driven primarily by pricing in 2023. And at the total company level, we expect volumes to be pretty much flat. And so that would be an improvement in the trend line, but that\u2019s going to vary tremendously by region and a good bit of the overall volume growth is going to come from recovery in China following this we expect following this quarter where we have that tremendous COVID impact right now during Chinese New Year.\nKen Goldman: You guys missed anything there?\nMike Smith: No, I think.\nKen Goldman: Just a quick follow-up and thank you for that. On the restocking, you mentioned that perhaps you hadn\u2019t quite recognized at the time, how large the impact was the last couple of years, totally understandable given the volatility that everyone is going through. I\u2019m just curious if the company is doing anything to maybe slightly improve its ability to quantify those dynamics maybe in a more real-time way. So that going forward, there is just fewer surprises from year-end.\nLawrence Kurzius: That\u2019s a great question, Ken. I\u2019m going to pass that straight to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. Definitely, this environment, certainly volatile, made it tougher to read. But as we think about just moving forward, it\u2019s definitely going through, I think this period of time has allowed us to kind of refine how we look at your restocking and just the fluctuations particularly coming out of the season between consumption and shipments. This has allowed us, I think, to kind of refine our view. Overall, we definitely had a pretty disciplined approach to it is even prior to the pandemic, but I think this is refine how we look at it in the tools that we use, the analytics that we apply. So we have a lot of confidence going into this next year, particularly as we exit the first quarter that just the fluctuations that we typically would see during the holiday season between consumption and shipments. And then on top of that, this restocking comparison, things begin to normalize. I think is our view as we come out of Q1 providing just a little bit more stability in that read.\nMike Smith: Some of that is internal to me. Our supply chain is really operating at a much higher level now than it has an investment service perspective and stability. That\u2019s another thing that gives us better insight into our sales.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. I was hoping you could break down \u2013 I was hoping to break down your volume forecast by Consumer versus Flavor Solutions. Because I think one of the strange dynamics of 2022 is that at a time when consumers are trying to save money, volumes were weak in Consumer, but your bonds pretty strong in Flavor Solutions. So I am wondering how you think of \u201823 and is there a risk that because the consumer environment is so volatile that it might be very tough to determine what the trade down between like foodservice and retail might be?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I don\u2019t think that we are giving or providing a split between the growth rates on consumer and flavor solutions. And I will say that we would expect higher growth on flavor solutions in 2023. We have \u2013 if nothing else, a higher level of pricing expected in the Flavor Solutions segment, and that alone is going to drive a higher increase year-on-year. Flavor Solutions is a bit of a portfolio itself. It includes branded foodservice, where we believe that we have gained significant share in North America, in particular, in our branded foodservice business with the number of wins as we have gone through the year. We have had tremendous growth on flavors and flavor seasonings, for our flavor solutions customers in the area of snacks, performance nutrition. The health end market, we have had a very strong unit growth through the entire pandemic and continuing through \u201822, and we have seen no end of sight on that. We have been slightly capacity constraint in that area. And we have some significant new capacity that for longer term investments that are finally coming on line in the second quarter that opens up additional capacity for us that\u2019s both for flavor with some expansion that we have done. And at bona or spray drying capability, and in snack seasonings, where we have been in the process of converting one of our plants from some low-margin products, the ability to run a snack seasonings and that conversion is effectively coming online. We are in the trial stages right now, should be online in second quarter. So, a bit of a longish answer there, but I hope that covered it.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Can I ask a follow-up? You talked about the new plant that\u2019s opening in the UK and the double costs, I guess that are involved in it. Why is it taking so long to get past these double costs?\nMike Smith: Hey Rob, it\u2019s Mike. I will answer that. I mean I would say this, I mean we are taking \u2013 we have a very large actually footprint in one part of the UK and then the Petersburg plant, which we talked about is a massive facility. So, we are kind of doing this in a two-step process to make sure we service our customers properly. So, it\u2019s different than when you are just building new capacity like we have talked about, where you are kind of adding on to a plant. We are actually closing a plant in a very difficult environment to close plants for a lot of reasons, moving it to a brand-new facility. So, that does take more time. The good news is we are kind of almost out of that after the first quarter. You think about the incremental costs we have talked about is in the first quarter after it levels out. And as that production \u2013 the remaining production transfers over the rest of this year, \u201824 will be a really clean year. But when you are closing big plants and opening a big plant, they don\u2019t take one quarter, it will take about a year, if you think about it, that\u2019s what this one is taking around that much time.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi there. Can we focus in on the flavor solutions business? You gave us the three reasons why margins should improve this year. I am kind of curious about timing on that. How quickly will the pricing kick in and the elimination of the capacity expansion costs, just a little bit on the timing. Thank you. And I have a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. I mean I wasn\u2019t really being specific on the dual running costs when I was describing the improvement in flavor solutions. In terms of the pricing, I don\u2019t want to get overly specific on this because we are in customer conversations right now. And there is a certain amount of commercial tension in all of those conversations. But we fully expect, as I have said about pricing generally on the flavor solutions side of the business as well that we will recover all of the inflation that we are not only incurring into the New Year, but also the cumulative inflation that we collected \u2013 that we have experienced the last two. And I would say that our lag in getting that getting caught up is greater in flavor solutions than it has been on the consumer side. So, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s pretty meaningful and that\u2019s an important element. We would fully expect to have that work complete early in the year.\nMike Smith: I think the other point, too, Alexia, a couple of things. We talked about inflation being weighted to the front of the year. First quarter is the highest inflation that impacts labor solutions as well as consumer. The other thing is our global operating effectiveness program. I mean there has been a lot of positive activity. The reality though is the first quarter is going to have the least impact and it\u2019s going to ramp up really rapidly in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. So, the second quarter is going to be a big impact. The flavor solutions because a lot of the inefficiencies we have talked about over the last year have been in the supply chain area for flavor solutions. So, we do see more of that savings going to that segment, which will help.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then as a follow-up, the \u2013 I have to come back to it, but the share dynamics in the U.S. herbs and spices that we are seeing in the Nielsen data. It looks as though you are still losing market share. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s private label anymore. I presume it\u2019s smaller brands. When do you expect that to turn the corner? And what \u2013 can you give us any more color about what the dynamics are there? Thanks and I will pass it on.\nLawrence Kurzius: Alexia. I would love to answer that question, but I am going to let Brendan answer it.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks Lawrence. Alexia, I just \u2013 as we look at our business, I think just first, remarking on the fourth quarter. I think what we were really feeling pretty \u2013 feel pretty good about in terms of the momentum we have talked about before is that we have seen sequential improvement not only across the total McCormick portfolio and consumer in the U.S., but also in herbs and spices. Fourth quarter is probably our best quarter of the year. We saw sequential improvement on not only sales, but also unit and also volume as we went through the second quarter all the way to the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s pretty good momentum going into the next year. Having said that, though, certainly, we saw a stabilization of where our share is right now and expect to improve that over the course of \u201822. But we don\u2019t never really get into the habit of sort of projecting what share will be in the future. So, we are not going to do that on this call necessarily, but we do expect to have improved performance in \u201823. And I think related to what those plans will be, we will talk a lot more about that at CAGNY. And so I think there will be a lot of great opportunity to kind of go deeper on what those plans and opportunities look like.\nLawrence Kurzius: We actually would have loved to have done that on this call and Kasey has insisted that we see some higher power. I know your question, Alexia, was about U.S. herbal and spices specifically. But if I could just step back, if I look at the fourth quarter, we gained share in hot sauce. We have gained substantial share in mustard what we finally are back in full supply. We had our, I think our fifth consecutive quarter in a row of strong share growth in recipe mixes, which \u2013 and everyone forgets those, but their profitability is right there with herbs and spices. And then in many of our international markets, we had share gains in urban spices specifically. So, when you look at the full picture, we have got \u2013 generally, as it has been the case all along, where we have had good supply, we have had the ability to grow our market share. A lot of the share loss that you are seeing is due to TDP losses early in the year that are still being left. And I expect we have won some of those TDPs back and I expect us to continue to do so as we go through \u201823.\nAlexia Howard: Very helpful. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Good morning everyone.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. Hi. So, I wanted to maybe hone in a little bit on the kind of net operating income growth guidance and where you shake out for 2023, because I am just trying to square the thought relative to where profit was in 2020 and 2021. Especially \u201821, you are still at the high end of the guidance range, $80 million, $90 million lower than you were last year, which there shouldn\u2019t be an incentive comp kind of comparison issue in there and you talk about fully recovering pricing \u2013 cost inflation. Currency has been a little bit of a headwind. Divestitures kind of net sold a few things and volumes are lower. But I guess I am just trying to reconcile kind of where on an absolute dollar basis, we shake out for 2023, inclusive of the incremental restructuring and the cumulative effect of pricing relative to where the profit dollars were 2 years ago, or 3 years ago and how we should think about that at the company level moving forward? I mean if we rebase somewhat through as we come through COVID, or is there an acceleration beyond 2024 and 2023 in profit growth to kind of get the long-term kind of EBIT CAGR back into that kind of mid to high-single digit range?\nMike Smith: Adam, this is Mike. Good question. I mean we put together the slide in the earnings deck to really walk you from the current guidance. And from a percentage basis, realizing it\u2019s not dollars, but from a percentage basis, constant currency guidance to the underlying base growth. And if you think about it, you look at that underlying base for, once you take out all the kind of I hate to say one-timers, but things are really discrete items year-over-year, and some of which will continue into next year, like the global operating effectiveness program, as you talked about rebuilding there are profit getting back to our long-term profit algorithm by taking out these costs that have really come through during the pandemic. So, I think there is a case for acceleration into the future. We are not talking about \u201824 or \u201825 right now. We need to nail \u201823. But if you look at that underlying base growth 4% to 6% net sales growth, which actually went out bolt-on M&A is at the high end of our guidance. So, really good underlying performance. We get back to the 7% to 9% operating profit growth. If you really if you think about the recovery of the pricing that we talked about, that allows us to really drive that 3 percentage point increase will get to that 7% to 9%. So, we feel good about that, along with our noble things like our normal CCI program and things like that, investing a bit more in advertising to grow the brand. So, that virtuous cycle we talk about is to get the operating profit and 1% leverage below there, we would love to pay down more debt. That\u2019s why we are driving hard on our working capital programs this year to get our inventories back down to where they need to be. So, we feel good about like Lawrence said before, it\u2019s a prudent call. We feel really confident about it. And so I think hopefully that helps you understand the moving parts other than the discrete items, some of which the positives will continue into next year, even the net recovery in China, hopefully \u201824 is better than the \u201823. But we feel good about on base.\nLawrence Kurzius: I will add to that, that the guidance that we are giving is balanced and all we have been saying prudent. And just from \u2013 that\u2019s our opinion. And as you have heard from some of the other questions, that there is somebody think that this actually might even be aggressive. But we have tried to give a balanced guidance here, but our teams are used to winning and have \u2013 we have very aggressive business plans, and we will do everything we can to not just recover, but exceed. We are used to starting every year-end earnings call with record \u2013 with the phrase record results. We were not able to do that this year, and we would like to get back on track with that low record of historic performance.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate all that color. If I can just ask a follow-up on flavor solutions and just \u2013 I mean there is a meaningful portion of that business that\u2019s selling into other food companies. And just want to get a sense if you saw or have experience or worried about any destocking amongst some of your food company customers who either have taken similar working capital kind of reduction actions as you are taking yourselves, or are kind of have counseled you to think about that potential moving forward in the context of a still fairly sluggish underlying consumption environment?\nLawrence Kurzius: I would say at this point, no. The fact is that our supply chain recovery, I believe and the feedback we get from our customers is generally ahead of the peers. And so many of them are still fairly hand to mouth right now and have a different set of dynamics. Many of them are still rebuilding inventory \u2013 sorry, rebuilding inventories in the store at the shelf and correctly getting items reinstated. And those in the area of snacking are just experiencing explosive growth.\nBrendan Foley: If I could build on that, Lawrence. Adam, the other thing to consider regarding our flavor solutions business is a good part of that sales growth algorithm is a lot of new product and innovation activity for our customers as well as winning new customers and winning share in the market. And so that factors into how we think about our growth.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. Alright. That\u2019s all helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I had a question coming back to kind of the U.S. business overall, and Brendan had talked about kind of moderating and trade down in the U.S. I wanted to understand, do you attribute that to your promotional spending? Was that one of the factors that helped drive that? And would you expect promotional spending to be up in fiscal \u201823, because I am trying to square that with the need for more pricing. And can you accomplish the price points you need and also see kind of the value it seems like consumers are seeking here?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. I will say that the promotional activity isn\u2019t all about discounting. And so a lot of the promotional activity that we have been able to reinstate is around merchandising activity, which includes displays and digital partnerships and all \u2013 and these things have very good ROI, and we are quite positive about it. I am going to give the floor here to Brendan though.\nBrendan Foley: Yes. I mean Chris, I think as we go into \u201823 and how we look at it, just to build off of where Lawrence is going, a lot of that promotional spending is getting back into driving the categories with our customers. And the feedback we are getting from them is welcome, frankly, in that regard because we want to keep driving up better overall growth. Can you just remind me the front end of your question, though, was in regards to what?\nChris Growe: Just that there is \u2013 you have seen a moderating and trade down and you have had an increase in promotional spending. So, I was trying to understand, is that driving that moderating and trade down? And then can you accomplish that if you are trying to get prices higher?\nBrendan Foley: I think you are seeing a confluence of a number of things happening in the quarter where some of those macro factors that we may have spoken about before, like the price of gas, etcetera, those seem to have moderated. So therefore, broadly, we think that has an impact. So, also the reinstatement of promotions probably during, obviously, a very important season like the holiday would have also a year-over-year impact there, too. But I think there is a couple of things we would like to add is we got more aggressive in Q4 for a reason. We called that out in the third quarter. And part of that includes also a lot of focus and an increased A&P around value messaging. And we have seen a lot of great response from that. And so I think there is a number of things playing in here, Chris, that lead us to believe that we have got good momentum going into \u201823.\nLawrence Kurzius: I will also say that our proprietary consumer survey shows that between May and December, when we have talked with \u2013 we ask consumers about their mechanisms for coping with higher pricing. Trading down to private label and store brands was the item that had the biggest decline in terms of the consumers who certainly were doing that. And so I think that matches up well with what we are seeing through the scanner and our other data.\nChris Growe: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for all of that color there. Just one other quick follow-on or question will be that inventory was kind of a moving factor year-over-year and you had a big increase last year in inventory. Did you build less inventory, I guess overall or should I say that maybe better that did inventory move lower in the fourth quarter than you expected? Is that the unique factor around the inventory move in the quarter?\nMike Smith: We did start making progress on our inventory in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned both in the raw material and finished goods side, which was really a focus with our global operating excellence for efficiency program. One of the outputs of that is reduced inventory too as you stabilize your supply chain. And we have very aggressive targets for this year. And again, it goes back to creating more cash to help drive our debt down.\nChris Growe: How about at retail?\nMike Smith: Progress is just starting.\nChris Growe: How about at retail as well, did retail inventories move lower in the fourth quarter?\nLawrence Kurzius: No, Chris. I would say that\u2019s not really the relationship we are trying to describe here. We feel like inventories simply retailers had done a lot of restocking in the fourth quarter just 1.1 [ph]. And they just happen to have more on hand as we are going to the holiday season. But I don\u2019t believe we are trying to say that they are executing the holiday season differently than they have as normal.\nMike Smith: Yes. And just in the normal ebb and flow of things. Remember, our fiscal year end stands in the middle of the holiday season. So, coming in the first quarter, retailer inventories are always high. We always ship below consumption in the first quarter. That\u2019s like a normal seasonal pattern. And I think that we are well set up for that. Just given the rapid amount of change, we are just being cautious about that. And in our remarks, we have said we expect normalization after Q1.\nChris Growe: That makes sense. Thanks so much for that color.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hi. Thanks for the question.\nLawrence Kurzius: Max, you\u2019re welcome.\nMax Gumport: On the call, you gave some helpful details on the puts and takes to consider with regard to the cadence of your EPS in FY \u201823. If I have it right, it sounds like the first quarter will be pressured as a result of peak inflation, cost savings ramping up throughout the year, a continued impact from COVID-related disruptions in China and a higher tax rate among other impacts. Can you help give us a sense for how dramatically these factors could hold back your first quarter EPS?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean I think on top of that, the highest commodity cost increases in the first quarter. I think the first quarter is always our smallest quarter. If you think about the cadence of, Max, in our history, fourth quarter are the most sales and most profit comes through because of the holiday season. Except for China, which is actually inversed. China\u2019s first quarter is their biggest quarter because of the Chinese New Year. So, that\u2019s another factor that\u2019s going to put pressure on our first quarter this year because of the COVID issues. But I would hesitate to say we get round number is what it\u2019s going to be, but it\u2019s going to be a difficult first quarter. For all the factors, you named four or five of the factors right on our list. I added the China impact also into that. So, as well as FX. FX is flat for the year, Max, but in the first quarter, it\u2019s about a 3% negative year-on-year. So, that\u2019s another reason that the first quarter is going to be the most challenging, but for all the reasons you mentioned with the global operating effectiveness, the recoveries and it will be strong for the rest of the year.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much. I will leave it there.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I will keep it pretty quick. I guess just as I think about the operating income bridge, the incentive comp piece of that, that\u2019s kind of an 800 basis point headwind as you rebuild that function. Like how flexible is that, or how discretionary is that? And the reason for the question is, let\u2019s say, if something in the plan that you have, the year goes wrong outside of your factors, right, China take longer to reopen or destocking take longer or restock gets stronger in the U.S. Like can you pull that piece of the puzzle back more as a means to kind of still hit the operating income target, or is that pretty much you have to \u2013 you are committed to spending that at this point?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, Peter, our incentive comp pays for growth. And we fell short of growth in 2022. And so that\u2019s reflected in a very low incentive comp that we didn\u2019t take back and confidence to the P&L. As we went through 2022, in 2023, it starts a New Year. And so we are starting with the expectation that we are going to hit our goals. And of course, as we over or under achieve, we will adjust incentive comp as we go through the year.\nMike Smith: Yes, it\u2019s very formulaic. The majority of our incentive competence based on McCormick profit, which is basically our operating profit less a capital charge we call kind of light EVA model to make sure all of us are held accountable for capital improvement. So, it\u2019s really focused a lot on operating profit and a bit on EPS, too, very formulaic. We pay for growth.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thank you. McCormick is aligned with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We are disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We are continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Laurence and thank you to everybody for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any questions regarding the information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes the call for today.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter concluded a challenging and volatile year that impacted our ability to deliver on our expectations and our financial performance. At the same time, we ended the year with positive momentum with consumer consumption trends and flavor solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure. While more work remains to be done, our confidence in our outlook for 2023 and beyond is strong. Our organization is focused squarely on executing on the priorities I just mentioned. All of which are important drivers in the successful execution of our strategies and the delivery of stronger results. Turning to Slide 5, at our fourth quarter results, our sales declined 2% from the year ago period, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2% within our implied fourth quarter guidance range, but below our expectations. Greater-than-expected COVID-related disruptions in China unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both total McCormick and the Consumer segment by approximately 2%. Fourth quarter sales would have grown in the range of 4% in constant currency, excluding the impact of China on our results. We had anticipated even higher growth with fourth quarter restocking comparisons in the Americas Consumer segment further tempered our growth. As compared to last year, our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 2% reflected a 9% contribution from pricing actions partially offset by a 4% decline in underlying volume and product mix, an expected 2% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia and a 1% year-over-year volume decline from the China COVID-related disruption. Despite tempered fourth quarter sales performance, our underlying sales strength positions us well to accelerate sales growth in 2023. In our Consumer segment, excluding China, consumption trends strengthened, particularly in the U.S., where our fourth quarter total branded consumption grew 6%. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding, continued momentum across all regions. Consumers increasing demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers' product is those reflected in this performance and in our most recent proprietary consumer insights research. Our alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating and valuing trusted brands continues to deliver results. This alignment, combined with our broad and advantaged portfolio, plus the fundamental strength of our category continues to underscore McCormick's positioning for long-term differentiated growth in flavor. Moving to profit, our adjusted operating income decline of 10% or 9% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share decline of 13% fell short of our expectations. Let me spend a moment on the differences to our expectation. Unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our Consumer segment. This was primarily due to lower U.S. bites and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparison in both 2021 and 2022, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results also reflected lower-than-anticipated sales in China and an unfavorable product mix related to the sales mix between segments. In addition, with two COVID-related plant shutdowns in China, we realized lower operating leverage. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress to lower our run-rate cost in flavor solutions with the reduction of elevated costs that we have been incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business. The impact of that progress was offset in the fourth quarter by unexpected discrete one-time issues. However, we expect to see positive benefits in our results going forward. Turning to Slide 7, we are committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. In our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies while also strengthening our ability to service customers. To that end, we have targeted the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs over the next 2 years. We are also now taking streamlining actions across our entire organization targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings. The combination of these actions, which is our global operating effectiveness program, is incremental to our comprehensive continuous improvement or CCI savings. Our CCI program has a well-established track record of success and we are leveraging its proven program discipline to drive results. We expect our global operating effectiveness program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize $75 million through the P&L in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. We can see the results coming through and we expect the impact to scale up as the year progresses. Now, let me share more details on our actions. During last year, we transitioned to our global operating model allowing us to more effectively leverage our scale and drive cost reductions. As we further advance that model and streamline our processes, strengthen our collaboration and align our structure to work more efficiently, we are taking corresponding actions to streamline our workforce across the entire organization. We are making considerable progress on the streamlining actions we have underway. A large component of our streamlining actions is a U.S. voluntary retirement program, which is very far along with a targeted separation date of February 1. This will be followed by other actions, some of which will be involuntary. As always, we will care for employees in keeping with our shared value. Moving to the supply chain. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. And while we expect continued volatility in global supply chain, we have strengthened our resiliency over the past few years to achieve this priority. As we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we incurred additional costs above inflation, service our customers and have seen inefficiencies to develop in our supply chain. Some of these costs for investments and decisions made to support continued growth for both our customers and McCormick and some are the result of a buildup that can occur in periods of disruption. In 2022, with the service levels of focus the normalization of our supply chain costs and inventory levels has taken longer than expected. As we stated on our third quarter call, during the fourth quarter, we began to implement initiatives to optimize our cost structure, increase our capacity and reduce inventory levels while strengthening our supply chain resiliency and ability to service our customers. Now for some details on these initiatives. First and foremost, while we continue to resolve some outliers, we have rebuilt and stabilized our service back to strong levels and at a high level of finished goods inventory on hand. Operating from this position enables us to maximize our performance, reduce our labor costs and pare back excessive use of co-packers within our operations. Starting with labor as we expect it to be the most significant driver of our cost reductions, during the fourth quarter, we reinstated more normal shift schedule with most locations now operating on a 24/5 pattern. This allows us to eliminate inefficient and unpopular difficult to staff shifts. Additionally, as we move away from the industry-wide labor issues seen during the pandemic, we have stabilized absenteeism and turnover rates in our workforce and returned to more standard staffing by line. During the quarter, we optimized our leadership structure throughout our facilities and upgraded the talented key roles. Simultaneously, we are increasing the capability levels of our team. We are also accelerating automation, bringing for individual pieces of equipment to a completely automated line for a high-volume packaging format. We expect through these initiatives to reduce 10% of our Americas supply chain workforce. And over the past 3 months, we have already achieved half of the planned reduction. Next, turning to our capacity. We are supporting future growth and enabling better customer service by investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in constrained areas. These investments also enable the repatriation of the production we scaled up at co-packers while continuing to meet the elevated demand. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our flavors volume, including seasonings and flavor encapsulation, has been growing at a mid single-digit rate for each of the past 3 years and demand remains strong. Our investments in additional seasoning capacity as well as spring dry capacity with the expansion of bonus footprint are on track to be online during the second quarter. Meanwhile, in our Consumer segment, we have been using co-packers for targeted high-demand packaging format such as some of our large value sized items. Now given the efficiencies gained and the investments already in flight, we have started to repatriate some of these formats. Overall, we are on track for co-pack spending in 2023 to be the lowest in the past 5 years. From an inventory perspective, we are executing on initiatives to return to historical safety stock levels which has been disrupted and raised by the supply chain issues of the last few years. We reduced both raw material and finished good inventory during the fourth quarter. While we are aware we have further progress to make, we are confident and encouraged by the results our initiatives are delivering so far. As we progress to a more normalized environment, we will realize additional benefits from these changes. For example, we expect to see reductions in expedited freight and less than truckload shipping costs and will streamline other transportation inefficiencies. With the recent opening of our new Maryland logistics center, we are able to eliminate expensive external warehouse costs before even fully realizing the inventory reduction, accelerating the expense savings. With more efficient manufacturing and lower inventory levels, we expect low material losses. We have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years. I am confident in our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain while prioritizing meeting our customers' needs. The impact of our actions is expected to normalize our supply chain cost, enhance our efficiency and ability to meet demand, reduce inventory levels and ultimately increase our profit realization as reflected in our 2023 outlook. Our global operating effectiveness program has considerable momentum and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you after our first quarter of 2023. Now moving to fourth quarter business updates for each of our segments. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 8, sales performance in the quarter was impacted by factors mentioned previously, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, exits of businesses and COVID-related disruptions in China as well as trade inventory dynamics between years. These factors as well as lapping high COVID-related demand early in the year also impacted the full year performance. Importantly, on a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at a 5% CAGR, driven by the Americas region, but we are ending the year with positive momentum in our consumption trend. Now for some regional highlights on sales and consumption. Starting with the Americas, during the fourth quarter of 2021 because we were restocking, shipments were higher than consumption and we are lapping that this quarter, which impacts our sales growth. As we entered the holiday season this year and having shifted fairly in line with consumption for the first three quarters of the year, customers did not need to replenish their inventory as much despite strong consumer consumption during the holiday season. We estimate our fourth quarter sales growth rate was unfavorably impacted 6% related to these restocking comparisons. We did not fully appreciate the level of fourth quarter restocking in 2021, especially of high-margin holiday herbs and spices and the resulting impact on our year-over-year growth and as such, had expected stronger sales growth this year. That said excluding this impact, our underlying volume performance in the fourth quarter was better than in the second and third quarters. We have confidence that as we move out of the first quarter, the holiday season fluctuations this year between consumption and inventory levels as well as retailer restocking resulting from pandemic-driven dynamics will have normalized and we have an increased level of confidence in our visibility. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption growth was 6% this quarter, as indicated by our IRI consumption data combined with unmeasured channel was the strongest of the year. Our investments in brand marketing and stronger holiday merchandising proved to be effective. And with the stabilization of supply disruptions, restoration of our service levels continued and our fourth quarter service level was the best of the year, just shy of our pre-pandemic standards. Our consumption dollar sales, unit and volume all accelerated sequentially and our total distribution points or TDPs have stabilized. In spices and seasoning, our fourth quarter performance was the strongest of the year. Consumers are responding to our value messaging, trading up to larger sizes and according to our consumer insights are learning to navigate the current environment. We are continuing to build distribution on the Lawry's everyday spice range we launched last quarter and early results are positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category as consumers are trading up to this line for private label. In recipe mixes, we gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter and with improved packaging supply, we also gained share in hot sauce and mustard during the quarter. Across the portfolio, our trends are continuing to strengthen in the first quarter of 2023. In EMEA, we ended the year with our strongest sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our effective pricing and new product growth accelerated versus the first three quarters with our fourth quarter price realization, the highest of the year and our volume decline, the lowest. Our strong consumption momentum continued and accelerated sequentially. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we gained share versus last year and 2019 in the UK and Eastern Europe herbs, spices and seasoning. Those gains were somewhat offset by softer performance in France. In the UK, we are driving the hot sauce category with Frank's RedHot continuing to gain share again in the quarter and for the full year versus last year as well as compared to 2019. Additionally, in the UK, we advanced our recipe mix leadership during 2022 to the number one share position. As we entered 2023, we are confident in our continued momentum in the EMEA region. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low margin business in India, which we will lap after the first quarter of 2023 as well as the COVID-related disruption in China. Reflected in our outlook, we are expecting continued disruption into the first quarter of 2023 with an expected recovery after the Chinese New Year. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives are driving positive momentum with more to come from 2023 and we look forward to sharing this and our growth plans at CAGNY in a few weeks. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9, sales growth reflected pricing actions as well as higher base volume growth in new products. Our sales performance has been outstanding all year, led by double-digit growth every quarter in the Americas and EMEA regions, resulting in 12% growth for the full year. On a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at an 8% CAGR with strong growth in all three regions. Now for some regional highlights. Our Americas fourth quarter sales growth was the strongest of the year. Growth in flavors, including snack seasonings and flavors for performance nutrition and health end market applications, as well as branded foodservice products drove our fourth quarter performance as well as our strong broad-based growth for the year. We continue to realize the benefits from the combined capabilities of FONA and McCormick with new products contributing approximately 30% more growth in Flavors in 2022 than last year. Demand continues to strengthen with branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers and we are also expanding distribution and gaining share in both spices and seasonings and hot sauce. In EMEA, our strong fourth quarter performance in all product categories capped an outstanding year of 17% growth, including significant volume growth of 9% as well as pricing. We are winning in all markets and channels. Growth remains strong across our customer base led by the momentum with our quick-service restaurant or QSR customers, partially driven by expanded distribution and their promotional activities. In APV, we are driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, realizing growth from strong performance of core menu item sweet flavor. We delivered solid growth in the APC region for the year despite the COVID-related disruptions in China. Across markets outside of China, we drove double-digit growth with contributions from both volume and pricing. Overall, Flavor Solutions demand has remained strong. And for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand, driving extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us and are encouraged by the results our collaboration is already beginning to yield. While our Flavor Solutions sales growth has been outstanding, we are not delivering profit growth in this segment. We are committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We are confident we will achieve margin recovery through three actions, effective price realization. Our price increases are only now catching up to the pace of inflation and we are beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing live last year. The successful execution of the global operating effectiveness program I just mentioned, in particular, we expect the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies and the investments in capacity to have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, continued focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our customer engagement approach and culinary inspired innovation are driving our outstanding flavor solution momentum. We look to sharing more about our growth plan and margin recovery at CAGNY in a few weeks. Now some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 10, global demand for Flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rise in global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, but the younger generation stealing them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the dynamic global environment. As we look ahead to 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals that drove our industry leading historical financial performance remains strong and we are confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2022 and the momentum they are driving in 2023. Now, I will turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. Our fourth quarter sales performance despite challenges from the COVID-related disruptions in China reflects the underlying strength of our global portfolio and the continued execution of our long-term strategies. With the stabilization of service and our supply chain in addition to positive momentum and consumption trends, we expect an acceleration in consumer segment sales dollars and volume in 2023 and continued strong flavor solutions performance as the strength of our portfolio is net with outstanding demand across our customer base. We have strong growth programs, and we look forward to sharing them at CAGNY. We are committed to increasing our profit realization. The actions we have underway to normalize our supply chain costs and increase our organizational effectiveness and efficiency are already yielding results. Our global operating effectiveness program is expected to deliver $125 million of cost savings. We expect the benefits of the program to scale up through each quarter of 2023 and continue to be accretive into 2024. While actively responding to the macroeconomic challenges we are facing, we continue to operate with the same discipline and commitment to execution as we have in any other operating environment. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in both 2023 and beyond. The compelling benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. Before turning to your questions, I want to reiterate my confidence and driving the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 outlook. And now for your questions. Hi, Andrew. Sure. This almost comes off of my final comments on the prepared remarks. We really believe that this is balanced guidance. It is certainly not aggressive. We have a due degree of humility after last year and have a balanced outlook considering risk. And we have a high degree of confidence in this guidance, including the operating profit guidance. It's underscored by our strong consumer demand and the underlying demand from the consumer is quite strong coming out of fourth quarter is actually the strongest demand, consumer demand, that we've seen. And we continue to have tremendous demand from our Flavor Solutions customer. We have very strong programs that we did not talk about on this call, particularly on herbs and spices and we will be sharing those growth programs at CAGNY. And so that is a foundation, underlying the performance on operating profit. We have very strong confidence in our ability to realize the cost savings that we described. These programs are being managed programmatically through the same team that manages our CCI program. And I believe that they are very much in our control and we're quite confident about them. And I think that they more than offset the build of incentive comp. And maybe what some of the people you're talking about haven't fully considered is that we expect to cover not only this year's cost inflation, but also recover all of the costs that we have lagged over the last 2 years our pricing actions early in the year. And as you know, pricing actions take time to sell in. So you would be correct in assuming that many of these conversations are either completed or well underway at this time. I am going to say a couple of words about that and I'm going to let Brendan follow me. First of all, on that pricing, I would not forget that the significant portion of it is going to be on the Flavor Solutions side of the business. It's sort of confident when those have come up and allowed us to make some moves there. And so that is certainly a big part of the pricing equation. Our inflation outlook is higher actually on the Flavor Solutions inputs than on consumer input for the year. And so the pricing is similarly skewed more towards the Flavor Solutions side of it. I'm going to let Brendan talk about the price gaps and take it from here please. Hey, Ken. Good morning. Start with the last part of it, Ken. We've seen some moderation of elasticity as we've gone through the year. It looks like peak elasticity was around the time when gas prices were at $5 a gallon and above for most of the country and was really not so much a reaction to our price increase, but to the general level of inflation that consumers were experiencing and the high pressure on their wallet. So our outlook for 2023 seems that the similar environment carries forward and that we're seeing elasticity in that range. We've also adjusted \u2013 we've looked at \u2013 we've seen where we've had greater elasticity and where we've got less elasticity, and we've reflected that in our future pricing actions. So I think that we've really been thoughtful around the question of elasticity. We do expect the consumer to be under pressure in 2023. I don't care whether you call it a recession or a soft landing. Consumers on the lower end of the income spectrum, not even \u2013 I'm not talking about the bottom, I'm talking about the lower half. I'm certainly going to have less money and are going to be careful with their budgets. We are reflecting that in our marketing programs already, and with some of the innovation that we've launched. It's not all about buying the cheapest product that consumers are looking for value, and that's really come through clear on our proprietary research and value has many components. It is true that our sales growth is driven primarily by pricing in 2023. And at the total company level, we expect volumes to be pretty much flat. And so that would be an improvement in the trend line, but that's going to vary tremendously by region and a good bit of the overall volume growth is going to come from recovery in China following this we expect following this quarter where we have that tremendous COVID impact right now during Chinese New Year. That's a great question, Ken. I'm going to pass that straight to Brendan. Well, I don't think that we are giving or providing a split between the growth rates on consumer and flavor solutions. And I will say that we would expect higher growth on flavor solutions in 2023. We have \u2013 if nothing else, a higher level of pricing expected in the Flavor Solutions segment, and that alone is going to drive a higher increase year-on-year. Flavor Solutions is a bit of a portfolio itself. It includes branded foodservice, where we believe that we have gained significant share in North America, in particular, in our branded foodservice business with the number of wins as we have gone through the year. We have had tremendous growth on flavors and flavor seasonings, for our flavor solutions customers in the area of snacks, performance nutrition. The health end market, we have had a very strong unit growth through the entire pandemic and continuing through \u201822, and we have seen no end of sight on that. We have been slightly capacity constraint in that area. And we have some significant new capacity that for longer term investments that are finally coming on line in the second quarter that opens up additional capacity for us that's both for flavor with some expansion that we have done. And at bona or spray drying capability, and in snack seasonings, where we have been in the process of converting one of our plants from some low-margin products, the ability to run a snack seasonings and that conversion is effectively coming online. We are in the trial stages right now, should be online in second quarter. So, a bit of a longish answer there, but I hope that covered it. Hi Alexia. Yes. I mean I wasn't really being specific on the dual running costs when I was describing the improvement in flavor solutions. In terms of the pricing, I don't want to get overly specific on this because we are in customer conversations right now. And there is a certain amount of commercial tension in all of those conversations. But we fully expect, as I have said about pricing generally on the flavor solutions side of the business as well that we will recover all of the inflation that we are not only incurring into the New Year, but also the cumulative inflation that we collected \u2013 that we have experienced the last two. And I would say that our lag in getting that getting caught up is greater in flavor solutions than it has been on the consumer side. So, it's going to be \u2013 it's pretty meaningful and that's an important element. We would fully expect to have that work complete early in the year. Alexia. I would love to answer that question, but I am going to let Brendan answer it. We actually would have loved to have done that on this call and Kasey has insisted that we see some higher power. I know your question, Alexia, was about U.S. herbal and spices specifically. But if I could just step back, if I look at the fourth quarter, we gained share in hot sauce. We have gained substantial share in mustard what we finally are back in full supply. We had our, I think our fifth consecutive quarter in a row of strong share growth in recipe mixes, which \u2013 and everyone forgets those, but their profitability is right there with herbs and spices. And then in many of our international markets, we had share gains in urban spices specifically. So, when you look at the full picture, we have got \u2013 generally, as it has been the case all along, where we have had good supply, we have had the ability to grow our market share. A lot of the share loss that you are seeing is due to TDP losses early in the year that are still being left. And I expect we have won some of those TDPs back and I expect us to continue to do so as we go through \u201823. Good morning Adam. I will add to that, that the guidance that we are giving is balanced and all we have been saying prudent. And just from \u2013 that's our opinion. And as you have heard from some of the other questions, that there is somebody think that this actually might even be aggressive. But we have tried to give a balanced guidance here, but our teams are used to winning and have \u2013 we have very aggressive business plans, and we will do everything we can to not just recover, but exceed. We are used to starting every year-end earnings call with record \u2013 with the phrase record results. We were not able to do that this year, and we would like to get back on track with that low record of historic performance. I would say at this point, no. The fact is that our supply chain recovery, I believe and the feedback we get from our customers is generally ahead of the peers. And so many of them are still fairly hand to mouth right now and have a different set of dynamics. Many of them are still rebuilding inventory \u2013 sorry, rebuilding inventories in the store at the shelf and correctly getting items reinstated. And those in the area of snacking are just experiencing explosive growth. Good morning. Yes. I will say that the promotional activity isn't all about discounting. And so a lot of the promotional activity that we have been able to reinstate is around merchandising activity, which includes displays and digital partnerships and all \u2013 and these things have very good ROI, and we are quite positive about it. I am going to give the floor here to Brendan though. I will also say that our proprietary consumer survey shows that between May and December, when we have talked with \u2013 we ask consumers about their mechanisms for coping with higher pricing. Trading down to private label and store brands was the item that had the biggest decline in terms of the consumers who certainly were doing that. And so I think that matches up well with what we are seeing through the scanner and our other data. No, Chris. I would say that's not really the relationship we are trying to describe here. We feel like inventories simply retailers had done a lot of restocking in the fourth quarter just 1.1 [ph]. And they just happen to have more on hand as we are going to the holiday season. But I don't believe we are trying to say that they are executing the holiday season differently than they have as normal. Thank you. Max, you're welcome. Great. Thanks. Well, Peter, our incentive comp pays for growth. And we fell short of growth in 2022. And so that's reflected in a very low incentive comp that we didn't take back and confidence to the P&L. As we went through 2022, in 2023, it starts a New Year. And so we are starting with the expectation that we are going to hit our goals. And of course, as we over or under achieve, we will adjust incentive comp as we go through the year. Great. Thank you. McCormick is aligned with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We are disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We are continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders."

            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Yes, it's still \u2013 Andrew, just to build on and Lawrence has replied. I'll just jump back to maybe, I think one of the points you brought up regarding private label. We are seeing price gaps narrow right now. And we certainly saw that in the fourth quarter, even leading into the first quarter. And we started to see that trade down moderate honestly, through the quarter. So that's kind of an insight. And maybe that's also a reaction just sort of the macro inflationary factors have seem to moderate also out there in the economy overall. Consumers are looking for brands, but they are also looking for value. And so it's not necessarily the lowest price. Parts of our portfolio, we're seeing really start to drive a lot of growth just on large sizes as we see consumers kind of look for that value. We also \u2013 you should have called out, launched this Lawry's everyday line of spices and we are starting to continue to build distribution on this, but the early results are really good, in fact, maybe better than what we expected. We're seeing a lot of incremental category sales and profit coming from this line, those because consumers are trading up from private label. That's kind of the source of volume that we're seeing coming from this and it's bringing in new consumers into the McCormick portfolio. So we are \u2013 we like the results so far that this is providing. But that's certainly a good outcome, and it factors into how we think about next year. On pricing, just sort of comparing quarter-to-quarter, to your point, I think that's probably more a function of the fact that we've been reinstating promotional activity that's been, I think, called out previously. We're also lapping last year's increases, which were higher on a relative basis. But also our volume is in the fourth quarter had an impact on that overall level of pricing, too. So we've covered that with regard to the restocking comparison, and that's factored into that quarter-to-quarter view. Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. Definitely, this environment, certainly volatile, made it tougher to read. But as we think about just moving forward, it's definitely going through, I think this period of time has allowed us to kind of refine how we look at your restocking and just the fluctuations particularly coming out of the season between consumption and shipments. This has allowed us, I think, to kind of refine our view. Overall, we definitely had a pretty disciplined approach to it is even prior to the pandemic, but I think this is refine how we look at it in the tools that we use, the analytics that we apply. So we have a lot of confidence going into this next year, particularly as we exit the first quarter that just the fluctuations that we typically would see during the holiday season between consumption and shipments. And then on top of that, this restocking comparison, things begin to normalize. I think is our view as we come out of Q1 providing just a little bit more stability in that read. Thanks Lawrence. Alexia, I just \u2013 as we look at our business, I think just first, remarking on the fourth quarter. I think what we were really feeling pretty \u2013 feel pretty good about in terms of the momentum we have talked about before is that we have seen sequential improvement not only across the total McCormick portfolio and consumer in the U.S., but also in herbs and spices. Fourth quarter is probably our best quarter of the year. We saw sequential improvement on not only sales, but also unit and also volume as we went through the second quarter all the way to the fourth quarter. So, that's pretty good momentum going into the next year. Having said that, though, certainly, we saw a stabilization of where our share is right now and expect to improve that over the course of \u201822. But we don't never really get into the habit of sort of projecting what share will be in the future. So, we are not going to do that on this call necessarily, but we do expect to have improved performance in \u201823. And I think related to what those plans will be, we will talk a lot more about that at CAGNY. And so I think there will be a lot of great opportunity to kind of go deeper on what those plans and opportunities look like. If I could build on that, Lawrence. Adam, the other thing to consider regarding our flavor solutions business is a good part of that sales growth algorithm is a lot of new product and innovation activity for our customers as well as winning new customers and winning share in the market. And so that factors into how we think about our growth. Yes. I mean Chris, I think as we go into \u201823 and how we look at it, just to build off of where Lawrence is going, a lot of that promotional spending is getting back into driving the categories with our customers. And the feedback we are getting from them is welcome, frankly, in that regard because we want to keep driving up better overall growth. Can you just remind me the front end of your question, though, was in regards to what? I think you are seeing a confluence of a number of things happening in the quarter where some of those macro factors that we may have spoken about before, like the price of gas, etcetera, those seem to have moderated. So therefore, broadly, we think that has an impact. So, also the reinstatement of promotions probably during, obviously, a very important season like the holiday would have also a year-over-year impact there, too. But I think there is a couple of things we would like to add is we got more aggressive in Q4 for a reason. We called that out in the third quarter. And part of that includes also a lot of focus and an increased A&P around value messaging. And we have seen a lot of great response from that. And so I think there is a number of things playing in here, Chris, that lead us to believe that we have got good momentum going into \u201823."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 13, our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India and the customer business in Russia and a 1% impact from China consumption disruption related to COVID restrictions. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 4% with the divestiture of Kitchen Basics contributing 1% to the decline and the combined impact of exiting the businesses in India and Russia as well as the China consumption disruption, contributing 3% to the decline. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency. Pricing actions in the region were more than offset by a volume decline, including a 2% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as a 6% impact from lapping the restocking and retail inventory in the fourth quarter of last year and a higher level of retail inventories entering this year's holiday season. Additionally, returning to pre-pandemic promotional levels also tempered our sales comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 2%. Pricing actions across all markets were partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 22%, including a 23% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 14% primarily due to pricing actions with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth in all regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13%, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Higher sales of packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand for branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. In EMEA, we drove 16% constant currency sales growth, with 10% related to pricing actions and 6% behind the mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth was broad-based across this portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and packaged food and beverage company customers. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, driven by strength in their core menu items. As seen on Slide 21, adjusted gross margin declined 410 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. I will spend a moment on the significant drivers, highlighting the ones that drove more compression than we had expected. First, approximately 60% of this decline or 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, product mix was unfavorable as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as well as compared to our expectations for the quarter. First, in our Consumer segment. As mentioned earlier, lower U.S. spices and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022, as well as lower sales of higher-margin products in China due to the COVID restrictions negatively impacted mix. Sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The impact of the unfavorable product mix was higher than we expected due to the shortfall in consumer sales from what we had anticipated driven by both lower U.S. and China sales. Now for the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins. In our Consumer segment, we experienced lower operating leverage because of the sales comparisons already discussed. The impact, though, was greater than expected due to the China COVID-related plant shutdowns. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we transition production to our new UK Peterborough manufacturing facility, we continue to incur dual running costs. We expect the unfavorable year-over-year impact of these costs to continue in the first quarter of 2023. And then for the balance of the year, expect them to be comparable to 2022. Additionally, we are still incurring elevated costs to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful short-term, we know these investments to support our customers during periods of disruption are the right approach to drive long-term growth. That said, we did make progress on reducing the level of these costs in the fourth quarter. However, the impact of that progress was offset by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates and some discrete issues we experienced in our Flavor Solutions operations during the quarter. While we recovered quickly from these issues, they still contributed significant unexpected costs to the quarter. Finally, partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI cost savings. And of note, our price increases continue to catch up with cost inflation during the quarter for both segments. This was in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance. In 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation or pricing has lagged over the last 2 years. Now moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administration expenses for SG&A declined from the fourth quarter of last year with lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A declined 270 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 9% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 26%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 23, our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter 2021 as well as over our third quarter of this year, both driven by the higher rate environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with higher interest expense and a higher fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate also contributing to the decrease. On Slide 25, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $652 million, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $397 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $262 million for capital expenditures in 2022. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. In 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to 2022 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With improving our gross margin, through our plan to normalize our supply chain costs and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt and expect to de-lever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2024. Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook on Slide 26, our 2023 outlook reflects our positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by significantly higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be minimal impact from currency rates. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which we expect to be consistent with 2022 at low levels that we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China. Although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. And finally, the continued pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. This adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and global operating effectiveness programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our global operating effectiveness program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. Based on the anticipated timing of certain items, we expect our adjusted operating profit growth to be pressured in the first quarter, accelerated in the second quarter and returned to normalized cadence of delivery for the remainder of the year. The impact of cost inflation will be weighted toward the first half of 2023, with peak inflation in the first quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we expect continued pressure to sales and profit from COVID-related disruptions in China and then the benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping last year's impact. Additionally, the exit of our consumer business in Russia will impact the first quarter. As a reminder, we began exiting it during the second quarter of last year. Finally, related to profit timing, while we expect a minimal impact from currency rates, we project an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and expected 3% unfavorable in the first quarter and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% and based on our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2020 earnings growth. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10%, a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the global operating effectiveness program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the incentive compensation rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023. No, I think. Some of that is internal to me. Our supply chain is really operating at a much higher level now than it has an investment service perspective and stability. That's another thing that gives us better insight into our sales. Hey Rob, it's Mike. I will answer that. I mean I would say this, I mean we are taking \u2013 we have a very large actually footprint in one part of the UK and then the Petersburg plant, which we talked about is a massive facility. So, we are kind of doing this in a two-step process to make sure we service our customers properly. So, it's different than when you are just building new capacity like we have talked about, where you are kind of adding on to a plant. We are actually closing a plant in a very difficult environment to close plants for a lot of reasons, moving it to a brand-new facility. So, that does take more time. The good news is we are kind of almost out of that after the first quarter. You think about the incremental costs we have talked about is in the first quarter after it levels out. And as that production \u2013 the remaining production transfers over the rest of this year, \u201824 will be a really clean year. But when you are closing big plants and opening a big plant, they don't take one quarter, it will take about a year, if you think about it, that's what this one is taking around that much time. I think the other point, too, Alexia, a couple of things. We talked about inflation being weighted to the front of the year. First quarter is the highest inflation that impacts labor solutions as well as consumer. The other thing is our global operating effectiveness program. I mean there has been a lot of positive activity. The reality though is the first quarter is going to have the least impact and it's going to ramp up really rapidly in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. So, the second quarter is going to be a big impact. The flavor solutions because a lot of the inefficiencies we have talked about over the last year have been in the supply chain area for flavor solutions. So, we do see more of that savings going to that segment, which will help. Adam, this is Mike. Good question. I mean we put together the slide in the earnings deck to really walk you from the current guidance. And from a percentage basis, realizing it's not dollars, but from a percentage basis, constant currency guidance to the underlying base growth. And if you think about it, you look at that underlying base for, once you take out all the kind of I hate to say one-timers, but things are really discrete items year-over-year, and some of which will continue into next year, like the global operating effectiveness program, as you talked about rebuilding there are profit getting back to our long-term profit algorithm by taking out these costs that have really come through during the pandemic. So, I think there is a case for acceleration into the future. We are not talking about \u201824 or \u201825 right now. We need to nail \u201823. But if you look at that underlying base growth 4% to 6% net sales growth, which actually went out bolt-on M&A is at the high end of our guidance. So, really good underlying performance. We get back to the 7% to 9% operating profit growth. If you really if you think about the recovery of the pricing that we talked about, that allows us to really drive that 3 percentage point increase will get to that 7% to 9%. So, we feel good about that, along with our noble things like our normal CCI program and things like that, investing a bit more in advertising to grow the brand. So, that virtuous cycle we talk about is to get the operating profit and 1% leverage below there, we would love to pay down more debt. That's why we are driving hard on our working capital programs this year to get our inventories back down to where they need to be. So, we feel good about like Lawrence said before, it's a prudent call. We feel really confident about it. And so I think hopefully that helps you understand the moving parts other than the discrete items, some of which the positives will continue into next year, even the net recovery in China, hopefully \u201824 is better than the \u201823. But we feel good about on base. We did start making progress on our inventory in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned both in the raw material and finished goods side, which was really a focus with our global operating excellence for efficiency program. One of the outputs of that is reduced inventory too as you stabilize your supply chain. And we have very aggressive targets for this year. And again, it goes back to creating more cash to help drive our debt down. Progress is just starting. Yes. And just in the normal ebb and flow of things. Remember, our fiscal year end stands in the middle of the holiday season. So, coming in the first quarter, retailer inventories are always high. We always ship below consumption in the first quarter. That's like a normal seasonal pattern. And I think that we are well set up for that. Just given the rapid amount of change, we are just being cautious about that. And in our remarks, we have said we expect normalization after Q1. Yes. I mean I think on top of that, the highest commodity cost increases in the first quarter. I think the first quarter is always our smallest quarter. If you think about the cadence of, Max, in our history, fourth quarter are the most sales and most profit comes through because of the holiday season. Except for China, which is actually inversed. China's first quarter is their biggest quarter because of the Chinese New Year. So, that's another factor that's going to put pressure on our first quarter this year because of the COVID issues. But I would hesitate to say we get round number is what it's going to be, but it's going to be a difficult first quarter. For all the factors, you named four or five of the factors right on our list. I added the China impact also into that. So, as well as FX. FX is flat for the year, Max, but in the first quarter, it's about a 3% negative year-on-year. So, that's another reason that the first quarter is going to be the most challenging, but for all the reasons you mentioned with the global operating effectiveness, the recoveries and it will be strong for the rest of the year. Yes, it's very formulaic. The majority of our incentive competence based on McCormick profit, which is basically our operating profit less a capital charge we call kind of light EVA model to make sure all of us are held accountable for capital improvement. So, it's really focused a lot on operating profit and a bit on EPS, too, very formulaic. We pay for growth."

Third quarter sales increased 3% from the year ago period as anticipated. In constant currency, sales grew 6%, reflecting 10% growth from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and 1% decline attributable to the exits of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia and a 2% decline in all other volume and product mix. Our underlying third quarter growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio as well as the effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, third quarter sales grew at a constant currency three-year compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, up 7%, reflecting the sustained momentum in our business across both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Moving to profit, adjusted operating income was down 12% or 11% in constant currency adjusted earnings per share was down 14%. During the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued and recovery of certain constrained materials is taking longer than expected. We continue to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in our Flavor Solutions segment. While in our Consumer segment, where demand moderated from elevated consumption trends more quickly than expected, we are experiencing lower-than-optimal operating leverage. Across the supply chain, we remain focused on managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies, though the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin and profit realization in the current period. Over the coming months, we will be aggressively eliminating supply chain inefficiencies. Importantly, as we had expected in the third quarter, our price increases are catching up with the pace of cost inflation in both segments. We began to recover the cost inflation that had been outpacing our pricing actions and other levers most significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect this will continue into the next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time. Before discussing our third quarter segment performance in more detail, I'd like to comment on our supply chain plan, starting on Slide 5. We have a focused plan in flight that leverages the discipline of our established Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI program to ensure that we are able to flexibly support customer demand, both where it has been sustained at higher levels and where it has moderated, while eliminating inefficiencies and normalizing both our cost structure and inventory levels. Our actions are well underway. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. There are areas of our business that have sustained high levels of demand for an extended period and our supply chain has been pressured to meet this demand. We have several initiatives in progress that will increase our capacity, strengthen our supply chain resiliency and importantly, enable us to service our customers so they can grow their business. For example, we're investing in additional Flavor Solutions seasoning capacity, which will be online in early 2023. We're expanding FONA's footprint to support our flavor growth. We recently opened our new U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility to support our strong growth momentum with quick service restaurants. And just earlier this week, the first pallet was shipped from our new Maryland Logistics Center. And from a cost perspective, as we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we have incurred additional costs above inflation to service our customers and have seen inefficiencies develop in our supply chain. These are costs we have absorbed. We have not passed into customers on our pricing actions. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs with a significant benefit in 2023. We're moving aggressively to take these costs and inefficiencies out as well as normalized inventory levels that have built up. Some of our actions include investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in bottleneck areas to enable better customer service and repatriation of production from excessive use of co-packers. We're returning to more normal ship schedules and reducing our spend on expensive surge capacity. We are already seeing the benefit of lower overtime and temporary labor reductions. In this more normalized environment as well as through customer collaboration, we are already beginning to reduce expedited freight costs and less-than-truckload shipping costs as well as other transportation inefficiencies. We are resolving raw material and packaging supply issues. For example, we are beyond the shortages of glass bottles and certain organic spices, which impacted supply of our U.S. gourmet line. A supplier facility closure announced in September drove the discontinuation of a component of our dry recipe mix packaging and through our quick qualification of alternative supply, we mitigated a major disruption during the fourth quarter. Long-running shortage of French's mustard bottle will be resolved in the first half of 2023 as new molds come online at a second supplier. And from an inventory perspective, we are also executing on plans to return to historical safety stock levels, which were raised to protect against supply disruption. We expect the impact of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs, increase our efficiency and ability to meet demand, lower our inventory levels and importantly, increase our profit realization beginning in the first half of 2023. We have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years with the peak disruption experienced in the third quarter of last year. Since then, there has been steady improvement building progress and bolstering our confidence in our plan to enhance our operational performance and optimize our cost structure. While we will always prioritize meeting our customers' needs, I'm encouraged by our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain. We've continued to define and quantify specific actions within our plans as we - since we shared we would be driving the elimination of the supply chain inefficiencies in our preannouncement last month. We look forward to sharing more details and progress with you in January, when we provide our 2023 outlook. Now moving to third quarter business update for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 6 and the status of our pricing actions, our third quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions, with an acceleration of effective pricing in the quarter versus the first half of the year, in line with what we expected. While broad pressure on Consumers' cost of lending from inflation, which heightened during our third quarter, has resulted in higher price elasticity than we originally anticipated, our elasticities remain lower than historical levels. And our most recent pricing actions, which in the U.S. took effect as we began our fourth quarter, we focused on areas that are less elastic and did not take pricing on some products where we had seen the highest elasticity. Now, for some further highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 4%, in line with our shipments. And over the last three years, since 2019, consumption has grown at a three-year CAGR of 8%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. In early August, we divested our Kitchen Basics business. We consistently grew this brand over the years but as it was the only U.S. brand we had in the stock and broth aisle our resources were better focused on core categories where we have leading brands. Demand has remained high with strong growth in the majority of our categories. Spices and seasonings has been one of our strongest categories in the past three years. And as a result, we are lapping all-time highs in consumption. This has created challenging comparisons in some product lines, such as baking related items, which have returned to a pre-pandemic level unlike most of our categories. Grilling-related items were impacted versus last year by high meat prices, although grilling is still strong versus pre-pandemic. Health conditions continue to improve as seen in our recipe mix share performance, with the fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured by service-related distribution losses, a shortage of certain packaging items as well as certain organic spices, which has largely been resolved and some trading down by consumers who remain under pressure from broad-based inflation. We are using our category and revenue management capabilities to strengthen our spices and seasoning presence on shelf. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution, which we're beginning to realize now. In EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance at herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We are continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K., and we are beginning to build momentum with Cholula as we expand that brand into this market. For the quarter and year-to-date versus last year, as well as since 2019, we are driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. Our Bottone brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line of unique to our EMEA region, as flows, we have seen baking return to a more pre-pandemic baseline level in EMEA to, again, unlike our other categories. Turning to the Asia Pacific region. Last year, the region experienced supply chain challenges such as ocean freight capacity constraints and lapping that impact contributed to growth in the third quarter. Additionally, following an extended lockdown in the second quarter, COVID resurgence in Shanghai and some other cities throughout China eased as we began the third quarter, resulting in trade and pantry replenishment contributing to growth. Recently, several cities in Central China, which is the primary market of our Wuhan operations, have experienced new COVID-related lockdowns and we are continually monitoring the situation. Overall, our China performance is on track with our expectations. Across all regions in our consumer segment, we are achieving the price realization we expected and we're executing on our proven growth strategies, pivoting action plans as needed based on our consumer insights and the environment. We continue to invest behind our brands. We increased brand marketing investments in the third quarter and have additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. In addition to our highly effective and inspiring holiday messaging, we have pivoted our digital messaging to emphasize value and show consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars without sacrificing flavor. We are focusing our innovation efforts to meet the needs of consumers concerned about their budgets. In the Americas, we have launched a new Lawry's branded opening price point range of every day 10 spices. And our large-size format Super Deal is one of the best-performing product lines as consumers are looking for greater value. This format size is approximately a 40% better value per ounce than the smaller sizes. We've also launched large-sized resealable pouches of top-selling items in markets across all regions. In terms of category management, we are collaborating with our customers to ensure the right assortment and price points on shelf to optimize category performance and increase profitability for our customers. And as always, we have a strong merchandising program planned for the holiday season. We are confident in our brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives, which will continue to drive strong growth. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 8. Our sales performance for the quarter was strong, with growth led by our pricing actions in all three regions with an increase in our effective pricing versus the first half of the year as we expected. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas, strong growth was driven by snack seasonings, savory flavors and branded foodservice products. Demand continues to strengthen the branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers as mobility and strong summer travel continued to fuel consumption. And importantly, we also are expanding distribution. In EMEA, growth remained strong across our entire customer base. Our third quarter growth was led by strong quick service restaurant, or QSR, momentum in all markets partially driven by expanded distribution and our customers' promotional activities. And we're seeing an acceleration of demand in branded foodservice as customers shift to more economical formats. Our full spectrum of solutions across price points is driving growth. We are winning in both regions with our new product momentum. In Americas, growth from new products contributed approximately 25% more growth in flavors in the third quarter than the year ago period, driven by beverage, savory snacks and Performance Nutrition flavors. We are continuing to win share in these categories. And in EMEA, our third quarter new product launches accelerated versus earlier in the year. And for the full year, we expect new product introductions to outpace 2021. We are fueling future growth. In APG, we're driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, winning new limited time offers as well as realizing growth from strong performance of their core menu items we flavor. In many cases, we are the heat in their spicy offerings. Overall, Flavor Solutions has remained strong and for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand. And as I said earlier, we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us, and we see light ahead. Now some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 9. Global demand for Flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio. We are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. Our solid track record of achieving our long-term objectives highlights the resiliency of our business through a variety of market conditions as well as our focus on sales growth and profit realization. The long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong, the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the global dynamic environment. The compounding benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth and balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. The teamwork of our McCormick employees, driver momentum and success and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. And now I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 12. Our top line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, including a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India, and the consumer business in Russia. In our Consumer segment, we drove constant currency sales growth of 4%, with 10% related to pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as lower volume. With the exit of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia contributing a combined 1% impact due to the lower volume. On a three-year basis, our third quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 6%. On Slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by a decline in volume as well as a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. As Lawrence mentioned, the volume decline was impacted not only by elasticities, but also by constrained supply of certain input materials, primarily packaging items. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 6%. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 1%, which included a 3% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Growth in other markets were driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume, with the most significant volume impact attributable to lower sales of Vahine Hommade dessert products. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 10%, including a 7% unfavorable impact from the exit of low-margin business in India. As Lawrence mentioned, growth was driven by higher volume, mainly attributable to trade and pantry replenishments in China, following the extended Shanghai lockdown last quarter, as well as the region lapping supply chain challenges in the year ago period. Pricing actions in all markets across the region also contributed to growth. On a three-year basis, APZ's third quarter constant currency sales grew at a 4% CAGR. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and Slide 16. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 10%, primarily due to pricing actions, with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth. Third quarter constant currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% CAGR. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 10%, driven by pricing. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%. In EMEA, we drove 11% constant currency sales growth, with 7% related to price actions and 4% volume and mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to lower sales in Russia, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR, branded foodservice and packaged food and beverage company customers. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales growth was 9% CAGR. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, in part due to the timing of the promotional activities. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 6% CAGR over the past three years. As seen on Slide 20, adjusted gross profit margin declined 320 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period. Let me spend a moment on the significant drivers. First, almost 80% of this decline, approximately 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, I'll cover the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margin. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand for certain parts of that business. And there has also been an unfavorable impact from the start-up and dual running costs as we transition production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. In our Consumer segment, where demand has moderated more quickly than we expected, we are experiencing lower operating leverage. Overall, while the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected pressure in gross margin, we are taking actions to normalize our costs, as Lawrence mentioned, which we are confident will be reflected in our 2023 gross margin. Partially offsetting these impacts I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings, where we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. And finally, of note, in line with our expectations, the impact of our pricing actions in the third quarter began outpacing cost inflation in both segments, more significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect pricing to continue outpacing inflation into next year, as we plan to fully offset inflation over time. Overall, our cost recovery and gross margin improvement will vary by region and segment, with a slower Flavor Solutions recovery. Importantly, though, we have now passed the inflection point with significant gross margin improvement since last quarter, driven by our consumer segment performance, and, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter. Now moving to Slide 21. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the third quarter of last year with higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments, offset by lower employee benefit expenses. As a percent of net sales, SG&A declined 60 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 1% in constant currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, a decline of 34%. Turning to income taxes on Slide 22. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 14.1% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 23, third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.80 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. A favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio in the third quarter was fully offset by the impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year. On Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and a quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $250 million through the third quarter of 2022, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $298 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $167 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. While our fourth quarter has historically generated our highest cash flow from operations, based on our current profit outlook and working capital position, we do not expect to delever to our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With our improving gross margin as well as our plan to normalize our supply chain cost and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 25. We are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by cost inflation and supply chain challenges. We also expect there will be a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 3% to 5%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by price elasticities, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels given our focused approach led by consumer insights. Our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business. The demand disruptions experienced in China and the exit of our consumer business in Russia as well as continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 350 to 300 basis points lower than 2021, primarily driven by our Flavor Solutions segment. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment this year, cost inflation outpaced pricing in the first half of the year. We expect pricing to outpace inflation in the second half of the year and continue into next year. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, higher supply chain costs, lower operating leverage and unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we have priced to offset dollar cost increases. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect our adjusted operating income to decline 11% to 9% in constant currency. In addition to our gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost - total cost savings target of approximately $85 million and a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments compared to 2021. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68 as compared to $3.05 in 2021. This projection includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Kitchen Basics business. As we currently progress in our fourth quarter, we are confident in delivering our 2022 outlook, continuing our strong top line growth trajectory and as our guidance implies, delivering fourth quarter operating margin expansion while executing on a focused plan to drive improvement in our cost structure. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs or approximately a 150 basis point impact to our operating margin. With our proven track record of delivering CCI-led savings to fuel growth investments and expand our operating margin, we are leveraging the discipline of the CCI program to aggressively eliminate costs and inefficiencies. Overall, we are confident our focus on profit realization will drive margin improvement. And while parts of our plan to optimize our cost structure, will take longer than others, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of our actions in the first half of 2023. We look forward to sharing more details on progress with you in January when we provide our 2023 outlook.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 26. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Our sales growth momentum is strong. Though challenges in our supply chain have taken longer to normalize, we have now passed an inflection point. We have begun to recover the cost inflation that has been outpacing our pricing actions while executing on a plan to aggressively eliminate supply chain costs, and we expect 2022 fourth operating margin expansion and continued improvement into 2023. Our long-term performance, including through periods of volatility and has been industry-leading and long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remains strong. We have a proven track record of execution and are confident we will successfully navigate this dynamic environment for our future sustainable growth and build long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thanks so much.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi. Good morning Ken.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning. You highlighted that you've past the inflection point, right, where your pricing is now ahead of your costs. And this, of course, is natural, right, given the timing and not unexpected. But one of the push-backs we hear in the industry is that larger retail customers, as they start to, I guess, maybe notice these margin trends, they'll start to ask for a bigger piece of the profit pie. So I guess my question is to what extent do you expect sort of these gross margin net tailwinds to be sustainable? Or is it reasonable to expect maybe some pressure from customers as they see their vendors' margins starting to get better?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I think that there's always some tension when you're talking about pricing and margins with customers. And so I don't want to get into anything with any one specific customer. But right now, all of our customers recognize that inflation is ongoing, and we continue to have, I'd say, productive pricing discussions with our customers. We just did take another round that is effective here at fourth quarter. And we're really not seeing that kind of push back right now.\nMike Smith: I think the reality, Ken, is we're still recovering. Our pace of pricing has caught up now with cost and we say, we'll recover dollar to dollar in 2023. But there is a trend that is going in the right direction. And obviously, as we look at 2023, we look at what's the cost environment, things like that, we need to go again next year, but that's still -\nLawrence Kurzius: And I think particularly on the Flavor Solutions side of the business, we have - we still have more work to do.\nKen Goldman: Got it. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, you're guiding to at least $100 million of incremental cost savings. It's not a small number. So I just wanted to get a little bit of clarification. How much of that is incremental to ongoing CCI? And how much of that is derived from maybe a normalization of certain factors such as inventories versus what you would consider more, I guess, discrete savings beyond that?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, first of all, all of this is incremental to our normal CCI program are using the processes and the organization Alpha Drives or CCI program to actually execute on these. This is incremental savings that we are and although some of the - you know I would characterize as a one-time take out the - it goes straight to run rate. These are incremental costs that we have incurred due to extensive search capacity, some of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks. So overtime, temporary labor and efficient shift, excessive use of CO-packers, a lot of premium transportation charges, we do expect to get that out of our system, get back to our pre-pandemic operating standards. And we would expect - while this is a one-time takeout, it goes straight to run rate.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thanks so much. Yes, very clear.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. So Flavor Solutions is really the division that has stumbled the most. I mean, when I look at profit this year compared to like pre-pandemic, it's well below your pre-pandemic levels. So can I assume that most of the $100 million in savings is - or recovery is going to happen there? And then my second question is, I remember years and years ago that the Flavor Solutions had problems because it was trying to do too many things for too many customers. It had spread itself too thin. It needed eventually to have a rationalization of its customer base. And I wanted to make sure that that's not possibly one of the root causes today. You've grown your sales a lot. Do you feel like the organization is capable of still getting back to like 12% operating margin across all of those customers?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. I think that stumble is the wrong way to characterize it. I think that we're a bit of a victim of our own success. We've won a lot of new business, and we prioritized keeping our customers in stock and supplying them. And that has put a lot of pressure on our supply chain in a few areas and we've got projects underway to address kind of a normalization of production and through capacity additions. Some of these wins are substantial, and we've had real brick-and-mortar projects that take a couple of years to put into place that are coming online right now and that are going to get at a lot of the extraordinary costs. There's some parts of our business, the 24/7 shifts that we've gotten out of most of our business, we're still doing that in a lot of our that's why I wouldn't say a lot in parts of our Flavor Solutions business, and that is a less efficient ship pattern even though it does get you some capacity to be an example of expensive surge capacity. But we've got new seasonings capacity coming online in the Americas, some of it now, so some of it in the first - early part of 2023. We're starting up a new flavor solutions plant in the U.K. We've got expanded distribution that that's shipping really starting to ship right now. And so I think that we've got a lot going for us in Flavor Solutions to support that strong growth in a more efficient way. As a margin issue on Flavor Solutions, partly is just the way our contractual arrangements work with our customers, there is a pass-through mechanism for the major raw materials that go into their products. There's a lag to it. In times when inflation was 1%, 2%, 3%, that lag really wasn't important. But this year, where it's been double-digit, it has been important. And we are going to catch that up.\nMike Smith: I think remember, we've talked about this before, over half of the dilution this year is due to the cost versus pricing. So that's just the math that we'll get back over time. Also, these projects, Lawrence mentioned, there's a lot of double running costs as we bring those big projects up like U.K., Peterborough that eventually will go away. So that will help the margins, too. To your point, though, about - are we spread too thin? I actually have to flavor division back in 2005 when that was identified, there's no comparison to today. It's really focus and Lawrence, why don\u2019t you\u2026\nLawrence Kurzius: I was just going to say, Mike, one thing I would add there, Rob, is the composition and the profile of our business is so different to 2005. And this - our strategy to keep driving and evolving the business towards that higher value-added portfolio is what you're seeing in our business portfolio today. And so there's a very different, I think, set of conditions compared to the point you referenced. And we have done a lot of portfolio pruning behind the scenes as we - especially as we went through these last three years, where the extraordinary growth that we have in the parts of the business that we're focused on more than made up for parts of the business where we were getting out of low-margin high-touch businesses. And I think it's been a self-reinforcing strategy. The migration of our business more and more towards the value-added, technically insulated and flavor end of the spectrum has made our product wins stickier and our R&D teams more able to work on new business not focused on constantly re-winning bid business.\nRobert Moskow: Great. I'm sorry to bring up 2005, but we're all old and we all remember it. So maybe just one follow-up. Of the $70 million or so of profit decline this year in Flavor Solutions, can you quantify how much of that is just pricing catch-up?\nMike Smith: I would say - I wouldn't - I think the bigger bucket is actually some of the excess costs that we've talked about, and which actually would have driven more sales if we could have supplied it. But the excess cost that we - for the reason we called down our preannouncement was we haven't been able to get those out of the system yet. Yeah, pricing is a bit behind, I mean, the thing that gives us the comfort that we're going to recover more margin Flavor Solutions is because we've seen it in Consumer. The Consumer is turning positive from a gross margin and an operating profit perspective as pricing wave comes through, and you'll see the same in Flavor Solutions. But I don't have the exact number for you.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thank you and good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nSteve Powers: Picking up on that last thread on the pricing catch up in Flavor Solutions, can you talk a little bit about the expected timing of that and cadence of that? Because it seems like most of it or a good portion of it should be, I think, foreseeable just based on the timing of the contracted adjustments in pricing and contract renewals and that kind of thing. So is it a - should we be expecting a relatively smooth catch-up from here? Or is it - is there a reason to believe that you can - that the catch-up happens on a more accelerated timing.\nLawrence Kurzius: I'd rather describe it more in terms of our gross margin trajectory than to talk about pricing too specifically because I'm worried that it's going to get into things that might have set our customers. But you can see the margin trajectory on this business beginning to turn. We talked about an inflection point. Flavor Solutions margins have been ticking down through the second quarter of the year. They're turning - the year-on-year comparison has narrowed in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to narrow and begin a recovery as we go through next year.\nMike Smith: Yes. I think from a dollar perspective, like I said before, for both Consumer and Flavor Solutions business, we will catch up on the cost next year. We just took branded foodservice, that's supported labor solutions along with our consumer business at the beginning of the quarter, that will be a positive going into next year rapidly. So yes, there's no like one thing bag you catch up. It's over time, but in 2023, we will catch up.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Okay. And on the manufacturing start-up costs are those - I guess, what inning are we in there? And how much of that remains versus is in the rearview?\nLawrence Kurzius: I would say - I mean, from a - you're always going to have some of these programs to say that. So, you're always going to have some of this, I think this year is kind of a high watermark that we should get some get in next year. But some of these programs take a bit of time to get fully, fully done. These are big programs. I mean the project we just shipped our first panel that\u2019s marked down out of our big Northeast distribution center, but we want to move over time into 2023. We'll be moving parts of our business into that. So, there'll be a bit of inefficiency there. But...\nMike Smith: And I want to just emphasize that the things that we talked about on the call in terms of getting out the - on our prepared remarks in terms of getting at the cost for example. So, I don't want to overly focus on any one particular thing and give it too much weight. We were sharing examples and when we next report in January, we'll be able to give some progress updates on those exact examples as well as for other actions.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you. If I could, just one little housekeeping, sorry if I missed it but - just was there anything notable that caused - that resulted in reported EBIT this quarter coming in above what you had preannounced at quarter close, just anything as you close the books that was...\nLawrence Kurzius: Like I said, we've preannounced, we haven't closed our books yet. So these are all estimates and we felt pretty good where we landed. There was a couple of things. Tax came in a little bit more favorable at about penny, some other SG&A things came in a little bit more favorable, but nothing material\u2026\nSteve Powers: No wonder.\nLawrence Kurzius: And right where we thought.\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean when we preannounced it was say -\nLawrence Kurzius: We had a little bit more visibility on the sales versus profit and between Q3 and Q4, there's a little shift.\nSteve Powers: Yes, okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Thank you. good morning.\nLawrence Kurzius: Hi, good morning, Chris. How are you?\nChris Growe: No worries. No, thank you for accommodating my question. I appreciate it. I just wanted to get a couple of, I guess, follow-up questions. I just want to be sure on that lag in pricing in Flavor Solutions. When we talked some of the pass along features of that business, that had typically been like a one quarter lag, is that still the case? Or have you caught up now when you talk about pricing being over inflation at is, have you caught up with that? And I guess, I just want to also understand, was that a factor weighing on profit in the quarter? Or was it more just the supply chain challenges?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, of course, it was a factor weighing on profit in the quarter end and has been all year. Again, every customer has got to sell different contractual arrangements. I think about a quarter lag is a good way to think about it. But remember, costs keep coming in. I mean we didn't just get cost inflation on January 1 and price for it. These costs have been steadily increasing all year, and in fact, continue to increase. The inflationary outlook has not settled. So there's been a bit of a - we've gotten - we've passed costs there, but there's been a bit of chasing it as new as costs have continued to go up. I'm going to let Brendan comment on this a little further.\nBrendan Foley: Well, it's true. I think just the thing I would key in on is there is unlike, let's say, our consumer and our Flavors - our branded foodservice business, there's not sort of one moment in time where that pricing is, therefore, effective in the business. And so that's another way to maybe think about it, Chris. And I think just to build on part of your question, certainly, supply chain, as we've been talking about quite a bit in the prepared remarks, we're certainly an influence on how we're looking at that. \nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just to understand if I'm hearing it properly, but like the pricing should accelerate in the fourth quarter, it sounds like there will be, again, some continued catch-up in pricing, I guess that's true for Flavor Solutions. I think about Consumer, is that one where we should expect incremental pricing based on what you've announced so far, not asking for anything new there. But I also want to understand maybe how you're utilizing promotional spending there as a means of trying to trying to attack those price gap issues in some areas of the business there?\nLawrence Kurzius: I think you've got - I'm going to try and unpack that in pieces. We have been guiding all year. And it - and you can see it coming through now and not just in our reported numbers, but also through the scanner. But we would have more pricing in effect in the second half of the year, especially going into the fourth quarter than we have - than we did in the early part of the year. We've - in the Americas this year, taken a number of rounds of pricing that included the most recent one being here right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And so there is more pricing in effect now about our consumer business primarily there. And so you can see that coming through now. And really, other than the contractual windows that we were just talking about in Flavor Solutions, we largely have our actions for this year in place and we're looking ahead to 2023 now. I think that in Asia, we've got one more round that goes into effect actually this month. But really, our 2022 actions are away. And I gave such a long answer to that, but I forgot the second part of your question, but I'm going to let Brendan answer it.\nBrendan Foley: So I think where you were going was just looking for some context around promotional spending. And I think the context we would provide is as we go into the holiday, we feel really good about our supply. We have a strong program planned for the holiday season as we would every year. But it certainly feels, I think, a little bit more robust now compared to, let's say, 2021 and 2020 just because we're in a better situation from the standpoint of the overall context in the market. So, we are turning back on promotions where we feel really confident about supply, and we're looking at the holiday season that way. Those choices are not necessarily connected to any pricing decisions we're making in the market, but really to support of the business. And helping to drive the category for our retailers.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. And I would say that our supply situation on the consumer business going to holiday is the best it's been in the last several years.\nChris Growe: That\u2019s great. Thanks for all that context. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Good morning everybody.\nMike Smith: Hi.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Maybe to start off, I think when you had preannounced results for the quarter, one of the factors that you had highlighted in the Consumer business was that sort of private label price points at some retailers on shelf had not yet really sort of moved upward leading to some price gaps that get wider maybe than you'd like or had been anticipated. And if I missed this, I apologize. I didn't know if that you've seen any movement there yet or have heard of any movement that's likely to happen on that front.\nLawrence Kurzius: Right. Andrew, no one has asked that yet. So I'm glad that you did not only a very short time since we preannounced. And so we don't have a lot of new information on consumer behavior or on retailer behavior. I'll let Brendan give some color on that, and then I'll take it back.\nBrendan Foley: Yes, I think, Andrew, things are largely consistent with what we had discussed or shared broadly within the last four weeks. So, we haven't really seen a lot of new information or data. They seem this price gap seem to be kind of holding in the very same range that we talked about before. And - but we still are a leading supplier of private label into the category and we're passing those price increases along to customers just as we have on branded products and that's a retailer-by-retailer decision, I think, on what gets realized itself. But in the meanwhile, we're still driving a lot of that value programming that we had talked about whether it's not only our messaging, but also we're seeing a lot of lift in some of those parts of our portfolio that tend to drive more value. We offer - our offerings are really across the spectrum that would meet consumers' needs. And we're seeing growth on the premium end, we're seeing growth on the value end. In parts of our business like Gourmet Garden, which tend to be on the premium end, are actually doing really well in this context. And then we see our value sizes like super deal performing very strongly, also off shelf and in the market. And then we're introducing more value into the market through this opening price point worries program. And we're also doing that in other parts of our - in other markets around the world where we're - and many of them were launching re-sealable pouches that are larger than usual and allow consumers to kind of realize more value that way. But that's probably the added context I would share since the last month.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. And Andrew, it isn't exactly what you've asked, but it gives - give me a chance to talk about this a little bit. I want to emphasize that we have in our offering items for every price point and every retailer strategy and category from the premium end all the way down to opening price points and private label. And we spent a fair bit of time talking about the consumer that's under pressure and rightly so, we are concerned about pressure on the consumer, especially, the consumers on the lower half of the income spectrum. And we want to make sure that our products are accessible and approachable, but gourmet and premium end of our business is still very strong. And sometimes those price gaps can be exaggerated. And Brendan mentioned large size and super deal. The Nielsen data is a pretty blunt instrument when it reports unit price. It doesn't catch the fact that some of these value packs are really big and carry a high price point. If you adjust that out, the lower size packs that are growing strongly for us and that price gap actually narrows quite a bit.\nAndrew Lazar: That's very helpful perspective. And then I know we're running short on time. Just a quick one. Obviously, we're not at a point where you're going to get too specific at all about next year, of course. But with, sort of, the inflection that's starting to happen in pricing, the new cost saves and over - margin recovery actions that you've kind of highlighted today, I guess, consensus already has McCormick, sort of, getting back to what we'll call more of an on-algorithm type of earnings growth next year, particularly as you would deem, I think, a bunch of the things you talked about impacting this year is somewhat more transitory as you improve them going forward. So I didn't know if there were even just any broad comments around that, whether there's a need, you think, to lean in right on the marketing side going into next year, just given whatever the value orientation of the consumer or some of the new product innovations you've got planned? Or just things larger puts and takes that we should sort of think about as given how, I guess, the Street has already started to sort of lock in expectations for next year? Thanks so much.\nLawrence Kurzius: So I will start with the caveat that we're not going to give any guidance for 2023. Right now, I've got - everyone is standing around here with - holding their breath - if I'm going to say something rash about that. But - so it is a bit early for that. And I appreciate saying confidence in the investment community that's reflected in those consensus outlook. But there are some big puts and takes. I'm going to let Mike talk about those.\nMike Smith: Yes. Obviously, a big wild part for next year is the inflation environment. So we're in the process now actually rolling up budgets and things like that, taking a look that drives pricing actions. Obviously, some of the other puts and takes you think about interest expense. Obviously, some of the actions we took this year might be a negative for next year. This cost pro we talked about, which we're going to give you a lot more detail in January. So I'd say, right now, there's so many big moving parts, it would be hard even to give you any guidance about.\nLawrence Kurzius: And frankly, incentive comp has to be rebuilt.\nMike Smith: Right.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So a lot of ground has been covered. I wanted to just come back to Flavor Solutions quickly and just the way you'd characterize, kind of, the business performance on the strong demand. And I guess I'm trying to - volume mix in the quarter was up 80 basis points. And so I'm just trying to get a little bit more color on kind of the pieces within the Flavor Solutions business because it's not really one business. It's a collection of a bunch of them. It would seem from the way you characterized some areas of strength that maybe some of the higher-value flavor businesses were at or below kind of segment average growth? And just, A, is that the right calibration? And B, just any color on the growth of the - some of the different pieces?\nLawrence Kurzius: You know, certainly the pick of the part of it that was weak. We had strong performance on Flavor Solutions in that segment across the globe and really all segments. I'm sorry, I'll that's not to say all regions and all of the pieces of it. Well, maybe a little bit out maybe we did talk about a month ago. I mean some of the challenges on Flavor Solutions this year were cost related to plaque constraints. We could have sold more. We could have had higher volumes than you noted. So, I think from that perspective, some of the actions we've talked about it more capacity will help. But the demand is very strong and is very strong.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. All right. I just - I guess, relative to historical performance of that business, the 80 basis points of volume mix growth. And I know there's noisiness in the comps with COVID recovery and it's a lumpy business that doesn't always - usually that business could be stronger than 80 basis points of volume mix. So I'm trying to get the calibration of that.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. We had enormous price [indiscernible] 10% pricing, we feel pretty good about.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then just quickly on SG&A, and you alluded to in - think about '23 a little bit. But it would seem like the way the gross margin and EBIT guidance lays out implied for the fourth quarter that total SG&A is going to be down high single digits. A, is that kind of the right calibration? And within that, just how much is incentive comp resetting lower talk about kind of the declines in SG&A dollars that you've seen this year?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, SG&A, you're right, it's going to be down in the quarter, and it's primarily driven by the incentive comp. We're also getting higher fixed cost leverage, too, as you think about it, but - yes.\nAdam Samuelson: So is most of that decline in incentive comp as we think about the headwind that would be rolling into next year?\nMike Smith: I mean we adjust incentive comp every quarter, so I wouldn't take one quarter to then try to extrapolate the next year.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hi guys. Good morning. Just two really quick ones for me. Maybe just to pick up on Adam's question there. Mike, I just wanted to clarify, the operating margin comment for the fourth quarter of operating margin expansion, that was a year-over-year comment in the fourth quarter, not a sequential?\nLawrence Kurzius: I think both.\nPeter Galbo: Both. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a broader question on the - just thinking about the cost savings for next year. I know we spent a lot of time talking about that. But just as we think about like repatriating production, surge capacity coming down, normalizing inventory levels. Like is there a way to quantify, I would imagine the there's probably a volume impact that comes with that. You'll get the benefit on the cost side, but maybe there's an offset a little bit, at least on topline on volume. Is there any way to quantify that at this point?\nLawrence Kurzius: No, I don't think that's what we're saying at all. And I think we've quantified the cost benefit, but I don't think that there's an impact on volume at all. I mean this is a normalization and that we went through this year. And I don't think that has an impact. Now of course, we kind of don't want to get into 2023 guidance. But whatever - that would all be reflected in whatever guidance we give for next year. And I do want to emphasize that we've spent a lot of time talking about supply chain in our remarks and on the Q&A here. But you know, I do want to be clear that what's the most important thing I'm glad you really brought this point up about volume, is that the continued growing demand for flavor and the strong growth of our business that we're fueling with executing on our strategies, and with our passionate and engaged employees is the most important thing. Inflation is a reality and our pricing has caught up with it, we're seeing that coming through in the margin sale, you can see it, you know, see us keep caught up and take the actions that are necessary. And then comes supply chain, that's really kind of the third most important thing, which is to eliminate the excessive costs and inefficiencies that have crept into the supply chain. So I do want to keep that in perspective, that growth is still at the top of the heap.\nPeter Galbo: Fair enough. Thanks very much guys.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor over to management for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great, thank you. McCormick's alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor in combination with the presence and reach for global portfolio and our strategic investments, provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We're disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long term strategies actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from a relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence. And thanks to everybody for joining today's call. If you have any further questions on today's information, please feel free to contact me. And this concludes this morning's call. Thank you, again.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Third quarter sales increased 3% from the year ago period as anticipated. In constant currency, sales grew 6%, reflecting 10% growth from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and 1% decline attributable to the exits of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia and a 2% decline in all other volume and product mix. Our underlying third quarter growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio as well as the effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, third quarter sales grew at a constant currency three-year compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, up 7%, reflecting the sustained momentum in our business across both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Moving to profit, adjusted operating income was down 12% or 11% in constant currency adjusted earnings per share was down 14%. During the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued and recovery of certain constrained materials is taking longer than expected. We continue to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in our Flavor Solutions segment. While in our Consumer segment, where demand moderated from elevated consumption trends more quickly than expected, we are experiencing lower-than-optimal operating leverage. Across the supply chain, we remain focused on managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies, though the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin and profit realization in the current period. Over the coming months, we will be aggressively eliminating supply chain inefficiencies. Importantly, as we had expected in the third quarter, our price increases are catching up with the pace of cost inflation in both segments. We began to recover the cost inflation that had been outpacing our pricing actions and other levers most significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect this will continue into the next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time. Before discussing our third quarter segment performance in more detail, I'd like to comment on our supply chain plan, starting on Slide 5. We have a focused plan in flight that leverages the discipline of our established Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI program to ensure that we are able to flexibly support customer demand, both where it has been sustained at higher levels and where it has moderated, while eliminating inefficiencies and normalizing both our cost structure and inventory levels. Our actions are well underway. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. There are areas of our business that have sustained high levels of demand for an extended period and our supply chain has been pressured to meet this demand. We have several initiatives in progress that will increase our capacity, strengthen our supply chain resiliency and importantly, enable us to service our customers so they can grow their business. For example, we're investing in additional Flavor Solutions seasoning capacity, which will be online in early 2023. We're expanding FONA's footprint to support our flavor growth. We recently opened our new U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility to support our strong growth momentum with quick service restaurants. And just earlier this week, the first pallet was shipped from our new Maryland Logistics Center. And from a cost perspective, as we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we have incurred additional costs above inflation to service our customers and have seen inefficiencies develop in our supply chain. These are costs we have absorbed. We have not passed into customers on our pricing actions. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs with a significant benefit in 2023. We're moving aggressively to take these costs and inefficiencies out as well as normalized inventory levels that have built up. Some of our actions include investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in bottleneck areas to enable better customer service and repatriation of production from excessive use of co-packers. We're returning to more normal ship schedules and reducing our spend on expensive surge capacity. We are already seeing the benefit of lower overtime and temporary labor reductions. In this more normalized environment as well as through customer collaboration, we are already beginning to reduce expedited freight costs and less-than-truckload shipping costs as well as other transportation inefficiencies. We are resolving raw material and packaging supply issues. For example, we are beyond the shortages of glass bottles and certain organic spices, which impacted supply of our U.S. gourmet line. A supplier facility closure announced in September drove the discontinuation of a component of our dry recipe mix packaging and through our quick qualification of alternative supply, we mitigated a major disruption during the fourth quarter. Long-running shortage of French's mustard bottle will be resolved in the first half of 2023 as new molds come online at a second supplier. And from an inventory perspective, we are also executing on plans to return to historical safety stock levels, which were raised to protect against supply disruption. We expect the impact of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs, increase our efficiency and ability to meet demand, lower our inventory levels and importantly, increase our profit realization beginning in the first half of 2023. We have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years with the peak disruption experienced in the third quarter of last year. Since then, there has been steady improvement building progress and bolstering our confidence in our plan to enhance our operational performance and optimize our cost structure. While we will always prioritize meeting our customers' needs, I'm encouraged by our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain. We've continued to define and quantify specific actions within our plans as we - since we shared we would be driving the elimination of the supply chain inefficiencies in our preannouncement last month. We look forward to sharing more details and progress with you in January, when we provide our 2023 outlook. Now moving to third quarter business update for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 6 and the status of our pricing actions, our third quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions, with an acceleration of effective pricing in the quarter versus the first half of the year, in line with what we expected. While broad pressure on Consumers' cost of lending from inflation, which heightened during our third quarter, has resulted in higher price elasticity than we originally anticipated, our elasticities remain lower than historical levels. And our most recent pricing actions, which in the U.S. took effect as we began our fourth quarter, we focused on areas that are less elastic and did not take pricing on some products where we had seen the highest elasticity. Now, for some further highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 4%, in line with our shipments. And over the last three years, since 2019, consumption has grown at a three-year CAGR of 8%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. In early August, we divested our Kitchen Basics business. We consistently grew this brand over the years but as it was the only U.S. brand we had in the stock and broth aisle our resources were better focused on core categories where we have leading brands. Demand has remained high with strong growth in the majority of our categories. Spices and seasonings has been one of our strongest categories in the past three years. And as a result, we are lapping all-time highs in consumption. This has created challenging comparisons in some product lines, such as baking related items, which have returned to a pre-pandemic level unlike most of our categories. Grilling-related items were impacted versus last year by high meat prices, although grilling is still strong versus pre-pandemic. Health conditions continue to improve as seen in our recipe mix share performance, with the fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured by service-related distribution losses, a shortage of certain packaging items as well as certain organic spices, which has largely been resolved and some trading down by consumers who remain under pressure from broad-based inflation. We are using our category and revenue management capabilities to strengthen our spices and seasoning presence on shelf. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution, which we're beginning to realize now. In EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance at herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We are continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K., and we are beginning to build momentum with Cholula as we expand that brand into this market. For the quarter and year-to-date versus last year, as well as since 2019, we are driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. Our Bottone brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line of unique to our EMEA region, as flows, we have seen baking return to a more pre-pandemic baseline level in EMEA to, again, unlike our other categories. Turning to the Asia Pacific region. Last year, the region experienced supply chain challenges such as ocean freight capacity constraints and lapping that impact contributed to growth in the third quarter. Additionally, following an extended lockdown in the second quarter, COVID resurgence in Shanghai and some other cities throughout China eased as we began the third quarter, resulting in trade and pantry replenishment contributing to growth. Recently, several cities in Central China, which is the primary market of our Wuhan operations, have experienced new COVID-related lockdowns and we are continually monitoring the situation. Overall, our China performance is on track with our expectations. Across all regions in our consumer segment, we are achieving the price realization we expected and we're executing on our proven growth strategies, pivoting action plans as needed based on our consumer insights and the environment. We continue to invest behind our brands. We increased brand marketing investments in the third quarter and have additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. In addition to our highly effective and inspiring holiday messaging, we have pivoted our digital messaging to emphasize value and show consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars without sacrificing flavor. We are focusing our innovation efforts to meet the needs of consumers concerned about their budgets. In the Americas, we have launched a new Lawry's branded opening price point range of every day 10 spices. And our large-size format Super Deal is one of the best-performing product lines as consumers are looking for greater value. This format size is approximately a 40% better value per ounce than the smaller sizes. We've also launched large-sized resealable pouches of top-selling items in markets across all regions. In terms of category management, we are collaborating with our customers to ensure the right assortment and price points on shelf to optimize category performance and increase profitability for our customers. And as always, we have a strong merchandising program planned for the holiday season. We are confident in our brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives, which will continue to drive strong growth. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 8. Our sales performance for the quarter was strong, with growth led by our pricing actions in all three regions with an increase in our effective pricing versus the first half of the year as we expected. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas, strong growth was driven by snack seasonings, savory flavors and branded foodservice products. Demand continues to strengthen the branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers as mobility and strong summer travel continued to fuel consumption. And importantly, we also are expanding distribution. In EMEA, growth remained strong across our entire customer base. Our third quarter growth was led by strong quick service restaurant, or QSR, momentum in all markets partially driven by expanded distribution and our customers' promotional activities. And we're seeing an acceleration of demand in branded foodservice as customers shift to more economical formats. Our full spectrum of solutions across price points is driving growth. We are winning in both regions with our new product momentum. In Americas, growth from new products contributed approximately 25% more growth in flavors in the third quarter than the year ago period, driven by beverage, savory snacks and Performance Nutrition flavors. We are continuing to win share in these categories. And in EMEA, our third quarter new product launches accelerated versus earlier in the year. And for the full year, we expect new product introductions to outpace 2021. We are fueling future growth. In APG, we're driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, winning new limited time offers as well as realizing growth from strong performance of their core menu items we flavor. In many cases, we are the heat in their spicy offerings. Overall, Flavor Solutions has remained strong and for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand. And as I said earlier, we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us, and we see light ahead. Now some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 9. Global demand for Flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio. We are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. Our solid track record of achieving our long-term objectives highlights the resiliency of our business through a variety of market conditions as well as our focus on sales growth and profit realization. The long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong, the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the global dynamic environment. The compounding benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth and balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. The teamwork of our McCormick employees, driver momentum and success and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. And now I will turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 26. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Our sales growth momentum is strong. Though challenges in our supply chain have taken longer to normalize, we have now passed an inflection point. We have begun to recover the cost inflation that has been outpacing our pricing actions while executing on a plan to aggressively eliminate supply chain costs, and we expect 2022 fourth operating margin expansion and continued improvement into 2023. Our long-term performance, including through periods of volatility and has been industry-leading and long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remains strong. We have a proven track record of execution and are confident we will successfully navigate this dynamic environment for our future sustainable growth and build long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to your questions. Hi. Good morning Ken. Well, I think that there's always some tension when you're talking about pricing and margins with customers. And so I don't want to get into anything with any one specific customer. But right now, all of our customers recognize that inflation is ongoing, and we continue to have, I'd say, productive pricing discussions with our customers. We just did take another round that is effective here at fourth quarter. And we're really not seeing that kind of push back right now. And I think particularly on the Flavor Solutions side of the business, we have - we still have more work to do. Well, first of all, all of this is incremental to our normal CCI program are using the processes and the organization Alpha Drives or CCI program to actually execute on these. This is incremental savings that we are and although some of the - you know I would characterize as a one-time take out the - it goes straight to run rate. These are incremental costs that we have incurred due to extensive search capacity, some of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks. So overtime, temporary labor and efficient shift, excessive use of CO-packers, a lot of premium transportation charges, we do expect to get that out of our system, get back to our pre-pandemic operating standards. And we would expect - while this is a one-time takeout, it goes straight to run rate. Yes. I think that stumble is the wrong way to characterize it. I think that we're a bit of a victim of our own success. We've won a lot of new business, and we prioritized keeping our customers in stock and supplying them. And that has put a lot of pressure on our supply chain in a few areas and we've got projects underway to address kind of a normalization of production and through capacity additions. Some of these wins are substantial, and we've had real brick-and-mortar projects that take a couple of years to put into place that are coming online right now and that are going to get at a lot of the extraordinary costs. There's some parts of our business, the 24/7 shifts that we've gotten out of most of our business, we're still doing that in a lot of our that's why I wouldn't say a lot in parts of our Flavor Solutions business, and that is a less efficient ship pattern even though it does get you some capacity to be an example of expensive surge capacity. But we've got new seasonings capacity coming online in the Americas, some of it now, so some of it in the first - early part of 2023. We're starting up a new flavor solutions plant in the U.K. We've got expanded distribution that that's shipping really starting to ship right now. And so I think that we've got a lot going for us in Flavor Solutions to support that strong growth in a more efficient way. As a margin issue on Flavor Solutions, partly is just the way our contractual arrangements work with our customers, there is a pass-through mechanism for the major raw materials that go into their products. There's a lag to it. In times when inflation was 1%, 2%, 3%, that lag really wasn't important. But this year, where it's been double-digit, it has been important. And we are going to catch that up. I was just going to say, Mike, one thing I would add there, Rob, is the composition and the profile of our business is so different to 2005. And this - our strategy to keep driving and evolving the business towards that higher value-added portfolio is what you're seeing in our business portfolio today. And so there's a very different, I think, set of conditions compared to the point you referenced. And we have done a lot of portfolio pruning behind the scenes as we - especially as we went through these last three years, where the extraordinary growth that we have in the parts of the business that we're focused on more than made up for parts of the business where we were getting out of low-margin high-touch businesses. And I think it's been a self-reinforcing strategy. The migration of our business more and more towards the value-added, technically insulated and flavor end of the spectrum has made our product wins stickier and our R&D teams more able to work on new business not focused on constantly re-winning bid business. Good morning. I'd rather describe it more in terms of our gross margin trajectory than to talk about pricing too specifically because I'm worried that it's going to get into things that might have set our customers. But you can see the margin trajectory on this business beginning to turn. We talked about an inflection point. Flavor Solutions margins have been ticking down through the second quarter of the year. They're turning - the year-on-year comparison has narrowed in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to narrow and begin a recovery as we go through next year. I would say - I mean, from a - you're always going to have some of these programs to say that. So, you're always going to have some of this, I think this year is kind of a high watermark that we should get some get in next year. But some of these programs take a bit of time to get fully, fully done. These are big programs. I mean the project we just shipped our first panel that's marked down out of our big Northeast distribution center, but we want to move over time into 2023. We'll be moving parts of our business into that. So, there'll be a bit of inefficiency there. But... Like I said, we've preannounced, we haven't closed our books yet. So these are all estimates and we felt pretty good where we landed. There was a couple of things. Tax came in a little bit more favorable at about penny, some other SG&A things came in a little bit more favorable, but nothing material... And right where we thought. We had a little bit more visibility on the sales versus profit and between Q3 and Q4, there's a little shift. Hi, good morning, Chris. How are you? Well, of course, it was a factor weighing on profit in the quarter end and has been all year. Again, every customer has got to sell different contractual arrangements. I think about a quarter lag is a good way to think about it. But remember, costs keep coming in. I mean we didn't just get cost inflation on January 1 and price for it. These costs have been steadily increasing all year, and in fact, continue to increase. The inflationary outlook has not settled. So there's been a bit of a - we've gotten - we've passed costs there, but there's been a bit of chasing it as new as costs have continued to go up. I'm going to let Brendan comment on this a little further. I think you've got - I'm going to try and unpack that in pieces. We have been guiding all year. And it - and you can see it coming through now and not just in our reported numbers, but also through the scanner. But we would have more pricing in effect in the second half of the year, especially going into the fourth quarter than we have - than we did in the early part of the year. We've - in the Americas this year, taken a number of rounds of pricing that included the most recent one being here right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And so there is more pricing in effect now about our consumer business primarily there. And so you can see that coming through now. And really, other than the contractual windows that we were just talking about in Flavor Solutions, we largely have our actions for this year in place and we're looking ahead to 2023 now. I think that in Asia, we've got one more round that goes into effect actually this month. But really, our 2022 actions are away. And I gave such a long answer to that, but I forgot the second part of your question, but I'm going to let Brendan answer it. Yes. And I would say that our supply situation on the consumer business going to holiday is the best it's been in the last several years. Good morning, Andrew. Right. Andrew, no one has asked that yet. So I'm glad that you did not only a very short time since we preannounced. And so we don't have a lot of new information on consumer behavior or on retailer behavior. I'll let Brendan give some color on that, and then I'll take it back. Yes. And Andrew, it isn't exactly what you've asked, but it gives - give me a chance to talk about this a little bit. I want to emphasize that we have in our offering items for every price point and every retailer strategy and category from the premium end all the way down to opening price points and private label. And we spent a fair bit of time talking about the consumer that's under pressure and rightly so, we are concerned about pressure on the consumer, especially, the consumers on the lower half of the income spectrum. And we want to make sure that our products are accessible and approachable, but gourmet and premium end of our business is still very strong. And sometimes those price gaps can be exaggerated. And Brendan mentioned large size and super deal. The Nielsen data is a pretty blunt instrument when it reports unit price. It doesn't catch the fact that some of these value packs are really big and carry a high price point. If you adjust that out, the lower size packs that are growing strongly for us and that price gap actually narrows quite a bit. So I will start with the caveat that we're not going to give any guidance for 2023. Right now, I've got - everyone is standing around here with - holding their breath - if I'm going to say something rash about that. But - so it is a bit early for that. And I appreciate saying confidence in the investment community that's reflected in those consensus outlook. But there are some big puts and takes. I'm going to let Mike talk about those. And frankly, incentive comp has to be rebuilt. You know, certainly the pick of the part of it that was weak. We had strong performance on Flavor Solutions in that segment across the globe and really all segments. I'm sorry, I'll that's not to say all regions and all of the pieces of it. Well, maybe a little bit out maybe we did talk about a month ago. I mean some of the challenges on Flavor Solutions this year were cost related to plaque constraints. We could have sold more. We could have had higher volumes than you noted. So, I think from that perspective, some of the actions we've talked about it more capacity will help. But the demand is very strong and is very strong. Yes. We had enormous price [indiscernible] 10% pricing, we feel pretty good about. I think both. No, I don't think that's what we're saying at all. And I think we've quantified the cost benefit, but I don't think that there's an impact on volume at all. I mean this is a normalization and that we went through this year. And I don't think that has an impact. Now of course, we kind of don't want to get into 2023 guidance. But whatever - that would all be reflected in whatever guidance we give for next year. And I do want to emphasize that we've spent a lot of time talking about supply chain in our remarks and on the Q&A here. But you know, I do want to be clear that what's the most important thing I'm glad you really brought this point up about volume, is that the continued growing demand for flavor and the strong growth of our business that we're fueling with executing on our strategies, and with our passionate and engaged employees is the most important thing. Inflation is a reality and our pricing has caught up with it, we're seeing that coming through in the margin sale, you can see it, you know, see us keep caught up and take the actions that are necessary. And then comes supply chain, that's really kind of the third most important thing, which is to eliminate the excessive costs and inefficiencies that have crept into the supply chain. So I do want to keep that in perspective, that growth is still at the top of the heap. Thanks. Great, thank you. McCormick's alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor in combination with the presence and reach for global portfolio and our strategic investments, provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We're disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long term strategies actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from a relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long term value for our shareholders."

            "content": "Well, it's true. I think just the thing I would key in on is there is unlike, let's say, our consumer and our Flavors - our branded foodservice business, there's not sort of one moment in time where that pricing is, therefore, effective in the business. And so that's another way to maybe think about it, Chris. And I think just to build on part of your question, certainly, supply chain, as we've been talking about quite a bit in the prepared remarks, we're certainly an influence on how we're looking at that. So I think where you were going was just looking for some context around promotional spending. And I think the context we would provide is as we go into the holiday, we feel really good about our supply. We have a strong program planned for the holiday season as we would every year. But it certainly feels, I think, a little bit more robust now compared to, let's say, 2021 and 2020 just because we're in a better situation from the standpoint of the overall context in the market. So, we are turning back on promotions where we feel really confident about supply, and we're looking at the holiday season that way. Those choices are not necessarily connected to any pricing decisions we're making in the market, but really to support of the business. And helping to drive the category for our retailers. Yes, I think, Andrew, things are largely consistent with what we had discussed or shared broadly within the last four weeks. So, we haven't really seen a lot of new information or data. They seem this price gap seem to be kind of holding in the very same range that we talked about before. And - but we still are a leading supplier of private label into the category and we're passing those price increases along to customers just as we have on branded products and that's a retailer-by-retailer decision, I think, on what gets realized itself. But in the meanwhile, we're still driving a lot of that value programming that we had talked about whether it's not only our messaging, but also we're seeing a lot of lift in some of those parts of our portfolio that tend to drive more value. We offer - our offerings are really across the spectrum that would meet consumers' needs. And we're seeing growth on the premium end, we're seeing growth on the value end. In parts of our business like Gourmet Garden, which tend to be on the premium end, are actually doing really well in this context. And then we see our value sizes like super deal performing very strongly, also off shelf and in the market. And then we're introducing more value into the market through this opening price point worries program. And we're also doing that in other parts of our - in other markets around the world where we're - and many of them were launching re-sealable pouches that are larger than usual and allow consumers to kind of realize more value that way. But that's probably the added context I would share since the last month."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 12. Our top line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, including a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India, and the consumer business in Russia. In our Consumer segment, we drove constant currency sales growth of 4%, with 10% related to pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as lower volume. With the exit of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia contributing a combined 1% impact due to the lower volume. On a three-year basis, our third quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 6%. On Slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by a decline in volume as well as a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. As Lawrence mentioned, the volume decline was impacted not only by elasticities, but also by constrained supply of certain input materials, primarily packaging items. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 6%. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 1%, which included a 3% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Growth in other markets were driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume, with the most significant volume impact attributable to lower sales of Vahine Hommade dessert products. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 10%, including a 7% unfavorable impact from the exit of low-margin business in India. As Lawrence mentioned, growth was driven by higher volume, mainly attributable to trade and pantry replenishments in China, following the extended Shanghai lockdown last quarter, as well as the region lapping supply chain challenges in the year ago period. Pricing actions in all markets across the region also contributed to growth. On a three-year basis, APZ's third quarter constant currency sales grew at a 4% CAGR. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and Slide 16. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 10%, primarily due to pricing actions, with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth. Third quarter constant currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% CAGR. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 10%, driven by pricing. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%. In EMEA, we drove 11% constant currency sales growth, with 7% related to price actions and 4% volume and mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to lower sales in Russia, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR, branded foodservice and packaged food and beverage company customers. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales growth was 9% CAGR. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, in part due to the timing of the promotional activities. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 6% CAGR over the past three years. As seen on Slide 20, adjusted gross profit margin declined 320 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period. Let me spend a moment on the significant drivers. First, almost 80% of this decline, approximately 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, I'll cover the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margin. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand for certain parts of that business. And there has also been an unfavorable impact from the start-up and dual running costs as we transition production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. In our Consumer segment, where demand has moderated more quickly than we expected, we are experiencing lower operating leverage. Overall, while the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected pressure in gross margin, we are taking actions to normalize our costs, as Lawrence mentioned, which we are confident will be reflected in our 2023 gross margin. Partially offsetting these impacts I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings, where we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. And finally, of note, in line with our expectations, the impact of our pricing actions in the third quarter began outpacing cost inflation in both segments, more significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect pricing to continue outpacing inflation into next year, as we plan to fully offset inflation over time. Overall, our cost recovery and gross margin improvement will vary by region and segment, with a slower Flavor Solutions recovery. Importantly, though, we have now passed the inflection point with significant gross margin improvement since last quarter, driven by our consumer segment performance, and, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter. Now moving to Slide 21. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the third quarter of last year with higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments, offset by lower employee benefit expenses. As a percent of net sales, SG&A declined 60 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 1% in constant currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, a decline of 34%. Turning to income taxes on Slide 22. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 14.1% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 23, third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.80 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. A favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio in the third quarter was fully offset by the impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year. On Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and a quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $250 million through the third quarter of 2022, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $298 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $167 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. While our fourth quarter has historically generated our highest cash flow from operations, based on our current profit outlook and working capital position, we do not expect to delever to our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With our improving gross margin as well as our plan to normalize our supply chain cost and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 25. We are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by cost inflation and supply chain challenges. We also expect there will be a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 3% to 5%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by price elasticities, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels given our focused approach led by consumer insights. Our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business. The demand disruptions experienced in China and the exit of our consumer business in Russia as well as continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 350 to 300 basis points lower than 2021, primarily driven by our Flavor Solutions segment. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment this year, cost inflation outpaced pricing in the first half of the year. We expect pricing to outpace inflation in the second half of the year and continue into next year. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, higher supply chain costs, lower operating leverage and unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we have priced to offset dollar cost increases. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect our adjusted operating income to decline 11% to 9% in constant currency. In addition to our gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost - total cost savings target of approximately $85 million and a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments compared to 2021. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68 as compared to $3.05 in 2021. This projection includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Kitchen Basics business. As we currently progress in our fourth quarter, we are confident in delivering our 2022 outlook, continuing our strong top line growth trajectory and as our guidance implies, delivering fourth quarter operating margin expansion while executing on a focused plan to drive improvement in our cost structure. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs or approximately a 150 basis point impact to our operating margin. With our proven track record of delivering CCI-led savings to fuel growth investments and expand our operating margin, we are leveraging the discipline of the CCI program to aggressively eliminate costs and inefficiencies. Overall, we are confident our focus on profit realization will drive margin improvement. And while parts of our plan to optimize our cost structure, will take longer than others, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of our actions in the first half of 2023. We look forward to sharing more details on progress with you in January when we provide our 2023 outlook. I think the reality, Ken, is we're still recovering. Our pace of pricing has caught up now with cost and we say, we'll recover dollar to dollar in 2023. But there is a trend that is going in the right direction. And obviously, as we look at 2023, we look at what's the cost environment, things like that, we need to go again next year, but that's still - I think remember, we've talked about this before, over half of the dilution this year is due to the cost versus pricing. So that's just the math that we'll get back over time. Also, these projects, Lawrence mentioned, there's a lot of double running costs as we bring those big projects up like U.K., Peterborough that eventually will go away. So that will help the margins, too. To your point, though, about - are we spread too thin? I actually have to flavor division back in 2005 when that was identified, there's no comparison to today. It's really focus and Lawrence, why don't you... I would say - I wouldn't - I think the bigger bucket is actually some of the excess costs that we've talked about, and which actually would have driven more sales if we could have supplied it. But the excess cost that we - for the reason we called down our preannouncement was we haven't been able to get those out of the system yet. Yeah, pricing is a bit behind, I mean, the thing that gives us the comfort that we're going to recover more margin Flavor Solutions is because we've seen it in Consumer. The Consumer is turning positive from a gross margin and an operating profit perspective as pricing wave comes through, and you'll see the same in Flavor Solutions. But I don't have the exact number for you. Good morning. Yes. I think from a dollar perspective, like I said before, for both Consumer and Flavor Solutions business, we will catch up on the cost next year. We just took branded foodservice, that's supported labor solutions along with our consumer business at the beginning of the quarter, that will be a positive going into next year rapidly. So yes, there's no like one thing bag you catch up. It's over time, but in 2023, we will catch up. And I want to just emphasize that the things that we talked about on the call in terms of getting out the - on our prepared remarks in terms of getting at the cost for example. So, I don't want to overly focus on any one particular thing and give it too much weight. We were sharing examples and when we next report in January, we'll be able to give some progress updates on those exact examples as well as for other actions. Yes. I mean when we preannounced it was say - Hi. Yes. Obviously, a big wild part for next year is the inflation environment. So we're in the process now actually rolling up budgets and things like that, taking a look that drives pricing actions. Obviously, some of the other puts and takes you think about interest expense. Obviously, some of the actions we took this year might be a negative for next year. This cost pro we talked about, which we're going to give you a lot more detail in January. So I'd say, right now, there's so many big moving parts, it would be hard even to give you any guidance about. Right. Yes. I mean, SG&A, you're right, it's going to be down in the quarter, and it's primarily driven by the incentive comp. We're also getting higher fixed cost leverage, too, as you think about it, but - yes. I mean we adjust incentive comp every quarter, so I wouldn't take one quarter to then try to extrapolate the next year."

        "content": "Kasey Jenkins: Good morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's second quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to start by welcoming Brendan to this morning's call. In addition to his continuing role as President of our Global Consumer business, Brendan now has responsibility for our business worldwide in his newly appointed role as President and COO. At the end of our prepared remarks, I may ask him to weigh in on some of your questions. McCormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other volatility has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our financial objectives. Broadly, our results in the second quarter were in line with our sales and profit expectations despite certain global challenges, including a greater-than-expected level of high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruption in China from COVID-related lockdowns and the conflict in Ukraine. As our second quarter progressed, the dynamics of these conditions intensified and negatively impacted our sales and profit results. Before discussing our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to comment on each of these, starting on Page 5. Consistent with the rest of the industry, high cost inflation and supply chain are continuing challenges. To partially offset cost pressures, we've taken multiple pricing actions and, as planned, we are raising prices again. Inflation continued to escalate, and we've adjusted our upcoming pricing actions accordingly. We appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and reducing discretionary spend where possible. We expect our pricing actions and other levers to begin to outpace cost pressures late in the third quarter, with higher cost and higher offsetting pricing actions than we expected on our last call, which further weights our 2022 profit to the second half of the year. We plan to fully offset cost pressures over time. In China, during the second quarter, there was significant unanticipated disruption in consumption due to severe COVID-related lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities throughout China. China is our second biggest sales country, with operations in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan. Our Shanghai operation produces approximately 40% of our total China sales, which are distributed throughout the country and supports both of our segments. And as a reminder, our branded food service demand is included in our Consumer segment in China. The lockdowns lasted roughly 75 days, with our Shanghai plant forced to close for two weeks at the onset, with employees living in the facility. Once we were able to reopen, we were impacted by lockdown-related labor shortages due to workers being quarantined. During April and May, we incurred significant incremental manufacturing and transportation costs to supply our customers. In addition, as restaurants largely closed and consumers unable to shop for extended periods in our strongest geographies, we experienced significant demand softness as well. Market conditions in China have also allowed very little opportunity to increase prices. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China, but we will not be able to recover the sales and profit impact we experienced in this fiscal year. Finally, regarding the conflict in Ukraine, in mid-March, we suspended operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine were paused. These countries account for less than 1% of our overall business. We have recently decided to exit our Consumer business in Russia. Now for more detail on our second quarter results, starting with sales on Slide 7. Sales declined 1% from the second quarter of last year, including an unfavorable impact from currency. Our constant currency sales were comparable to last year, with growth from pricing actions offset by a decline in volume and product mix. The volume decline was impacted unfavorably by several discrete items, including a 1% impact from the China consumption disruption and the conflict in Ukraine I just mentioned, a 1% impact from the exit of low-margin business in India and a 2% impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment during last year's second quarter. Excluding these items, our sales performance would have been 4% growth, reflecting the strength of our broad global portfolio and effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions. While growth in both segments was impacted by the discrete items, they were more impactful to our Consumer segment. Notably, our growth in Flavor Solutions was outstanding. Comparisons to 2021 and 2020 remain difficult due to the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the second quarter of the last two years. Using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, second quarter sales have grown at a constant currency compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6%. Moving to profit. Adjusted operating income was down 33% or 32% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share was down 30%. The adjusted operating income comparison includes 7% unfavorable impact from the disruption to China's consumption and the conflict in Ukraine. Although we anticipated the profit driven by sales growth in the second quarter would be more than offset by higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, the impact was greater than expected due to continuing cost escalation. While this pressured second quarter profit, we expect to mitigate this impact later this year. Now moving to second quarter business updates for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 9, our second quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions. In the Americas, our first wave of pricing was phased in during our fourth quarter of last year, the second wave during the second quarter in April, and the third wave will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. With the first wave, we saw a very low level of elasticity. With the second wave, we are seeing more price elasticity, although still below historical levels. While consumer spending has remained strong, consumers are now under significant pressure for broad-based inflation, notably fuel prices and other macro factors. As we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. Overall, our pricing actions in EMEA and APZ are on track and our elasticity impacts are similar to the Americas. In EMEA and APZ, pricing timing varies by market within each region. In some markets, particularly in EMEA, there are regulatory guidelines on when we take pricing, which generally creates a lag in the timing of pricing compared to the Americas. In this unprecedented environment, however, we are taking additional action in markets across the EMEA. Now for some further highlights by region, starting Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%. And over the last three years, since 2019, consumption has grown at a three-year CAGR of 7%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. In the Americas, a sales decline in the second quarter included the impact of lapping a 4% over-shipment of consumption to replenish retailer inventories in the second quarter of last year. Our second quarter shipments this year were in line with our consumption change. Demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. However, some products remain stressed by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance of another quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured during the quarter by the shortage of certain packaging materials as well as certain organic spices. Some of these have been resolved and some will remain ongoing. We continue to use our category and revenue management capability to strengthen our spices and seasoning portfolio and optimize the category performance for both McCormick and our retailers. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we will begin to realize later this year. In EMEA, we continue to have strong share performance in most categories and markets. During the second quarter, we lapped strong year-ago consumption, partially due to last year's COVID-related restrictions throughout EMEA, where restrictions extended longer than other regions. Our Vahine brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line unique to our EMEA region, was most impacted as recently we've seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level. In other categories in the region, we believe there has been a step-up in consumption. And in the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to the consumption disruption in China, second quarter growth was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India. At the end of last year, we decided to exit our rice business, the Kohinoor brand, to enable the region to focus on our higher-margin core category. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our sales performance for the quarter was outstanding, with both pricing and volume growth contributing. We drove double-digit growth in both the at-home and away-from-home parts of our portfolio. Looking at our Flavor Solutions growth over the past three years, since the COVID-19 restrictions caused dramatic second quarter comparisons in '20 and '21, our sales CAGR is 8%, largely driven by volumes. Our pricing actions increased sales in all three regions. Broadly, pricing actions in the branded foodservice part of our portfolio followed the same cadence as those in each region in Consumer business. In the rest of our Flavor Solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows, with automatic price adjusters in many contracts and the timing is going to vary based on those windows. In this dynamic environment though, with costs escalating so quickly, we are having discussions outside of those windows and passing costs through faster than usual. Higher volumes also contributed to growth in the Americas and EMEA region. Demand has remained strong for certain parts of our business in these regions. Our supply chain is being pressured to meet this demand and we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us through this pressure. In the Americas, where our customer base is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, our at-home customers, strong growth was driven by flavors for savory snacks as well as performance nutrition and health applications with these customers. In EMEA, our customer base is more skewed to quick service restaurants or QSRs, and our strong QSR momentum contributed to growth in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution. Branded foodservice growth was strong in both the Americas and EMEA regions, driven by restaurant and institutional food service customers. Demand continues to strengthen in this channel, particularly as travel accelerates and restaurants benefit from consumers shifting to take-away and delivery. Overall, our Flavor Solutions sales demand and growth momentum continues to be strong. Now let me expand on our growth platform and positioning in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, but the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste, with the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor. We continue to make investments to sustainably meet the growing demand and to fuel further growth. In our global supply chain, we increased our capacity with our recently opened U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility and have begun our expansion of FONA's footprint to support future flavor growth. We are also increasing our capacity in the fast-growing hot-sauce category and investing in seasoning capacity to support increased demand and strengthen resiliency. As we've said, with the sustained level of high consumer demand, we're benefiting from the manufacturing capacity we've added. While we still experienced disruptions in the supply chain, they are much more specific mainly from a transportation and packaging supply standpoint. We experienced the peak disruption in the third quarter of last year. And with every month, the supply chain continues to get better, we feel good about the progress we're making. We are strategically investing behind our brands to drive growth, including in brand marketing, as we did throughout the pandemic with our three-year brand marketing CAGR approximating our consumer segment sales CAGR for the same period. We're pivoting our messaging to emphasize to consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollar. For instance, we're launching a digital messaging highlighting the value of our product by making a great flavorful meal economically. We add flavor for only pennies per serving and recipes like our 30-minute Taco Casserole are family and budget-friendly answers to what's for dinner. We continue to invest in new products. In our Consumer segment, we are responding to new consumer behaviors, like increased at-home lunches. For instance, our new patent pending French's Creamy Mustard is off to a great start. We're sensitive to the needs of price-conscious consumers, not just in these challenging economic times, but every day. Our portfolio includes branded items to accommodate consumers' needs and provide solutions for everyone at every price point as well as private label products. Our new product launches include additional entry-level price point product for affordability and larger sizes of key high usage items for better value. While we are still seeing strong consumer spending, we know that inflation is a significant concern for consumers, more so than COVID. We're leveraging our proprietary research, which served us well during the pandemic, to monitor for any signals of changing behavior. Our research continues to indicate consumers are going to cook as much at home or more than they did during the pandemic for many reasons. One of them is that they find it more economical. To the extent there is a recession, it further reinforces cooking at home, and we know from our past sales performance that our categories and brands perform well during a recessionary period. Now for some summary comments on Slide 13 before turning it over to Mike. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years regardless of the environment, the long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. The strength of our business value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly gives us confidence, in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate a challenging global environment. Despite the pressures we experienced in the second quarter, we are well positioned and confident in delivering strong performance in 2022 and beyond, while driving sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. Their agility and their teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. And now, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 15. Our top line constant currency sales were comparable to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 7% growth from pricing actions, offset by a 7% decline in volume and product mix. Excluding the 4% impact of the discrete item Lawrence mentioned earlier, our sales performance would have reflected 4% growth. Consumer segment sales declined 7% in constant currency. The impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment, the consumption disruption in China, the exit of low-margin business in India and the conflict in the Ukraine contributed 6% to that decline. The remaining 1% decline was due to lower volume, partially offset by pricing actions. On a three-year basis, our second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 4%. On Slide 16, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and mix, partially offset by pricing actions. This decline is attributable to lapping trade inventory replenishments in the second quarter of last year. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 7%. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 11%, primarily due to lapping high year-ago demand driven by COVID-related lockdowns, the most significant impact of which was lower sales of Vahine homemade dessert products. A 1% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia and Ukraine also contributed to the decline. Pricing actions in all markets partially offset the lower volume. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 18%, including a 20% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low-margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. On a three-year basis, APZ's second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was a 7% decline, driven by the China and India impact I just mentioned. Excluding this impact, sales grew at a 5% CAGR over the past three years. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 19. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 11% due to pricing actions as well as higher volume and mix. This growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in sales related to the combined impact of the China disruption and the conflict in Ukraine. Second quarter constant currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% CAGR. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales grew 12%, driven by both pricing and the combination of volume and mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth, with higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing to growth. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%. In EMEA, we drove 19% constant currency sales growth with a 14% increase in volume and mix and 5% related to pricing actions. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to the conflict in Ukraine, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and branded foodservice customers. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 10% CAGR. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales declined 6% in constant currency. The decline was driven by a 7% impact from lower volume in China due to the COVID-related restrictions, partially offset by pricing actions in all markets across the region. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 3% CAGR over the past three years. As seen on Slide 23, adjusted gross profit margin declined 550 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Realizing this is a sizable compression, I will spend a moment on the significant drivers. Let me start with the drivers we anticipated. First, nearly half of this decline, approximately 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This impact was more significant than in the first quarter because of the higher level of pricing in the second quarter. Product mix was unfavorable as compared to the second quarter of last year. In our Consumer segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are lapping strong U.S. spices and seasonings growth related to the inventory replenishment. In our Flavor Solutions segment, sales growth in our away-from-home products was higher than our at-home products and we are lapping strong sales of beverage flavors last year. A sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by start-up and dual running costs as we transitioned production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. Of note, CCI-led cost savings partially offset the impacts I just walked through and we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. In addition to the net impact of the anticipated items I just detailed, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by the following items: As Lawrence discussed, cost inflation and supply chain pressures escalated during the second quarter impacting our results more than expected, primarily related to transportation costs and faster-turning materials. While we have adjusted our upcoming pricing actions to reflect that escalation and we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time, our second quarter gross margin compression reflects the usual lag associated with pricing. We expect pricing to begin outpacing the cost pressures later this year and continue into next year. Our cost recovery will vary by region and segment. Currently, our pricing lag is more significant in our Flavor Solutions segment. Lawrence previously mentioned we have incremental costs to meet strong demand for certain parts of our Flavor Solutions business, thus impacting our gross margin. And finally, as already mentioned, significant cost due to the COVID-related restrictions in China had an unfavorable impact to profit. Moving to Slide 24. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower than the second quarter of last year and as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points. The decline was driven by lower employee benefit and brand marketing expenses as well as discretionary spending reductions, partially offset by higher distribution costs. The decline in brand marketing investments was driven by China and Russia reductions. Importantly, across our other markets, we invested in brand marketing at a comparable level to last year. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 29%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 40%. A 1% unfavorable impact from currency is included in each of these declines. Turning to income taxes on Slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6% compared to 22.2% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. At the bottom line, please turn on Slide 26, second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. On Slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $154 million through the second quarter of 2022 compared to $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income. Cash flow from operations will be weighted to the second half of the year, similar to our profit growth. We returned $198 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $102 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 28. As a reminder, last quarter, the conditions in Russia, Ukraine and China were just unfolding and cost inflation and supply chain challenges remain dynamic and fast moving. Today, we have a better view of the macro environment and our guidance for the full year considers the greater impact from these items. In addition, and as noted previously, we have always expected our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We now expect it to be even more so. We are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by the global challenges I just mentioned. We also expect there will be an estimated two-percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, an increase from our previous estimate of one-percentage point unfavorable. On the top line, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing, which will accelerate significantly in the second half versus the first half. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by increasing elasticity, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio as well as the impact of demand disruptions in China and Ukraine. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. We are now projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 200 basis points to 150 basis points lower than 2021. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment, cost pressures have outpaced our pricing and future actions have been adjusted to reflect the higher cost level. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impacts from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We now expect to grow our adjusted operating income 2% to 4% in constant currency. In addition to the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million and brand marketing investments comparable to 2021 which reflects reductions in China and Russia. Considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items as well as our estimated mix of earnings by geography, we now project our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%. We are lowering our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations to a range of $3.03 to $3.08. This compares to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and represents a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% or in constant currency, growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and an expected $15 million benefit from the impact of optimizing our debt portfolio. In addition, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue our operating momentum and drive another year of strong performance.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 29. Our long-term performance has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our objectives, including through volatile environments. The long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remained strong. Several discrete items unfavorably impact our sales comparison to the second quarter of last year. Excluding these impacts, our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, the effective execution of our strategies and our pricing actions. Our sales growth momentum is strong. Persistent high cost inflation and supply chain challenges intensified as the second quarter progressed and unfavorably impacted our profit. Importantly, we expect to mitigate this impact in the second half of the year. We're confident that with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and our ability to navigate challenging environments, we will drive another year of strong performance in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: I guess, first off, as you talked about, organic sales came in below where The Street was looking for it, though you raised the outlook for organic for the full year. And I appreciate some of the items in 2Q you highlighted were discrete. But maybe you could talk a little bit about, what gives you the confidence in raising the organic guidance for the full year? Are you expecting headwinds in 2Q to become tailwinds in the second half or better momentum in the underlying business? The scanner data has not necessarily showed any meaningful inflection yet that I can see at least on a year-over-year basis. I appreciate the multiyear CAGR of organic sales. So, I'm trying to get a better sense for the underlying confidence in raising the full year organic to start with.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Andrew. Well, first of all, our plan, as we shared on previous calls and conferences, has always been back half-loaded and stronger in the second half than in the first half. And one of the factors driving that is the cadence of our pricing actions. There is twice as much effective pricing in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year. As you can see, right now, for the quarter, our pricing contribution to sales was about 7% and it's significantly higher going into the second half of the year. And that is a big driver of total sales build third quarter, fourth quarter. And that's -- I mean that's the driver of sales. It's also the driver on the operating profit, EPS and so on as we go through. The second thing is that we did not expect the disruption that we had in China in the second quarter. The extent of the lockdown was a surprise to us and I think to everybody. And China is a big contributor to us and we expect a normalization of business in China as we go through the second half. Particularly, we really expect it to be normal by the time we get to fourth quarter. And just our experience with the initial COVID lockdown a couple of years ago tells us that once we get normalization, there's a significant surge in restocking by both the consumer and by our trade channels. And so, we would expect a strong contribution from China in the second half of the year. And then finally, our U.S. and EMEA have less difficult comparisons going in through the second half than they did in the first half of the year, not lapping inventory replenishment that we talked about last year and also not lapping some of the COVID lockdowns that were still in effect, particularly in the second quarter. And finally, we expect continued strong underlying demand from our consumers and our customers that we're continuing to see. Mike, do you have anything you want to add to that? Do you want to add something?\nMike Smith: Yes. I think I'd add that we see a lot of strength in our Flavor Solutions business. We saw that in the second quarter and we know that will continue in the second half. So we certainly think that's going to support, I think, really our outlook for the second half overall. But also we're seeing a lot of new business come through in the back half of the year in both segments. And so we see a lot of strength coming through on that, too. So, the growth again does look even stronger as we move towards the back half.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. And then just a quick follow-up. I don't think you mentioned it, I know you did last quarter when you were talking about in the core consumer business, private label, had not yet really had much of a move one way or the other. I don't think you mentioned it this time around. I'm just curious what you're seeing there. Anything of note that we should be aware of?\nLawrence Kurzius: I don't think that there's anything of special note there. We are seeing some trade held by consumers, not just in our category but in other categories that we track. It's no surprise that consumers at the lower end of the income scale particularly are feeling a bit of pressure from inflation, not ours, but inflation across everything. I mean, gas prices are $5 or $6 a gallon, depending on where you live, and that puts pressure on consumers' pocketbook. But I would say that it's still at a pretty low level, particularly when we look at our brands and the elasticity that we're experiencing, it's still significantly below historical levels and it's not a particular concern. I'd say also, I'll add to that, our sales with private label products are certainly an important part of our business but not particularly surging.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: I just wanted to make sure I heard your commentary about pricing correctly and then I'm doing some basic math, right? You did about, I think, 6% pricing in the first half. You're saying that will double in the second half. And you also, I think, are implying that you need around 10% organic sales growth in the second half to hit your guide. Sorry to do the math on the call, I apologize for putting you on the spot, but are you effectively saying that it's reasonable for us to model maybe 12% pricing overall in the second half with volume maybe down around 2%? Is that  here?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, Ken, let me start with that. I'm going to let Mike point in on that. But I think you're in the right neighborhood with those numbers. We took -- first, when I think about the cadence of our increases and the timing of their effectiveness, you're in the right neighborhood when you think about going from 6% to 12% in the second half. I would have that -- again, our next pricing action in the Americas, our largest region, is in August. And so if you're thinking about phasing that, you should have that in mind as well.\nMike Smith: I'd also just add, you're going to see it across both Consumer and Flavor Solutions pretty much at the same level.\nKen Goldman: Great. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. It sounds like you mentioned pricing will kind of phase in a little bit over the second half. In this context and given some of the other factors you talked about, how do we think about the cadence of the gross margin improvement in the back half? Should we expect a substantial improvement in 3Q? Is it more 4Q-weighted? Maybe any color you could provide there would be helpful as we think about modeling.\nMike Smith: Ken, this is Mike. That's a great question. We see -- actually, the cost peak year-on-year we see is third quarter and a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter. We see the pricing obviously growing second to third to fourth. So I think what you'll see is some -- still some gross margin challenges in the third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, the combination impact of that pricing and full benefit there and the cost. And also think about the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter overall from a volume perspective there. And as Lawrence said before, things like China, which we make really the margin on, as that recovers from third into fourth, too, that should be a positive for 4Q.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. So you gave a good deal of bottoms-up color on the incremental headwinds facing the business. So I think I'm clear on that. But I just want to play it back from the top down. Because your overall sales outlook hasn't really changed despite the more adverse currency. You're now expecting a marginally lower tax rate, a marginally lower share count, slightly less brand marketing. And while the expected cost inflation is higher at the high-teens level, it's not outside the balance of the prior outlook. So I guess just -- I just want to isolate and see if you could better define what is exactly driving the reduced operating profit and EPS outlook. It feels like it's the updated outlook on China, Russia, Ukraine and supply conditions above and beyond the normal cost inflation. But I just want to -- I want to confirm that. And if there's a way to quantify or rank order those factors, that would be great.\nLawrence Kurzius: Steve, this is Lawrence. And I think that you -- some of the little things that I think we're going to want to come back and talk about some of those marginal changes that you talked about. But on the big picture item, you've got it exactly right. And in fact, this was part of what we were trying to message at your recent conference. The big change here are the things that were external factors that surprised us and that is what's flowing through.  I'll let Mike walk through the actual fringe on that. But --\nMike Smith: Yes. If you think about our guidance, we're coming down $0.14. If you think about from a China, Russia, Ukraine perspective, that's $0.11 right there. And then FX, as you said, we're going up 1%, that's $0.03. So there's your $0.14. Now we're recognizing that the cost inflation which you mentioned, we had mid to high double digit, we actually moved that to high double digit. So 1% to 2% more cost during the year driven by transportation, packaging, things like that. So that did hurt us in the second quarter. However -- and we're dropping a bit of that through the rest of the year, we have pricing to help mitigate that. And then below the line, some of the things you talked about, tax is a little bit of a help. Some of the interest expense things are going to help offset that. But the big drivers of the external factors -- the one thing I wanted to just correct you on brand or just to give you insight, brand marketing is now flat. However, that is really driven by the reduction in China, Russia, Ukraine and FX. So we're still spending up in our big markets to drive growth.\nSteve Powers: Okay. That's helpful. Yes, that's perfect. That's perfect. Just a quick follow-up. On the -- to follow up on, I think, Ken's question, just the cadence of gross margin recovery. Is there anything that you would call out in the second quarter as truly transitory? So is there anything that -- any headwind that you experienced in the second quarter that is kind of unique and discrete to the second quarter that doesn't carry over, at least directionally? Trying to get a sense if there's anything behind you.\nMike Smith: The one thing I'd say, and you're new to our business, but the China business to us is very material. It's our second biggest market. We have three large manufacturing facilities. And the shutdown really put a lot of pressure on our cost there, a lot of extra cost for transportation, loss absorption, things like that. So as that business recovers, obviously, that goes away. I think the other thing, too, is if you think about some of these costs that came up rapidly like transportation and packaging. I mean, fuel cost, if you go back to March, gasoline prices in the quarter versus March were up 25%. That stuff rolls through the P&L very quickly. And pricing will catch up on that, but a one-month lag in pricing could be $30 million to $40 million of impact, which is like $0.10 a share. So we're mitigating that as quickly as we can, but sometimes we see that as kind of stabilizing now. And going forward, like I told you, the third and fourth quarter, where we see our cost outlook. But I think that is -- to your point about what is transitory, what is not, I think that gets the most of it.\nLawrence Kurzius: And Steve, I would really underscore that timing aspect. A one-month difference on the effective date of our price increase, we would be having a different conversation. It would be $0.11, $0.12 of EPS on the quarter. And -- and of course, those price increases are in effect I would just say they  one month earlier. That's what the difference would have been. That's one reason why we're pretty confident that the -- that we're going to catch up with the cost.\nSteve Powers: Understood. I just want to play back just real quick Mike's point on China. I get it that China was uniquely detrimental to 2Q, but I don't think you're saying that, that's 100% transitory. That doesn't -- as of June 1, that's not behind you, right? That -- it gets better, but it's not --\nMike Smith: So that's why I said that's going to really help us in the fourth quarter more. It's still -- different levels of openings that are happening now, that will happen throughout the quarter, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Lawrence, in your opening remarks, you said that your research shows that there's -- that consumers will continue to cook as much at home as they did during the pandemic, if not more. And just anecdotally, I find that this year, that's not the case. People are regaining mobility, returning to the workforce, what have you. And you can see it in your numbers, too. So do you have any like kind of real-time insight into how consumers are behaving this year in light of the fact that your category in the U.S., it's much weaker than other packaged foods categories have been tracking.\nLawrence Kurzius: Brendan, I'm going to let you take that one.\nBrendan Foley: Yes, sure. Rob, we're -- I guess, just to react to some of the thoughts you just shared there. We're seeing through a lot of our research, also what we're seeing in secondary research out there, is that there's still a heavy level of sustained cooking at home in the data overall, whether we're researching it or we're getting it from some of our suppliers there. We definitely see a sustained level of eating at home. And overall, I would say that the consumer hasn't really changed that much. Now it's performing in our categories, we're seeing it play out in a number of our categories, our recipe mix, hot sauces, we still have a lot of strong sort of consumption growth there. And so we certainly still see it play out. Certainly, there are categories like meat where you see -- you do see some decline going on there. That might affect an item or two here, but we definitely still have a very balanced portfolio where we're seeing still a lot of at-home consumption going on.\nMike Smith: And frankly, historically, you go back, Rob, a long way with us, if a recession does occur, that will drive more people cooking at home. So that bodes well, I think, for our broad portfolio.\nBrendan Foley: Our research, I would say is recent in the last 30 days, is telling us that there is still a sustained level.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I mean if you look at our Flavor Solutions business, I mean, clearly, foodservice is strong. Restaurants have reopened. People are not forced to cook at home. But there still seems to be a strong preference in that direction. And actually, as we went through the first half, we saw in the macro data that there was a return to dining away from home and a reduction in cooking at home. But in recent weeks, that has started to turn back the other way, probably driven by economic pressures on consumers. Cooking at home is more economical.  I think for a variety of reasons, we're still pretty optimistic on the whole retention of cooking at home behaviors. There are some pockets that are different. Baking was really largely driven by kids being at home from school. We've seen baking-related items return to the kind of really pre-pandemic levels. That certainly is a part of our European story where our Vahine brand is a big factor. But overall, the general cooking-at-home trend persists and all of those few meal occasions that are food -- home occasions because of people working remotely continue to support that strong consumption.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up for Brendan. As you're talking to the trade about the holiday seasons and the price increases and consumer behavior, what's the reception been like? Is the price increase well understood for seasons, the reasons why? And are they eager to merchandise aggressively during the holiday season?\nBrendan Foley: Yes, I think the way our conversations are unfolding with customers and looking at the holiday season is one where you're still looking at, I think, improvement in supply across the season. And that is I think one of the things that underpins really a lot of optimism and strength as we go into the back half, especially as we go into this holiday season. We are certainly communicating a strength in our ability to supply and drive the holiday promotions and displays and everything else. So I would say the conversations with customers have been rather positive and strong and the outlook remains pretty healthy. Underpinned by supply, I would say, is one of the important factors there. With -- related to pricing, I mean, I think we work a lot with our customers in making sure that we're both driving category growth. And so that is a big part of our conversations as well. And -- and again, I think those conversations, and we appreciate the partnership and working with our customers on that. But the outlook, I think, remains very healthy.\nLawrence Kurzius: And again, I'll just underscore that, well, we don't want to get too specific on discussions about pricing because there is customer or competitive considerations there and there is always some natural tension in those discussions. Our customers know that we've taken a long-term perspective on our relationship with them, that we are transparent in the reasons for pricing and they themselves are continuing to experience inflation. That's very broad based on some of the same factors that we are. And so those conversations have continued to be quite constructive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask about just the global supply chain dynamics. You obviously are sourcing ingredients from many different places around the world, probably more so than other large packaged food companies. I'd just be curious to hear sort of what you're seeing in terms of global supply chain, domestic supply chain. Where are the real pain points for you now? And is there any light at the end of the tunnel?\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure, Alexia. This is actually a -- I'd say our worst disruption on supply chain really was third quarter of last year and has continued to get better incrementally every month. We're not out of the woods by a long shot in terms of normalization. But the really broad scale disruptions that we were experiencing a year ago are behind us and the disruptions are pretty much more discrete factors. I'd say our global sourcing of raw materials from points all around the world for our various markets around the world has been one of our strengths through the whole pandemic experience and the post-pandemic time and continues to be a strength. Our challenges have been more on either predominantly local packaging issues and specific packaged materials from very specific suppliers. Some of them are -- continue to be a sore point. And then there's -- in areas where we have -- there's still some areas where even though we've added a lot of capacity, the demand is still extraordinary and we're pressed to meet the needs of our customers. And those -- and again, those would be in a few very specific areas.\nAlexia Howard: And then just as a quick follow-up. There was a comment in the press release about unfavorable mix in Flavor Solutions. How important was that? Because obviously, the profit decline was very marked this quarter. And what drove that? And then I'll pass it on.\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean -- it's Mike. I mean unfavorable mix was one of the factors. If you think on a quarter-to-quarter perspective look back here, really strong performance in some of the higher-margin categories kind of -- and this year, the strongest performance was in the away-from-home versus to at-home. So a little bit -- between those two categories we mixed down a little bit, nothing to be concerned about. As we've talked about, Flavor Solutions can be lumpy based on the products we sell and things like that. But that's part of the reason.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I was hoping to just maybe try to understand the second half, kind of framing it maybe from a different light. Because it would seem like the full year guidance implies second half operating margins up about 250 basis points year-over-year. I get that there's an incremental pricing actions that benefit and the price cost balance reflect -- will probably flip positively presumably in the fourth quarter. But also that's a dilutive impact to percent margins. Just trying to get a sense of what -- how do we -- notwithstanding some of the discrete things in the May quarter, specifically to the China impact in particular, but we've got volumes that -- demand elasticity that would suggest volumes aren't going to get better. Between businesses, Flavor Solutions is probably growing faster than Consumer. So that's a mix headwind at the corporate level. And I'm just trying to understand kind of how do we get to that magnitude of percent margin improvement in the back half.\nLawrence Kurzius: Adam, I'm going to start and I'm going to let Mike pick it up. Again, I want to let us underscore that there is a big change in the relationship between pricing and cost as we go through the -- as we go through the year. In the second half, we -- price increases begin to overtake the cost increases and rather than trailing or beginning the year, we're recovering the cost increases. That's going to be a big factor between the continued strong demand and having twice as much effect of pricing in the second half as the first half is going to be a really big factor. Mike, do you want to talk --\nMike Smith: There's other factors to add. I mean we really we talk about pricing as a way to offset cost, and we have other levers when we talk about revenue management, our CCI-led cost savings. So we continue to lean hard on driving additional cost savings in this inflationary environment. We see continued strong demand driving that. High-margin products helping us there. So there's a lot of reasons to believe. To your point, though, I mean, between third and fourth quarter, I mean, the fourth quarter is where a lot of this comes to fruition from getting to a positive margin change year-on-year.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. I'll add. So we don't expect COVID lockdowns to repeat in China. That's a wildcard. We've been surprised there before, that could happen again. We don't think -- we're not expecting that. But that was a big unfavorable in the first half, particularly in the second quarter that we expect to correct and normalize as we go through the second half.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. So maybe just to help clarify that. As we think about the year-to-date second quarter or year-to-date kind of performance. What's been the realized CCI savings year-to-date relative to the 85% that you talked about for the full year? First -- I don't think I heard a specific number in terms of what the realized cost inflation has been year-to-date just relative to that high teens number that you've targeted or you've expected for the full year. And I guess just any way to help dimensionalize some of the -- you gave the brand marketing piece, but other SG&A, just where that magnitude of kind of tightening  there and how much that can contribute in the second half?\nMike Smith: This is weighted to the second half, and that's all I'm going to say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Lawrence, I just wanted to circle back actually to Andrew's question around private label and going back to the slides, you do have a section here talking about more entry price points. And I'm just curious, is that a response to what you see as impending, more share shifting to private label. And so you feel like you need more entry price points? Or is it something else? You talked about inflating cost baskets and maybe in other categories like proteins. And I noticed here you're talking about entry price points on things like Grill Mates and Lawry's, which tend to be more tied to protein. So just curious to kind of get the thoughts around that.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, that really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything to do with private label. What it has to do is there's a concern that consumers may be under pressure as we were seeing some early times the consumers may be feeling some economic pressure. It's no secret that things like gas prices are up. Our customers are -- retailer customers are talking about consumers feeling some pressure. And we have some concern that between the inflationary environment and the high risk of inflation -- sorry, that's the wrong word there, the high risk of recession as we go into the second half and even into 2023, that we want to be able to make sure that consumers, especially in the lower half of the income scale, are still being served and have access to our categories. Our goal is to have products that appeal to consumers at every price point across the whole category. And between our new product launches, our brand marketing and our brand marketing activity, we are taking a tone that tries to address that pressure to consumer. We've got -- I know we're kind of hitting time and General Mills is probably talking right now, but Brendan's got a lot of color that he can add on this question and I'd like to give him a chance to.\nBrendan Foley: Well, I think, Lawrence Kurzius, I think you hit it largely right. We're trying to make sure that our portfolio and our assortment is really geared towards what consumers are starting to face. And it could very well be price points that are lower in terms of smaller sizes. I would say though, also, there's another dynamic on the other end which is happening, which is we actually see even more consumers switching to larger sizes, looking for more value. And so it's playing out really on both ends. And so those are things that we're reacting to and making sure that we drive even more distribution and items in our assortment that serve those needs and those price points that consumers are looking for.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick one. Lawrence, you did mention I think that packaging tightness was impacting a certain couple of categories in U.S. season -- spices and seasonings. Just any more color there? What specifically brands or categories we should be looking at just if that starts to improve, would we see a new\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nLawrence Kurzius: I don't want to get too specific, but I also don't really want to call out our suppliers with whom we're trying to have a constructive  competitors either for that matter. But we had some trouble with glass for our organic spices in our gourmet range that I think we have resolved now. And we've had some ongoing challenges on some other -- more of the rigid container kind of packaging and mostly in the U.S., frankly.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Kurzius, I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you. McCormick's alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor, in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments, provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We're disciplined and are focused on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thank you to everybody joining today's call. I apologize for those that we didn't get to. If you have any further questions, please reach out to me today. And this concludes this morning's call. Thank you very much. And for those of you in the U.S., have a wonderful holiday weekend, grill a lot. And for those of you in Canada, happy Canada Day. And everybody else, have a great weekend.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to start by welcoming Brendan to this morning's call. In addition to his continuing role as President of our Global Consumer business, Brendan now has responsibility for our business worldwide in his newly appointed role as President and COO. At the end of our prepared remarks, I may ask him to weigh in on some of your questions. McCormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other volatility has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our financial objectives. Broadly, our results in the second quarter were in line with our sales and profit expectations despite certain global challenges, including a greater-than-expected level of high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruption in China from COVID-related lockdowns and the conflict in Ukraine. As our second quarter progressed, the dynamics of these conditions intensified and negatively impacted our sales and profit results. Before discussing our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to comment on each of these, starting on Page 5. Consistent with the rest of the industry, high cost inflation and supply chain are continuing challenges. To partially offset cost pressures, we've taken multiple pricing actions and, as planned, we are raising prices again. Inflation continued to escalate, and we've adjusted our upcoming pricing actions accordingly. We appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and reducing discretionary spend where possible. We expect our pricing actions and other levers to begin to outpace cost pressures late in the third quarter, with higher cost and higher offsetting pricing actions than we expected on our last call, which further weights our 2022 profit to the second half of the year. We plan to fully offset cost pressures over time. In China, during the second quarter, there was significant unanticipated disruption in consumption due to severe COVID-related lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities throughout China. China is our second biggest sales country, with operations in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan. Our Shanghai operation produces approximately 40% of our total China sales, which are distributed throughout the country and supports both of our segments. And as a reminder, our branded food service demand is included in our Consumer segment in China. The lockdowns lasted roughly 75 days, with our Shanghai plant forced to close for two weeks at the onset, with employees living in the facility. Once we were able to reopen, we were impacted by lockdown-related labor shortages due to workers being quarantined. During April and May, we incurred significant incremental manufacturing and transportation costs to supply our customers. In addition, as restaurants largely closed and consumers unable to shop for extended periods in our strongest geographies, we experienced significant demand softness as well. Market conditions in China have also allowed very little opportunity to increase prices. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China, but we will not be able to recover the sales and profit impact we experienced in this fiscal year. Finally, regarding the conflict in Ukraine, in mid-March, we suspended operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine were paused. These countries account for less than 1% of our overall business. We have recently decided to exit our Consumer business in Russia. Now for more detail on our second quarter results, starting with sales on Slide 7. Sales declined 1% from the second quarter of last year, including an unfavorable impact from currency. Our constant currency sales were comparable to last year, with growth from pricing actions offset by a decline in volume and product mix. The volume decline was impacted unfavorably by several discrete items, including a 1% impact from the China consumption disruption and the conflict in Ukraine I just mentioned, a 1% impact from the exit of low-margin business in India and a 2% impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment during last year's second quarter. Excluding these items, our sales performance would have been 4% growth, reflecting the strength of our broad global portfolio and effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions. While growth in both segments was impacted by the discrete items, they were more impactful to our Consumer segment. Notably, our growth in Flavor Solutions was outstanding. Comparisons to 2021 and 2020 remain difficult due to the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the second quarter of the last two years. Using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, second quarter sales have grown at a constant currency compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6%. Moving to profit. Adjusted operating income was down 33% or 32% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share was down 30%. The adjusted operating income comparison includes 7% unfavorable impact from the disruption to China's consumption and the conflict in Ukraine. Although we anticipated the profit driven by sales growth in the second quarter would be more than offset by higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, the impact was greater than expected due to continuing cost escalation. While this pressured second quarter profit, we expect to mitigate this impact later this year. Now moving to second quarter business updates for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 9, our second quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions. In the Americas, our first wave of pricing was phased in during our fourth quarter of last year, the second wave during the second quarter in April, and the third wave will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. With the first wave, we saw a very low level of elasticity. With the second wave, we are seeing more price elasticity, although still below historical levels. While consumer spending has remained strong, consumers are now under significant pressure for broad-based inflation, notably fuel prices and other macro factors. As we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. Overall, our pricing actions in EMEA and APZ are on track and our elasticity impacts are similar to the Americas. In EMEA and APZ, pricing timing varies by market within each region. In some markets, particularly in EMEA, there are regulatory guidelines on when we take pricing, which generally creates a lag in the timing of pricing compared to the Americas. In this unprecedented environment, however, we are taking additional action in markets across the EMEA. Now for some further highlights by region, starting Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%. And over the last three years, since 2019, consumption has grown at a three-year CAGR of 7%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. In the Americas, a sales decline in the second quarter included the impact of lapping a 4% over-shipment of consumption to replenish retailer inventories in the second quarter of last year. Our second quarter shipments this year were in line with our consumption change. Demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. However, some products remain stressed by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance of another quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured during the quarter by the shortage of certain packaging materials as well as certain organic spices. Some of these have been resolved and some will remain ongoing. We continue to use our category and revenue management capability to strengthen our spices and seasoning portfolio and optimize the category performance for both McCormick and our retailers. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we will begin to realize later this year. In EMEA, we continue to have strong share performance in most categories and markets. During the second quarter, we lapped strong year-ago consumption, partially due to last year's COVID-related restrictions throughout EMEA, where restrictions extended longer than other regions. Our Vahine brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line unique to our EMEA region, was most impacted as recently we've seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level. In other categories in the region, we believe there has been a step-up in consumption. And in the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to the consumption disruption in China, second quarter growth was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India. At the end of last year, we decided to exit our rice business, the Kohinoor brand, to enable the region to focus on our higher-margin core category. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our sales performance for the quarter was outstanding, with both pricing and volume growth contributing. We drove double-digit growth in both the at-home and away-from-home parts of our portfolio. Looking at our Flavor Solutions growth over the past three years, since the COVID-19 restrictions caused dramatic second quarter comparisons in '20 and '21, our sales CAGR is 8%, largely driven by volumes. Our pricing actions increased sales in all three regions. Broadly, pricing actions in the branded foodservice part of our portfolio followed the same cadence as those in each region in Consumer business. In the rest of our Flavor Solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows, with automatic price adjusters in many contracts and the timing is going to vary based on those windows. In this dynamic environment though, with costs escalating so quickly, we are having discussions outside of those windows and passing costs through faster than usual. Higher volumes also contributed to growth in the Americas and EMEA region. Demand has remained strong for certain parts of our business in these regions. Our supply chain is being pressured to meet this demand and we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us through this pressure. In the Americas, where our customer base is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, our at-home customers, strong growth was driven by flavors for savory snacks as well as performance nutrition and health applications with these customers. In EMEA, our customer base is more skewed to quick service restaurants or QSRs, and our strong QSR momentum contributed to growth in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution. Branded foodservice growth was strong in both the Americas and EMEA regions, driven by restaurant and institutional food service customers. Demand continues to strengthen in this channel, particularly as travel accelerates and restaurants benefit from consumers shifting to take-away and delivery. Overall, our Flavor Solutions sales demand and growth momentum continues to be strong. Now let me expand on our growth platform and positioning in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, but the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste, with the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor. We continue to make investments to sustainably meet the growing demand and to fuel further growth. In our global supply chain, we increased our capacity with our recently opened U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility and have begun our expansion of FONA's footprint to support future flavor growth. We are also increasing our capacity in the fast-growing hot-sauce category and investing in seasoning capacity to support increased demand and strengthen resiliency. As we've said, with the sustained level of high consumer demand, we're benefiting from the manufacturing capacity we've added. While we still experienced disruptions in the supply chain, they are much more specific mainly from a transportation and packaging supply standpoint. We experienced the peak disruption in the third quarter of last year. And with every month, the supply chain continues to get better, we feel good about the progress we're making. We are strategically investing behind our brands to drive growth, including in brand marketing, as we did throughout the pandemic with our three-year brand marketing CAGR approximating our consumer segment sales CAGR for the same period. We're pivoting our messaging to emphasize to consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollar. For instance, we're launching a digital messaging highlighting the value of our product by making a great flavorful meal economically. We add flavor for only pennies per serving and recipes like our 30-minute Taco Casserole are family and budget-friendly answers to what's for dinner. We continue to invest in new products. In our Consumer segment, we are responding to new consumer behaviors, like increased at-home lunches. For instance, our new patent pending French's Creamy Mustard is off to a great start. We're sensitive to the needs of price-conscious consumers, not just in these challenging economic times, but every day. Our portfolio includes branded items to accommodate consumers' needs and provide solutions for everyone at every price point as well as private label products. Our new product launches include additional entry-level price point product for affordability and larger sizes of key high usage items for better value. While we are still seeing strong consumer spending, we know that inflation is a significant concern for consumers, more so than COVID. We're leveraging our proprietary research, which served us well during the pandemic, to monitor for any signals of changing behavior. Our research continues to indicate consumers are going to cook as much at home or more than they did during the pandemic for many reasons. One of them is that they find it more economical. To the extent there is a recession, it further reinforces cooking at home, and we know from our past sales performance that our categories and brands perform well during a recessionary period. Now for some summary comments on Slide 13 before turning it over to Mike. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years regardless of the environment, the long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. The strength of our business value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly gives us confidence, in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate a challenging global environment. Despite the pressures we experienced in the second quarter, we are well positioned and confident in delivering strong performance in 2022 and beyond, while driving sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. Their agility and their teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. And now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 29. Our long-term performance has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our objectives, including through volatile environments. The long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remained strong. Several discrete items unfavorably impact our sales comparison to the second quarter of last year. Excluding these impacts, our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, the effective execution of our strategies and our pricing actions. Our sales growth momentum is strong. Persistent high cost inflation and supply chain challenges intensified as the second quarter progressed and unfavorably impacted our profit. Importantly, we expect to mitigate this impact in the second half of the year. We're confident that with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and our ability to navigate challenging environments, we will drive another year of strong performance in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to your questions. Sure, Andrew. Well, first of all, our plan, as we shared on previous calls and conferences, has always been back half-loaded and stronger in the second half than in the first half. And one of the factors driving that is the cadence of our pricing actions. There is twice as much effective pricing in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year. As you can see, right now, for the quarter, our pricing contribution to sales was about 7% and it's significantly higher going into the second half of the year. And that is a big driver of total sales build third quarter, fourth quarter. And that's -- I mean that's the driver of sales. It's also the driver on the operating profit, EPS and so on as we go through. The second thing is that we did not expect the disruption that we had in China in the second quarter. The extent of the lockdown was a surprise to us and I think to everybody. And China is a big contributor to us and we expect a normalization of business in China as we go through the second half. Particularly, we really expect it to be normal by the time we get to fourth quarter. And just our experience with the initial COVID lockdown a couple of years ago tells us that once we get normalization, there's a significant surge in restocking by both the consumer and by our trade channels. And so, we would expect a strong contribution from China in the second half of the year. And then finally, our U.S. and EMEA have less difficult comparisons going in through the second half than they did in the first half of the year, not lapping inventory replenishment that we talked about last year and also not lapping some of the COVID lockdowns that were still in effect, particularly in the second quarter. And finally, we expect continued strong underlying demand from our consumers and our customers that we're continuing to see. Mike, do you have anything you want to add to that? Do you want to add something? I don't think that there's anything of special note there. We are seeing some trade held by consumers, not just in our category but in other categories that we track. It's no surprise that consumers at the lower end of the income scale particularly are feeling a bit of pressure from inflation, not ours, but inflation across everything. I mean, gas prices are $5 or $6 a gallon, depending on where you live, and that puts pressure on consumers' pocketbook. But I would say that it's still at a pretty low level, particularly when we look at our brands and the elasticity that we're experiencing, it's still significantly below historical levels and it's not a particular concern. I'd say also, I'll add to that, our sales with private label products are certainly an important part of our business but not particularly surging. Yes, Ken, let me start with that. I'm going to let Mike point in on that. But I think you're in the right neighborhood with those numbers. We took -- first, when I think about the cadence of our increases and the timing of their effectiveness, you're in the right neighborhood when you think about going from 6% to 12% in the second half. I would have that -- again, our next pricing action in the Americas, our largest region, is in August. And so if you're thinking about phasing that, you should have that in mind as well. Steve, this is Lawrence. And I think that you -- some of the little things that I think we're going to want to come back and talk about some of those marginal changes that you talked about. But on the big picture item, you've got it exactly right. And in fact, this was part of what we were trying to message at your recent conference. The big change here are the things that were external factors that surprised us and that is what's flowing through.  I'll let Mike walk through the actual fringe on that. But -- And Steve, I would really underscore that timing aspect. A one-month difference on the effective date of our price increase, we would be having a different conversation. It would be $0.11, $0.12 of EPS on the quarter. And -- and of course, those price increases are in effect I would just say they  one month earlier. That's what the difference would have been. That's one reason why we're pretty confident that the -- that we're going to catch up with the cost. Brendan, I'm going to let you take that one. And I mean if you look at our Flavor Solutions business, I mean, clearly, foodservice is strong. Restaurants have reopened. People are not forced to cook at home. But there still seems to be a strong preference in that direction. And actually, as we went through the first half, we saw in the macro data that there was a return to dining away from home and a reduction in cooking at home. But in recent weeks, that has started to turn back the other way, probably driven by economic pressures on consumers. Cooking at home is more economical.  I think for a variety of reasons, we're still pretty optimistic on the whole retention of cooking at home behaviors. There are some pockets that are different. Baking was really largely driven by kids being at home from school. We've seen baking-related items return to the kind of really pre-pandemic levels. That certainly is a part of our European story where our Vahine brand is a big factor. But overall, the general cooking-at-home trend persists and all of those few meal occasions that are food -- home occasions because of people working remotely continue to support that strong consumption. And again, I'll just underscore that, well, we don't want to get too specific on discussions about pricing because there is customer or competitive considerations there and there is always some natural tension in those discussions. Our customers know that we've taken a long-term perspective on our relationship with them, that we are transparent in the reasons for pricing and they themselves are continuing to experience inflation. That's very broad based on some of the same factors that we are. And so those conversations have continued to be quite constructive. Sure, Alexia. This is actually a -- I'd say our worst disruption on supply chain really was third quarter of last year and has continued to get better incrementally every month. We're not out of the woods by a long shot in terms of normalization. But the really broad scale disruptions that we were experiencing a year ago are behind us and the disruptions are pretty much more discrete factors. I'd say our global sourcing of raw materials from points all around the world for our various markets around the world has been one of our strengths through the whole pandemic experience and the post-pandemic time and continues to be a strength. Our challenges have been more on either predominantly local packaging issues and specific packaged materials from very specific suppliers. Some of them are -- continue to be a sore point. And then there's -- in areas where we have -- there's still some areas where even though we've added a lot of capacity, the demand is still extraordinary and we're pressed to meet the needs of our customers. And those -- and again, those would be in a few very specific areas. Adam, I'm going to start and I'm going to let Mike pick it up. Again, I want to let us underscore that there is a big change in the relationship between pricing and cost as we go through the -- as we go through the year. In the second half, we -- price increases begin to overtake the cost increases and rather than trailing or beginning the year, we're recovering the cost increases. That's going to be a big factor between the continued strong demand and having twice as much effect of pricing in the second half as the first half is going to be a really big factor. Mike, do you want to talk -- Yes. I'll add. So we don't expect COVID lockdowns to repeat in China. That's a wildcard. We've been surprised there before, that could happen again. We don't think -- we're not expecting that. But that was a big unfavorable in the first half, particularly in the second quarter that we expect to correct and normalize as we go through the second half. Yes, that really doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t have anything to do with private label. What it has to do is there's a concern that consumers may be under pressure as we were seeing some early times the consumers may be feeling some economic pressure. It's no secret that things like gas prices are up. Our customers are -- retailer customers are talking about consumers feeling some pressure. And we have some concern that between the inflationary environment and the high risk of inflation -- sorry, that's the wrong word there, the high risk of recession as we go into the second half and even into 2023, that we want to be able to make sure that consumers, especially in the lower half of the income scale, are still being served and have access to our categories. Our goal is to have products that appeal to consumers at every price point across the whole category. And between our new product launches, our brand marketing and our brand marketing activity, we are taking a tone that tries to address that pressure to consumer. We've got -- I know we're kind of hitting time and General Mills is probably talking right now, but Brendan's got a lot of color that he can add on this question and I'd like to give him a chance to. I don't want to get too specific, but I also don't really want to call out our suppliers with whom we're trying to have a constructive  competitors either for that matter. But we had some trouble with glass for our organic spices in our gourmet range that I think we have resolved now. And we've had some ongoing challenges on some other -- more of the rigid container kind of packaging and mostly in the U.S., frankly. Thank you. McCormick's alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor, in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments, provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We're disciplined and are focused on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders."

            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Rob, we're -- I guess, just to react to some of the thoughts you just shared there. We're seeing through a lot of our research, also what we're seeing in secondary research out there, is that there's still a heavy level of sustained cooking at home in the data overall, whether we're researching it or we're getting it from some of our suppliers there. We definitely see a sustained level of eating at home. And overall, I would say that the consumer hasn't really changed that much. Now it's performing in our categories, we're seeing it play out in a number of our categories, our recipe mix, hot sauces, we still have a lot of strong sort of consumption growth there. And so we certainly still see it play out. Certainly, there are categories like meat where you see -- you do see some decline going on there. That might affect an item or two here, but we definitely still have a very balanced portfolio where we're seeing still a lot of at-home consumption going on. Our research, I would say is recent in the last 30 days, is telling us that there is still a sustained level. Yes, I think the way our conversations are unfolding with customers and looking at the holiday season is one where you're still looking at, I think, improvement in supply across the season. And that is I think one of the things that underpins really a lot of optimism and strength as we go into the back half, especially as we go into this holiday season. We are certainly communicating a strength in our ability to supply and drive the holiday promotions and displays and everything else. So I would say the conversations with customers have been rather positive and strong and the outlook remains pretty healthy. Underpinned by supply, I would say, is one of the important factors there. With -- related to pricing, I mean, I think we work a lot with our customers in making sure that we're both driving category growth. And so that is a big part of our conversations as well. And -- and again, I think those conversations, and we appreciate the partnership and working with our customers on that. But the outlook, I think, remains very healthy. Well, I think, Lawrence Kurzius, I think you hit it largely right. We're trying to make sure that our portfolio and our assortment is really geared towards what consumers are starting to face. And it could very well be price points that are lower in terms of smaller sizes. I would say though, also, there's another dynamic on the other end which is happening, which is we actually see even more consumers switching to larger sizes, looking for more value. And so it's playing out really on both ends. And so those are things that we're reacting to and making sure that we drive even more distribution and items in our assortment that serve those needs and those price points that consumers are looking for."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 15. Our top line constant currency sales were comparable to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 7% growth from pricing actions, offset by a 7% decline in volume and product mix. Excluding the 4% impact of the discrete item Lawrence mentioned earlier, our sales performance would have reflected 4% growth. Consumer segment sales declined 7% in constant currency. The impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment, the consumption disruption in China, the exit of low-margin business in India and the conflict in the Ukraine contributed 6% to that decline. The remaining 1% decline was due to lower volume, partially offset by pricing actions. On a three-year basis, our second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 4%. On Slide 16, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and mix, partially offset by pricing actions. This decline is attributable to lapping trade inventory replenishments in the second quarter of last year. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 7%. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 11%, primarily due to lapping high year-ago demand driven by COVID-related lockdowns, the most significant impact of which was lower sales of Vahine homemade dessert products. A 1% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia and Ukraine also contributed to the decline. Pricing actions in all markets partially offset the lower volume. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 18%, including a 20% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low-margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. On a three-year basis, APZ's second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was a 7% decline, driven by the China and India impact I just mentioned. Excluding this impact, sales grew at a 5% CAGR over the past three years. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 19. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 11% due to pricing actions as well as higher volume and mix. This growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in sales related to the combined impact of the China disruption and the conflict in Ukraine. Second quarter constant currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% CAGR. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales grew 12%, driven by both pricing and the combination of volume and mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth, with higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing to growth. Over the past three years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%. In EMEA, we drove 19% constant currency sales growth with a 14% increase in volume and mix and 5% related to pricing actions. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to the conflict in Ukraine, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and branded foodservice customers. Over the past three years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 10% CAGR. In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales declined 6% in constant currency. The decline was driven by a 7% impact from lower volume in China due to the COVID-related restrictions, partially offset by pricing actions in all markets across the region. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 3% CAGR over the past three years. As seen on Slide 23, adjusted gross profit margin declined 550 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Realizing this is a sizable compression, I will spend a moment on the significant drivers. Let me start with the drivers we anticipated. First, nearly half of this decline, approximately 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This impact was more significant than in the first quarter because of the higher level of pricing in the second quarter. Product mix was unfavorable as compared to the second quarter of last year. In our Consumer segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are lapping strong U.S. spices and seasonings growth related to the inventory replenishment. In our Flavor Solutions segment, sales growth in our away-from-home products was higher than our at-home products and we are lapping strong sales of beverage flavors last year. A sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by start-up and dual running costs as we transitioned production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. Of note, CCI-led cost savings partially offset the impacts I just walked through and we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. In addition to the net impact of the anticipated items I just detailed, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by the following items: As Lawrence discussed, cost inflation and supply chain pressures escalated during the second quarter impacting our results more than expected, primarily related to transportation costs and faster-turning materials. While we have adjusted our upcoming pricing actions to reflect that escalation and we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time, our second quarter gross margin compression reflects the usual lag associated with pricing. We expect pricing to begin outpacing the cost pressures later this year and continue into next year. Our cost recovery will vary by region and segment. Currently, our pricing lag is more significant in our Flavor Solutions segment. Lawrence previously mentioned we have incremental costs to meet strong demand for certain parts of our Flavor Solutions business, thus impacting our gross margin. And finally, as already mentioned, significant cost due to the COVID-related restrictions in China had an unfavorable impact to profit. Moving to Slide 24. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower than the second quarter of last year and as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points. The decline was driven by lower employee benefit and brand marketing expenses as well as discretionary spending reductions, partially offset by higher distribution costs. The decline in brand marketing investments was driven by China and Russia reductions. Importantly, across our other markets, we invested in brand marketing at a comparable level to last year. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 29%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 40%. A 1% unfavorable impact from currency is included in each of these declines. Turning to income taxes on Slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6% compared to 22.2% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. At the bottom line, please turn on Slide 26, second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. On Slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $154 million through the second quarter of 2022 compared to $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income. Cash flow from operations will be weighted to the second half of the year, similar to our profit growth. We returned $198 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $102 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 28. As a reminder, last quarter, the conditions in Russia, Ukraine and China were just unfolding and cost inflation and supply chain challenges remain dynamic and fast moving. Today, we have a better view of the macro environment and our guidance for the full year considers the greater impact from these items. In addition, and as noted previously, we have always expected our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We now expect it to be even more so. We are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by the global challenges I just mentioned. We also expect there will be an estimated two-percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, an increase from our previous estimate of one-percentage point unfavorable. On the top line, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing, which will accelerate significantly in the second half versus the first half. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by increasing elasticity, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio as well as the impact of demand disruptions in China and Ukraine. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. We are now projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 200 basis points to 150 basis points lower than 2021. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment, cost pressures have outpaced our pricing and future actions have been adjusted to reflect the higher cost level. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impacts from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We now expect to grow our adjusted operating income 2% to 4% in constant currency. In addition to the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million and brand marketing investments comparable to 2021 which reflects reductions in China and Russia. Considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items as well as our estimated mix of earnings by geography, we now project our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%. We are lowering our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations to a range of $3.03 to $3.08. This compares to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and represents a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% or in constant currency, growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and an expected $15 million benefit from the impact of optimizing our debt portfolio. In addition, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue our operating momentum and drive another year of strong performance. Yes. I think I'd add that we see a lot of strength in our Flavor Solutions business. We saw that in the second quarter and we know that will continue in the second half. So we certainly think that's going to support, I think, really our outlook for the second half overall. But also we're seeing a lot of new business come through in the back half of the year in both segments. And so we see a lot of strength coming through on that, too. So, the growth again does look even stronger as we move towards the back half. I'd also just add, you're going to see it across both Consumer and Flavor Solutions pretty much at the same level. Ken, this is Mike. That's a great question. We see -- actually, the cost peak year-on-year we see is third quarter and a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter. We see the pricing obviously growing second to third to fourth. So I think what you'll see is some -- still some gross margin challenges in the third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, the combination impact of that pricing and full benefit there and the cost. And also think about the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter overall from a volume perspective there. And as Lawrence said before, things like China, which we make really the margin on, as that recovers from third into fourth, too, that should be a positive for 4Q. Yes. If you think about our guidance, we're coming down $0.14. If you think about from a China, Russia, Ukraine perspective, that's $0.11 right there. And then FX, as you said, we're going up 1%, that's $0.03. So there's your $0.14. Now we're recognizing that the cost inflation which you mentioned, we had mid to high double digit, we actually moved that to high double digit. So 1% to 2% more cost during the year driven by transportation, packaging, things like that. So that did hurt us in the second quarter. However -- and we're dropping a bit of that through the rest of the year, we have pricing to help mitigate that. And then below the line, some of the things you talked about, tax is a little bit of a help. Some of the interest expense things are going to help offset that. But the big drivers of the external factors -- the one thing I wanted to just correct you on brand or just to give you insight, brand marketing is now flat. However, that is really driven by the reduction in China, Russia, Ukraine and FX. So we're still spending up in our big markets to drive growth. The one thing I'd say, and you're new to our business, but the China business to us is very material. It's our second biggest market. We have three large manufacturing facilities. And the shutdown really put a lot of pressure on our cost there, a lot of extra cost for transportation, loss absorption, things like that. So as that business recovers, obviously, that goes away. I think the other thing, too, is if you think about some of these costs that came up rapidly like transportation and packaging. I mean, fuel cost, if you go back to March, gasoline prices in the quarter versus March were up 25%. That stuff rolls through the P&L very quickly. And pricing will catch up on that, but a one-month lag in pricing could be $30 million to $40 million of impact, which is like $0.10 a share. So we're mitigating that as quickly as we can, but sometimes we see that as kind of stabilizing now. And going forward, like I told you, the third and fourth quarter, where we see our cost outlook. But I think that is -- to your point about what is transitory, what is not, I think that gets the most of it. So that's why I said that's going to really help us in the fourth quarter more. It's still -- different levels of openings that are happening now, that will happen throughout the quarter, yes. And frankly, historically, you go back, Rob, a long way with us, if a recession does occur, that will drive more people cooking at home. So that bodes well, I think, for our broad portfolio. Yes. I mean -- it's Mike. I mean unfavorable mix was one of the factors. If you think on a quarter-to-quarter perspective look back here, really strong performance in some of the higher-margin categories kind of -- and this year, the strongest performance was in the away-from-home versus to at-home. So a little bit -- between those two categories we mixed down a little bit, nothing to be concerned about. As we've talked about, Flavor Solutions can be lumpy based on the products we sell and things like that. But that's part of the reason. There's other factors to add. I mean we really we talk about pricing as a way to offset cost, and we have other levers when we talk about revenue management, our CCI-led cost savings. So we continue to lean hard on driving additional cost savings in this inflationary environment. We see continued strong demand driving that. High-margin products helping us there. So there's a lot of reasons to believe. To your point, though, I mean, between third and fourth quarter, I mean, the fourth quarter is where a lot of this comes to fruition from getting to a positive margin change year-on-year. This is weighted to the second half, and that's all I'm going to say."

Before I go to business, it is with great sadness that I mention the passing of Buzz McCormick, who is 1 of the most beloved and admired leaders in McCormick's history. Buzz's career at McCormic span 50 years rising through the ranks across many functions becoming President and CEO in 1987 and serving as Chairman of the Board for a total of 11 years until his retirement for the third time in 1999. As CEO, Buzz focused McCormick on flavor by divesting noncore businesses and driving category leadership in spices and seasonings, setting the course for McCormick to be the global leader in flavor. Notably, McCormick's market cap grew by 4x under his leadership.  Buzz will not only be remembered for his enduring legacy of performance but just as importantly, for his deep commitment to the well-being of all McCormick employees. He truly made McCormick a great place to work, leaving his biggest accomplishment as a CEO is helping all McCormick employees have a better life. Today, as we reflect on his life and its contributions, we know that his legacy will live on. He has inspired many generations of McCormick leaders with his passion for people, focus on flavor and commitment to delivering shareholder value. Next, I'd like to comment on the situation in Ukraine. First and foremost, we extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine and hope for an immediate end to the conflict and the suffering of innocent people. As we previously announced, we suspended our operations in Russia in mid-March. Our operations in Ukraine have been paused to focus on the safety of our employees and their families. Our thoughts are with the people impacted by these tragic events, particularly our employees who we continue to support through aid in humanitarian efforts we're donating to the Polish Center for International Aid and the World Centre for Pigeon. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to our EMEA employees, especially those in Poland for their many personal efforts in aiding their Ukrainian neighbors in need. Their actions epitomize our power of people principle. Now moving to Slide 4 and our business results. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategies and the engagement of employees. We are confident our strong year-to-date momentum will continue to drive strong performance throughout 2022. In the first quarter, we grew sales 3% or 4% in constant currency on top of our 20% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year, demonstrating again the strength of our product offering and broad global portfolio, which drives differentiated growth and consistency in our performance. Consumer segment sales, while lapping high year ago demand continued to reflect the sustained shift to higher at-home consumption compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our Flavor Solutions segment growth was driven by outstanding growth with our packaged food and beverage customers as well as robust demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers due in part to recovery from curtailed away-from-home dining in the year ago period. Through the breadth and reach of our balanced flavor portfolio, we are meeting the global demand for flavor and delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products we are end-to-end flavor. Adjusted operating income was down 14% or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share was down 13%. As anticipated, the profit driven by our sales growth was more than offset by the well-known and anticipated effects of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges. We have a demonstrated history of successfully navigating through a volatile environment, and we expect to do the same through this high current inflationary period using pricing and other levers to offset cost pressures, which is reflected in our 2022 profit outlook. Now for more on our first quarter segment performance. Starting with the Consumer segment on Slide 5. Growth in the Americas was more than offset by lower sales in the EMEA and APZ regions. Total Consumer segment sales declined 2% against 35% consumer growth in the first quarter of 2021. Given the difficult year-over-year comparison, volume declines were reflected in each region. On a 2-year basis, however, compared to the first quarter of 2020, each region grew sales by double digits. This growth highlights the strength of our categories and importantly, our products as consumers continue to cook more at home, demand for flavor continues to grow. The pricing actions we have taken were also reflected in each region's results, and the elasticity impact we experienced has been lower than historical levels. As we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, and this could be a cumulative effect, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. Turning to highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 2% which follows a 15% consumption increase in the first quarter of 2021. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit consumption growth versus the 2 year ago period. Demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. Our first quarter shipments were in line with consumption, however, some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve as does our share performance with another sequential improvement in the first quarter as we expected. Versus last year, we are beginning to grow our spices and seasoning share and in recipe mixes, we had another quarter of considerable share gain over 4 share points. We continue to see further improvement as we begin the second quarter, and we are confident in our continued momentum. In EMEA during the first quarter, we lapped high prior year demand, partially due to restrictions resulting from COVID resurgences last year while continuing our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our market share performance was stronger this quarter. We maintained our total EMEA region herb, spices and seasoning share on top of strong gains in the first quarters of the last 2 years. Of note, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption 60% and gained significant share versus the 2 year ago period. And in the Asia Pacific region, first quarter growth was tempered by scaled down Chinese New Year celebration due to several cities in China imposing restrictions as a result of new COVID outbreaks.These restrictions impacted our branded food service demand that is included in the consumer segment in China.  Turning to Slide 6. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 12% or 14% in constant currency driven by base business growth, new products and 1 month of incremental sales for our acquisition of FONA in December 2020. All 3 regions contributed to our growth each with higher volume and product mix as well as the pricing actions to partially offset costs. Our first quarter Flavor Solutions results reflect similar market conditions across the region. As a reminder, our customer base in the Americas is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers and in EMEA and APZ to quick service restaurant or QSR customers. Our differentiated customer engagement and technical capabilities continue to drive outstanding growth, both in base business and with new products, with our packaged food and beverage customers or at home customer base. Our performance with these customers led our first quarter Flavor Solutions results with double-digit growth in flavors for Performance Nutrition and health end market applications as well as savory snacks. And our momentum with flavors for alcoholic beverages also continued. Our QSR momentum has been strong with core menu items and limited time offers driving first quarter growth and other restaurant business continues to rebound. Our first quarter results also reflect the lapping of curtailed away-from-home dining last year. The restaurants are benefiting from the shift to takeaway and delivery that was amplified by the pandemic. There's been a blurring between channels and most of the restaurant food being consumed off-premise. For instance, 1 in 4 dinners consumed at home was supplemented with a restaurant or other foodservice items. For our other institutional food service customers and our branded foodservice product category, we expected some recovery coming into 2022, and we saw that demand strengthen in our first quarter and drove growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. Now I'd like to share some comments on our momentum and the growth initiatives we have underway. Turning to Slide 7. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. Our alignment with these trends, in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies sustainably positions us for future growth. In this current dynamic global environment, we remain focused on long-term sustainable growth. We continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges. To partially offset rise in cost we raised prices where appropriate late last year and are currently facing an additional pricing actions. And as costs have continued to accelerate, we will raise prices again this year where appropriate. We appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have successfully grown and compounded our growth regardless of the environment and plan to do so again in 2022 as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. In our Consumer segment, across our major measured markets, we have gained millions of households over the last 2 years and had double-digit buyer rate growth. Our brands have gained new consumers, and we have driven increased usage at the same time. This performance, combined with billions of additional at-home eating occasions from consumers cooking more at home has created a new baseline for growth. We are continuing to drive our consumer segment momentum by accelerating flavor usage, including delivering on the demand for heat, building confidence in the kitchen and inspiring flavor exploration. We're also strengthening our consumer relationships at every point of purchase and creating a delicious, healthy and sustainable future. We are fueling growth through our brand marketing investments, category management initiatives and new products. Our brand marketing is resonating with consumers, particularly as we connect with them online. And as we expand the capabilities of our marketing excellence organization globally, we're gaining efficiencies, executing with greater speed and shifting our investments to work in dollars to drive greater effectiveness. Our U.S. spice aisle reinvention is further driving our category leadership with growth for McCormick and our customers. This initiative is continuing this year with additional stores being implemented and we're also starting to build momentum with similar initiatives in Canada, the U.K. and France. Our consumer new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. Our new products are focused on what\u2019s important to consumers, such as freshness, modern packaging, convenience and flavor exploration as well as affordability and value. 75% of global consumers find it more economical to cook at home. And in the current inflationary environment, it resonates even more now. Our products are already part of the consumer solution to manage inflation across their whole grocery basket. For instance, inflation is hitting the meat case hard and a little bit of our flavor can make less impressive meat, more palatable and make the consumers whole meal both more affordable and fiber. We have products at all price points that attract many types of consumers and households as well as different income levels. We continue to focus on ensuring we're launching new products that appeal to all types of consumers such as additional entry-level price points for affordability as well as value offerings, including larger sizes to meet the needs of price-conscious consumers. And with our new products and recipes tailored, the popular new appliances such as air fryers and Instant Pot, we are providing consumers flavor inspiration and greater convenience when using our products. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we plan to continue migrating our portfolio to more value-added products and technically insulated products, particularly our Flavor product category. We're targeting opportunities to grow with our customers in attractive, high-growth end markets such as alcoholic beverages, savory snacks and Performance Nutrition.We have been outpacing the market growth in these categories. They all contributed towards a strong growth in our first quarter results and further migrate our portfolio. Following a record year of new product growth last year, we are excited about our robust 2022 pipeline of culinary inspired innovation. We are leveraging our broad technology platform to develop clean label, organic and better-for-you solutions to some of our customers' issues without compromising on taste. We're using Sage, our AI-enabled product development tool to develop consumer preferred flavors at an increased speed that have a track record for lasting longer in the market for our customers. And we are building a pipeline of opportunities to accelerate our global seasoning growth by expanding our mid-tier customer base being added to core supplier list and strengthening our leadership in heat. We plan to continue to drive flavor solutions growth through a differentiated customer engagement. We have a strong passion for creating a flawless customer experience. Across both segments, our installed sales and growth plans bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory. We also recognize we are operating in a challenging global environment. Before Mike reiterates our guidance in a few moments, I'd like to comment on some current conditions. We will continue to monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine very closely and adapt accordingly. Cost inflation has remained persistent with recent escalation in some areas such as transportation costs. And as such, we have raised our cost inflation guidance. It is now a mid- to high-teen increase. And in regard to COVID, as I mentioned earlier, there are new COVID restrictions being imposed in several cities in China. We are continually assessing the dynamics of these conditions as they involve we recognize there will be some near-term impact, which we expect to mitigate later in the year, in part with additional pricing actions. We are well positioned to deliver another strong year of growth and performance in 2022 and through the effective execution of our strategy and with a robust operating momentum. In addition to delivering top-tier financial results, we are also committed to doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. We recently released our 2021 purpose-led performance progress report, which highlights our key initiatives and the progress we are making, including our recent announcements on the update of our science-based targets, reduced greenhouse gas submissions by 2030, aligning with the United Nations 1.5 degree Celsius target as well as our commitment to net zero by 2050. As we move forward in 2022, we are excited to continue to share our progress and success on all our purpose-led performance goals. Now for some summary comments on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike. The combination of our strong business model, the investments we have made, the capabilities we have built and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are actively responding to changing market conditions, consumer behaviors and customer needs while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing environment. We have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate in today\u2019s environment responding with agility to volatility and disruption while remaining focused on the long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. Through the execution of our strategy that are designed to drive long-term value, we have grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years, regardless of the environment. Our fundamentals that drove that performance and our momentum and outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment, their agility and teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line growth continues to be strong. During the first quarter, we grew constant currency sales 4%, driven by pricing actions across both segments and incremental sales from our FONA acquisition. Consumer segment sales declined 2% in constant currency due to lapping high demand in all 3 regions last year, with a partial offset from pricing. On a 2-year basis, compared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 30% with double-digit growth in all 3 regions, reflecting the sustained shift to at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume of the product mix due to lapping last year's elevated demand. Branded products led the growth with strength in McCormick, Zatarain's, Stubb's, Otay, Simply Asia, Frank's RedHot and French's, partially offset by a decline in private label. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 9% from a year ago, driven by lower volume and product mix, most significantly in Vahin\u00e9 homemade dessert products due to lapping last year's high demand across the region. This decline was partially offset by pricing actions. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 6%, driven by the exit of lower-margin business in India. China's consumer and branded foodservice demand partially related to the Chinese New Year impact Laurence mentioned earlier, also contributed to the decline. These declines were partially offset by pricing actions. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew first quarter constant currency sales 14%, including a 2% contribution from incremental FONA sales in December. As a reminder, we acquired FONA on December 30, 2020. The remaining increase was driven by higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 18%, with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 12%, with FONA contributing 2% and the remaining growth due to both pricing and the combination of volume and product mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth with the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing. In the EMEA, we drove 24% constant currency sales growth with a 17% increase in volume and product mix and 7% related to pricing actions. EMEA's growth was led by the robust recovery of demand from QSRs and branded foodservice customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions and growth from higher volume and product mix. This growth was driven by our QSR customers, both in their core menu items as well as their limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on Slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges declined 14% or in constant currency, 12% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Adjusted operating income declined 12% in the Consumer segment with minimal impact from currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 17% or 11% in constant currency. Both segments were unfavorably impacted by higher inflation and distribution costs. Both of which accelerated in the second half of last year as well as incremental investment spending on our ERP program, which we expected to be higher earlier in 2022 versus 2021. CCI-led cost savings favorably impacted both segments. In the Consumer segment, lower sales, partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19-related costs also contributed to the decline. In the Flavor Solutions segment, higher sales were more than offset by the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned as well as costs related to supply chain investments, which will continue in the second quarter. As seen on Slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This was driven by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the pricing actions we have taken. We estimate the dilutive impact of pricing to offset this dollar inflation increase was approximately 200 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, a sales shift between segments also contributed to the margin decline. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year due to higher distribution costs and a higher level of investment in our ERP program. This, combined with the adjusted gross margin compression, resulted in an adjusted margin decline of 280 basis points, in line with our expectations. Turning to income taxes on Slide 23. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19.7% compared to 22.7% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 30% versus the first quarter of 2021, due to the elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest as well as higher inflation costs impacting our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.72 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an inflow of $18 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to an outflow of $32 million in the first quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by working capital improvements and lower payments for transaction and integration costs related to our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We returned $99 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $44 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 27. First, I would like to provide some additional perspective on some of the current conditions Lawrence mentioned earlier. As we have said, we are currently not operating in Russia and the Ukraine. And while the impact is not fully known, our business in these markets is small with the combined sales across both segments totaling less than 1% of total company sales last year.  Additionally, we have no manufacturing in either country. Any operating profit impact would include those related to the impact on sales as well as potential expenses stemming from the current situation. Regarding cost inflation, we are revising our outlook and are now projecting inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens as compared to mid-teens increase in our previous guidance. We expect cost inflation to remain persistent, especially as it relates to transportation, and we are continuing actions to mitigate these costs, including pricing. Again, as Lawrence mentioned, we recognize these dynamics will have some impacts on our results, certainly in the second quarter. While we continue to monitor impacts on the broader economy and will adapt as necessary we are reiterating our 2022 sales and profit outlook that we previously shared in our January earnings call. We are projecting strong top line growth and operating performance with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. We expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth with volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the cooling of lower margin business from our portfolio. Our 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid- to high-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases, we do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19-related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. As we shared on our last earnings call, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we are phasing in pricing actions and with costs continuing to escalate, we'll raise prices again as appropriate. While we plan to cover the cost pressures due to the recent acceleration of inflation, there will be a lag. And as a result, our profit will now be weighted to the second half of the year, even more than originally expected. And as a reminder, we expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021. Our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind I just mentioned. This resulted in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22 compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. In summary, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue to accelerate our operating momentum and drive another year of strong growth and performance.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. We delivered solid first quarter results in line with our expectations with strong sales growth on top of our 20% constant currency growth last year. We are confident that the hard work and dedication of our employees will continue to drive momentum. We recognize we're operating in a challenging global environment. Through the execution of our strategies, we've successfully grown long-term value environment over the years regardless of the environment. Our long-term fundamentals that drove our performance are stronger than ever. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, our alignment with long-term consumer trends that are in our favor and the attractive categories we are in, provide a strong foundation for long-term sustainable growth. We're confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders.  Now let's turn to your questions.\nOperator:  And our first question today will be coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: McCormick reiterated its full year outlook, right, despite a worsening in inflation outlook and still dynamic operating environment. And as you noted, now requires an even more significant margin inflection in the back half of the year to stay within sort of your full year gross margin guidance. So I was hoping you could speak a little bit to what gives you the visibility that is playing out. And I know you detailed some items on the last call, such as pricing and lapping COVID costs, smoother cadence of ERP spend and CCI saves and such. So perhaps you can remind us of these and share if there are any additions or changes to the above?\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Andrew. I'll start on this and then let Mike follow up and talk about those specific items. But first of all, I want to emphasize that first quarter is really right up in the middle with our expectations. And it all starts with strong demand and strong top line performance. We expect to see continued strong demand as we go through the year. And as we go through the second quarter, in particular, more pricing action goes into effect, which on top of that strong demand and with the relatively low elasticity that we're seeing will translate into both strong top line and strong bottom line growth in the second half of the year. This is in line with the guidance that we talked about on our last call at the end of -- when we gave guidance for the year initially.  Mike, you want to talk about those specific guidance.\nMike Smith: Yes. I think the thing that's really changed since the first quarter for the year-end call when we talked about the inflation moving from mid-teens to mid to high teens. Really, there's been a bit of an acceleration in things like fuel cost that will impact our second quarter. But we see on average across the year, that cost inflation around the same mid- to high single teens, but it's been moved forward into the second quarter. Pricing, though, is continuing to build, as Lawrence said.  For the full year, before we said on the last call, mid- to high pricing impact, we're at the high -- we'll be at the high end of that now. And actually, in the second 6, we'll be in a low double-digit pricing impact range, which gives us more confidence about the second half profit realization. As you mentioned, there were some other factors. ERP spending is up in the first versus last year. Investments in supply chain, we just announced some of the transition of production over to the Peterborough facility in the U.K. There are start-up costs that have hit us in the first quarter. There will be more of that in the second quarter, really hitting the Flavor Solutions segment. So we do see some of those negative impacts in Q2, but really feel confident about the second 6 with some of the actions that we've identified.\nAndrew Lazar: And then just quickly, you've talked about the capacity coming online. And I think you mentioned you shipped essentially or closer to consumption this quarter, so sort of making progress there, and we've seen that in the market share improvements. But it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve yet had the ability to sort of really re-build retail or inventories. And I assume there's still some opportunity for that as you go forward through this year? And perhaps you could just update us on that.\nLawrence Kurzius: I think that this is a work in progress. Supply chain continues to get better. It's not perfect as our -- some of our customers will remind us. But the disruptions that we are seeing are much more discrete and specific rather than the third quarter of last year, it seemed like everything was a problem. So supply chain has gotten better, our ability to meet that demand has really gotten better. And although make that remark about certain customers a minute ago. The fact is our customers tell us that, generally, we are performing better than our competitive set, and this is allowing us to win new business. So we really feel pretty good about how that has improved. And I think you'll continue to see us build share performance consecutively as we have been for the last several quarters with our ability to supply, and that additional capacity coming on has really made the difference.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask, first of all, about the private label dynamics because we're looking at the level of price inflation really across the grocery store. And under normal circumstances, you would expect to trade down to private label. But I know that you mentioned that your private label sales are actually down year-on-year. I'm just wondering what's driving that. Is it supply chain related? Is it retail-driven? Or is it simply that consumers are feeling -- still feeling reasonably flash and able to afford the branded products? And then I have a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. I think 2 things. First of all, we have not yet seen significant movement in private label as a trend in either direction. Some of the recent market data shows some increase and -- but it's really slight in our categories. There's a dynamic you have to watch out for private label, the costs are going up for everybody. And it's driven by raw material, packaging and transportation, and the same penny cost increase that's impacting brands is also impacting private label. And so when you put that same amount of cost increase through to private label, percent of increase is bigger, and it creates an uptick of private label growing faster on a dollar basis. It's again, it's that cost pass-through. So I want to make that clear. The second point that I want to make, though, is that we are believers that there's a role for both our brand and private label, especially in the urban spice category and we provide both to our customers and the best competitive environment for us as a company. It's when both our brand and private label are obtaining share, putting pressure on everybody else.\nAlexia Howard: Great. and as a follow-up, obviously, Russia and Ukraine is a very difficult situation right now. Can you share what percentage of sales that is to you? I'm pretty sure it's fairly low. But what do you see as the risks around the world if the situation persists? And I'm really talking about when we've gone through previous commodity cycles, we've seen problems because of the inaffordability of basic food stuff like bread in Egypt and so on. Would your supply chain -- I mean, given what you've seen in the past when we see these grain cycles, are there particular ingredients that you think might be more challenged? I'm just trying to get at the risks there.\nMike Smith: Alexia. It's Mike. I'll start the answer. We have said in our 8-K, sales for Russia and Ukraine are less than 1% of our total sales. So that's -- and so that's grossed in. It will have an impact in the second quarter, obviously, because that's when the crisis has unfolded. As far as your question about broader impacts, primarily inflation, I think you've seen in the last couple of weeks, and part of the reasons we've taken our inflation expectations up and discussed pricing is because of some of those impacts.  From a commodity perspective, I mean, our market basket is a lot different than a lot of other food companies. I mean there are products that could be impacted, we source mustard from that part of the world, but we have secondary sourcing capabilities there, which we've moved to. So I think our global supply chain, 1 of the strengths we have is it's deep and has a long history and there's alternative markets for a lot of our materials. And no one raw material makes up more than 5% of our total cost of goods sold. So I think that diversity really helps us.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I would say we're less exposed to the green complex. Most of our peer companies would be. I think our concern and part of what we're considering in our inflationary outlook is cost of energy, which now looks like it's going to remain higher than perhaps it might have otherwise. That flows through the packaging to the plastic resins and things like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of  with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: In light of some of the incremental cost pressures you're facing, the year-on-year decline we saw in the first quarter gross margin, is this a reasonable level of decline to think about in the second quarter as well? Or was -- where should we think about the first quarter as the low point in terms of progression?\nMike Smith: I'd say between the first half and the second half, you're going to have that big change due to the pricing dynamic I mentioned before and some of the one-timers in the first 6. The things we've laid out as far as cost increasing versus our original expectations in the second quarter. I think it's probably a pretty good estimate that in that range of gross margin, what we did in the first quarter is probably close. We do have the additional Peterburg supply chain investment costs I talked about for dual running costs and things like that. So I don't think you're far out of the ballpark there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to switch to -- ask about pricing in consumer EMEA. The pricing remained like fairly muted in the quarter. So can you walk us through what to expect from pricing in this region as the year progresses? And what some of the challenges are, if any, to taking pricing here?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I'd say that we've said we're going to take pricing as appropriate. And so different regions are going to have different levels of inflationary impact and different levels of pricing and different timings in which those pricing actions might take effect. And so I don't -- and then even within regions, there are going to be differences from country to country, especially in the region.\nMike Smith: Even within the segments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Even within our segments, certainly, I can say though that broadly, we have -- our current pricing actions -- our pricing actions that we've spoken about are very much on track. We have pricing going into effect in second quarter in several markets. I know your question is about the EMEA, but they'll be more specific about our U.S. consumer business because increases are going into effect this week for the next round. In our Flavor Solutions segment, broadly, the branded foodservice part of the portfolio moves with consumer pricing. And the rest of the flavor solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows and the timing is going to vary tremendously based on the windows of reassessing the pricing. And I'd say that in EMEA and APZ, the pricing actions are on track and are going to be phased in through the first half of the year. So it is -- pricing is always an ongoing discussion, and we would not get too specific as of now for both the customer and for competitive reasons.\nMike Smith: Yes, I think you'll see the same trends across the regions that pricing will build during the year.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Thanks for the question. I guess it's in 2 parts. I wanted to confirm what I heard about the level of pricing you think, Mike, that will show up in your P&L by the end of the year. I thought I heard you say low teens, but I could have gotten that wrong. Is it scaling up that much? And then the second part is, I think, Laurence, you said that you're operating from a higher baseline because you brought in a lot of consumers to the franchise and the category has expanded perhaps structurally. But the category is declining in the U.S. modestly. It's declining a lot in Europe from what I can tell. Is there a risk here that as consumers regain more mobility and they're gaining it very quickly right now that the consumer category might not be at the right baseline that there might be a lower baseline out there than what you would expect\nLawrence Kurzius: Rob, but I think we'll start with the pricing -- \nMike Smith: Let me answer that. When I say then, just to be clear, we have given guidance that pricing for the full year was going to be mid to high single digit based on -- with the new based on the -- we're moving to the high end of that based on the price -- based on the recent cost increases. Obviously, single digit. I'm getting confused. Mid to high single digit. We moved to high based on some of this recent cost inflation, I talked about primarily impacting the second quarter. When I said about first half, second half, in the second half, if you look at that in particular, back to Andrew's question, we are going to see low single -- low double-digit price increases, which are cumulatively coming through for the third and fourth quarter. So it builds during the year, to my point before, not for the full year but for the second 6.\nRobert Moskow: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's a big price increase in the back half of the year.\nMike Smith: Well, I think you're lapping and you're lapping last year in the Americas, particularly pricing in the fourth quarter last year. So you do get that cumulative impact of several price increases, 3 of them actually.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then the risk to the baseline?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, of course, there was elevated demand because consumers were forced to stay at home to cook. And we never expected all of it to remain. But we do believe that consumers have moved to a higher level of consumption and at a higher level of cooking at home structurally. All of our research points in that direction. Just the logic of people still cooking at home.And it starts from working from home in part. Lunch is going to be a meal occasion. That is consumed more at home. The breakfast because of work from home, people are actually cooking breakfast instead of using more ready-to-eat solutions. And there's kind of both the qualitative and the quantitative work at that point to say consumption at home is going to continue to remain elevated. I mean 88% of consumers say they're going to cook as much at home or as much or more at home than they did during the pandemic.  To the extent there's economic pressure on us from a recession, that also reinforces the whole cook at home. And we know, in particular, our categories and our brands performed well during processionary periods during both of the last 2 recessions. Our brand growth was right in line with our long-term guidance. We are seeing a difference in our consumer business in the U.S. versus Europe. But the biggest factor there is actually that Europe has -- in our European business, we have a significant component that is making, particularly with our Botanical brand in France. And so we've seen baking return to more of a baseline level. But we do believe that there's been a step up in our other categories.\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean you just look at total McCormick consumer in the last 2 years, we were lapping a really tough quarter last year in Q1. We're up 30% in 2 years constant currency consumer sales. That's pretty amazing. That's that step-up that Lawrence was talking about.\nRobert Moskow: And maybe 1 last follow-up, if I could. If pricing is up low double digit, let's say, it's like 12% in the back half of the year. It's probably not unheard of to expect a volume decline of like negative 5%, negative 6%. Is that close to how you're thinking about elasticity? Number one. And if volume is that -- down that much, does that have any implications for your fixed cost leverage? Or what does it do to your -- the rest of your P&L, if anything?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I'm not going to get too specific on our exact elasticity modeling. But we do model elasticity. These price increases are really outside the range of those models. And the environment is different from the environment in which those models were built. So I think that all of us are in a little bit uncharted territory right now. But we've assumed a level of elasticity is so far so good in the sense that elasticity that we're actually seeing is actually at the low end of what we've been modeling. So that gives us some encouragement.  And again, elasticity is probably based on substitutability and everything is going up. And so kind of -- even though our prices are going up, the consumers\u2019 perspective about the kind of relative frame of preference, it's in a context for all the substitutes and everything that products are used on it's going up as well. And again, as we tried to say in our prepared remarks and which we've seen and heard from consumers in the past is that our products are a very small part of the cost of their meal. And in many cases, are part of them solving their whole grocery basket inflation problem. They've got a NIM going up 40% the increase on spices sales by comparison and using even more spice to substitute a lower cost got to meet a real behavior that we see in consumer.\nMike Smith: Let's read about the fixed cost in our supply chain. I mean we manage ups and downs all the time. So if there happens to be some volume decrease there's been a large investment in capacity in the last couple of years and we've gotten out a lot of these co-pack costs from COVID. So we would absorb that.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. And I would say we're still -- in order to meet the high level of demand the volumes came down a little bit, it actually won't even benefit us.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I was hoping to dig in on the Flavor Solutions growth a little bit and really trying to think about the performance in some of the different buckets and very different comp layout in that part of the business than in the consumer segment, where you were still lapping some easy foodservice and quick service comps a year ago. Those get notably tougher, your packaged food customers, especially in North America might kind of -- or probably wrestle with a lot of the same demand elasticity questions that Rob and others have been asking about already. So I'm just trying to think about how we should think about the volume growth, whether it's by region or by the different parts of that business over the balance of the year?\nLawrence Kurzius: I'll start off to say that Flavor Solutions growth for the total company was really strong. And for Americas and EMEA, it was likewise really, really strong. And even Asia Pacific and where the growth was a little bit lighter, I'm not going to complain about the amount of growth that we recognize over there as well. The food away from home components, slightly trailed food at home overall, but those results were really different by region. That whole \u2013 our whole flavor and seasoning business has really been robust in the Americas, and that drove a lot of the growth. And quick service restaurant recovery has continued to be strong. And branded food service is now reopening. So we're seeing solid growth there. I mean it's hard to say what's not, -- I mean, I couldn't tell you what we're not growing.\nMike Smith: Yes, not only the secular trends, but we're winning business. I mean it's the thing that we talked about -- 1 acquisition that has unlocked across the flavor business and some of these high-growing categories, we talked about it in CAGNY. So I think you're seeing a lot of good trends across Flavor Solutions.\nAdam Samuelson: Right. I know I get that. I'm just trying to think about this on the go forward, the comp layout on volumes is just very different from an activity level than our consumer business. And I'm trying to think about, especially if there's risks of maybe a bit lower economic growth, especially in EMEA, you got COVID lockdowns in Asia or in China specifically, just how do we -- how you're thinking about that business as we go into the balance of the year?\nMike Smith: Well, I think -- Gosh. I mean all companies are struggling like this. But I think in times when other of our, say, package food companies are trying to come up with innovation, maybe take cost out where our products are such a small percentage of the total product they sell to the consumer, it's actually an opportunity for us to work with them. So I'm less concerned about some of the elasticity they're seeing, things like that. You've said we're small component, just like on the consumer side of that meal, whether you're a branded foodservice or whether you're buying a snack seasoning.\nLawrence Kurzius: And on China specifically, we're watching this. But I'd say it's within the -- there are always puts and takes in pressures within the business. I'd say that what we're seeing at least so far is within that range.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then -- and if I quickly follow up on the commodity cost inflation point, and I appreciate your basket looks very different than a lot of other food companies. You guys also are much more diverse just in terms of despite the seasoning herbs that are going to have a lot of emerging market kind of growers, very smallholder farmers. Can you talk about the contracting of that? How much when you actually will agree to price with those growers through the year? Just they're going to be facing some pretty dramatic input cost inflation. I'm wondering how that will impact the price that you're paying for that basket of commodities, is that really more of a fiscal '23 event as we think about their costs throwing up to your return -- \nMike Smith: I think most -- the impact we've talked about, especially recently is more on the transportation and the packaging side. There's exposures to the resins and oil costs and things like that. Input commodities, we have a long history of relationships with partners and joint ventures that secure commodities over time. And you can look at our balance sheet, we have more raw materials now than we did last year. So that's part of the way we protect our future supply.\nLawrence Kurzius: Right. And I think that we couldn\u2019t get into too much detail here. I would say that our global sourcing and our foods on the ground and our long relationships with producers in these markets and kind of the strategic partnership that in some cases are multigenerational have really advantaged us in this area and this has actually been an area that -- where I think that we've demonstrated tremendous competitive advantage and is giving us some buffer and I think that others are probably experiencing even greater cost inflation pressure for some of these same components. It is an area where scale really matters.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Perhaps, building on your comments in response to Alexia's question on private label and Rob's questions as well, it seems there's an increased focus in your comments this morning on entry price points for affordability maybe that just limited the private label, but generally and value offerings such as the larger pack sizes. I guess I just want to validate that I'm picking up on a fair evolution in tone since the start of the year, number one. And then number two, maybe some comments around how that's altered your outlook for volume versus product mix alongside the increases in pricing. Clearly, you haven't altered the top line outlook and you've mentioned the incremental price anticipated so we can solve for the difference. But within that, I'm curious how you're thinking about volume versus mix trade-offs. It sounds like you expect the response to skew more towards mix versus a unit volume decline. But I just want to validate that and would love some incremental thoughts.\nMike Smith: I mean I'll start with this. There's a lot to unpack. I mean the nice thing in our consumer business is, whether you're buying recipe mixes or bottles of spices or Frank's RedHot Sauce, the margins are very solid. So we have a real -- we have a broad -- for all portfolio of products of Flavor things, but really high-margin business across the board. So I don't think -- I don't think there's going to be an impact there from a shift. I mean you may see in previous recessions, like we've talked about, I don't think we're shifting the message. I think we've talked about very consistently in the recessionary periods such as 2001, 2009, our products do really well. We show volume growth and pricing growth that we need to. So there may be a shift in products from gourmet to recipe mixes because people are going down the value chain, but the margins are there and the use of the 1 pack of dry seasoning mix versus a bottle actually helps us in some way. So I don't -- I think the fear that you're raising isn't fair, right?\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, we're not trying to signal anything when we talk about it. We offer the whole range of price points from all the way from super premium and to mid-tier to entry price point. And at a time when, when we -- and everybody are taking pricing actions, we also want to make sure that our products are accessible to lower-income consumers and value-conscious consumer. And that's how we're really trying to provide reassurance in that area. It's not an anticipation of some change or it's not a shift in strategy or focus for us.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: Just had a couple of quick questions. I think these have become pretty much follow-ups at this point, but just to be clear on a couple of points. But given the higher inflationary outlook, you mentioned you do have more pricing coming online in the second quarter. Is that new pricing? Or is that pricing that was expected to pick up from some of your actions, I think you put in place in the fourth quarter.\nLawrence Kurzius: I can tell you, we -- this is pricing that has been planned. We -- these price increases in order for them to be effective now were presented before our last call, I can assure you, so these are not new. And the additional pricing that we're planning later in the year was planned, the magnitude of that pricing was still flexible and we're locking that in now.\nChris Growe: Okay. Got it. And then I just want to be clear on the cost inflation, that accelerates in the second quarter. Even though pricing\u2019s accelerating, it sounds like there\u2019s going to be some extra cost, so there\u2019d be ERP and the new -- and the facility costs in peers forward. That would be factors that would keep the gross margin from including much sequentially, but the second half should show that improvement as more of the pricing comes through. Is that the right way to think about that between pricing inflation?\nMike Smith: For second half as I said, for the reasons you mentioned, but also the fact that, that cost acceleration for the fuel costs and things like that into the second quarter in addition to some of the things we made out before with some of the supply chain. So yes, you're right.\nChris Growe: Okay. And I just got a question -- go ahead, sorry.\nLawrence Kurzius: I would just say I think you got it.\nChris Growe: Okay. Great. One quick question on Flavor Solutions. You talked about some strategic investment spending. Is that related to future demand? Or is that related to Peterborough, for example, are things you're moving around? I'm just curious what that referred to.\nMike Smith: That's specifically reflecting -- the majority of it is related to the Peterborough start-up costs and redundant running costs there.\nChris Growe: Okay.\nMike Smith: Which is a great new facility of net carbon 0 and manufacturing and then running, it's going to be fantastic long term, but there is a start-up cost, yes.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Just wanted to circle back, I think, to some comments you made maybe a few years ago around China and make sure some of the numbers we're working with are still okay. But I believe, in the past, you've disclosed that China is sub-10% of the business. And I think about half of that business is away from home just as we're thinking about 2Q impact of potential walk-downs.\nLawrence Kurzius: You're right about less than 10%. It's -- I think that's close enough.\nMike Smith: Taken out \u2013 I mean away from at homes, but -- \nLawrence Kurzius: Yes, that's how -- I mean --\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean you have to remember, within our consumer business, we have -- there's products we sell that are used for both -- in foodservice that we classify them as part of the consumer, which is a little different than other parts of the world just because of the fact they could be used in both channels.\nPeter Galbo: Right. Okay. Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, Mike. And I know we've kind of gone over this on the cost inflation side and pricing. But I just -- on reconciling the gross margin guidance specifically for the year, given kind of the hole you're working out of 1Q, some of the lasting impacts in 2Q and not margining up when you take price in the back half of the year, just -- how do you kind of still get to a flat to down 50 basis points gross margin number as you're looking at it internally? Just can you help us there?\nMike Smith: I think you have to remember, first quarter is historically the smallest quarter. So -- and the back half of the year is traditionally our biggest quarter. So there you get a math thing going that helps us as we have increased volumes and pricing and things like that. We've talked about that help fill some of that gap you're talking about. I mean we're always looking -- we talked at CAGNY, we talked on the earnings call about the things that are going to help us, whether it's CCI. People forget about the reduction in COVID costs.  We spent $60 million in COVID costs last year, of which some of that still remains in the underlying business, but that was -- that's a big tailwind for us to help offset some of the segment mix we've talked about, the pricing compression that we've talked about, which is the main driver. So there's other things we're doing, whether it's rev management, to shift to higher-margin products, both on the Flavor Solutions side and Consumer that we're intentionally doing. So there's a lot of things -- there's a lot of puts and takes within that 0 to 50% -- or 50 basis points for the full year. But we're 1 quarter in, and it's just too early to move. And things will move in that range, too, as things change with Ukraine and Russia, commodity costs, pricing. So we're comfortable with where we are right now.\nOperator: I'll now turn the floor right to Lawrence Kurzius for closing remarks.\nLawrence Kurzius: Great. Thank you. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and reach of our balanced portfolio, which has positioned us for sustainable growth. We're very proud of our solid first quarter operating performance, our disciplined and our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to accelerate our momentum and drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence. Thank you to everybody for joining today's call. If you have any further questions about today's information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes this morning's call. Have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I go to business, it is with great sadness that I mention the passing of Buzz McCormick, who is 1 of the most beloved and admired leaders in McCormick's history. Buzz's career at McCormic span 50 years rising through the ranks across many functions becoming President and CEO in 1987 and serving as Chairman of the Board for a total of 11 years until his retirement for the third time in 1999. As CEO, Buzz focused McCormick on flavor by divesting noncore businesses and driving category leadership in spices and seasonings, setting the course for McCormick to be the global leader in flavor. Notably, McCormick's market cap grew by 4x under his leadership.  Buzz will not only be remembered for his enduring legacy of performance but just as importantly, for his deep commitment to the well-being of all McCormick employees. He truly made McCormick a great place to work, leaving his biggest accomplishment as a CEO is helping all McCormick employees have a better life. Today, as we reflect on his life and its contributions, we know that his legacy will live on. He has inspired many generations of McCormick leaders with his passion for people, focus on flavor and commitment to delivering shareholder value. Next, I'd like to comment on the situation in Ukraine. First and foremost, we extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine and hope for an immediate end to the conflict and the suffering of innocent people. As we previously announced, we suspended our operations in Russia in mid-March. Our operations in Ukraine have been paused to focus on the safety of our employees and their families. Our thoughts are with the people impacted by these tragic events, particularly our employees who we continue to support through aid in humanitarian efforts we're donating to the Polish Center for International Aid and the World Centre for Pigeon. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to our EMEA employees, especially those in Poland for their many personal efforts in aiding their Ukrainian neighbors in need. Their actions epitomize our power of people principle. Now moving to Slide 4 and our business results. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategies and the engagement of employees. We are confident our strong year-to-date momentum will continue to drive strong performance throughout 2022. In the first quarter, we grew sales 3% or 4% in constant currency on top of our 20% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year, demonstrating again the strength of our product offering and broad global portfolio, which drives differentiated growth and consistency in our performance. Consumer segment sales, while lapping high year ago demand continued to reflect the sustained shift to higher at-home consumption compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our Flavor Solutions segment growth was driven by outstanding growth with our packaged food and beverage customers as well as robust demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers due in part to recovery from curtailed away-from-home dining in the year ago period. Through the breadth and reach of our balanced flavor portfolio, we are meeting the global demand for flavor and delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products we are end-to-end flavor. Adjusted operating income was down 14% or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share was down 13%. As anticipated, the profit driven by our sales growth was more than offset by the well-known and anticipated effects of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges. We have a demonstrated history of successfully navigating through a volatile environment, and we expect to do the same through this high current inflationary period using pricing and other levers to offset cost pressures, which is reflected in our 2022 profit outlook. Now for more on our first quarter segment performance. Starting with the Consumer segment on Slide 5. Growth in the Americas was more than offset by lower sales in the EMEA and APZ regions. Total Consumer segment sales declined 2% against 35% consumer growth in the first quarter of 2021. Given the difficult year-over-year comparison, volume declines were reflected in each region. On a 2-year basis, however, compared to the first quarter of 2020, each region grew sales by double digits. This growth highlights the strength of our categories and importantly, our products as consumers continue to cook more at home, demand for flavor continues to grow. The pricing actions we have taken were also reflected in each region's results, and the elasticity impact we experienced has been lower than historical levels. As we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, and this could be a cumulative effect, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. Turning to highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 2% which follows a 15% consumption increase in the first quarter of 2021. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit consumption growth versus the 2 year ago period. Demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. Our first quarter shipments were in line with consumption, however, some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve as does our share performance with another sequential improvement in the first quarter as we expected. Versus last year, we are beginning to grow our spices and seasoning share and in recipe mixes, we had another quarter of considerable share gain over 4 share points. We continue to see further improvement as we begin the second quarter, and we are confident in our continued momentum. In EMEA during the first quarter, we lapped high prior year demand, partially due to restrictions resulting from COVID resurgences last year while continuing our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our market share performance was stronger this quarter. We maintained our total EMEA region herb, spices and seasoning share on top of strong gains in the first quarters of the last 2 years. Of note, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption 60% and gained significant share versus the 2 year ago period. And in the Asia Pacific region, first quarter growth was tempered by scaled down Chinese New Year celebration due to several cities in China imposing restrictions as a result of new COVID outbreaks.These restrictions impacted our branded food service demand that is included in the consumer segment in China.  Turning to Slide 6. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 12% or 14% in constant currency driven by base business growth, new products and 1 month of incremental sales for our acquisition of FONA in December 2020. All 3 regions contributed to our growth each with higher volume and product mix as well as the pricing actions to partially offset costs. Our first quarter Flavor Solutions results reflect similar market conditions across the region. As a reminder, our customer base in the Americas is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers and in EMEA and APZ to quick service restaurant or QSR customers. Our differentiated customer engagement and technical capabilities continue to drive outstanding growth, both in base business and with new products, with our packaged food and beverage customers or at home customer base. Our performance with these customers led our first quarter Flavor Solutions results with double-digit growth in flavors for Performance Nutrition and health end market applications as well as savory snacks. And our momentum with flavors for alcoholic beverages also continued. Our QSR momentum has been strong with core menu items and limited time offers driving first quarter growth and other restaurant business continues to rebound. Our first quarter results also reflect the lapping of curtailed away-from-home dining last year. The restaurants are benefiting from the shift to takeaway and delivery that was amplified by the pandemic. There's been a blurring between channels and most of the restaurant food being consumed off-premise. For instance, 1 in 4 dinners consumed at home was supplemented with a restaurant or other foodservice items. For our other institutional food service customers and our branded foodservice product category, we expected some recovery coming into 2022, and we saw that demand strengthen in our first quarter and drove growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. Now I'd like to share some comments on our momentum and the growth initiatives we have underway. Turning to Slide 7. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. Our alignment with these trends, in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies sustainably positions us for future growth. In this current dynamic global environment, we remain focused on long-term sustainable growth. We continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges. To partially offset rise in cost we raised prices where appropriate late last year and are currently facing an additional pricing actions. And as costs have continued to accelerate, we will raise prices again this year where appropriate. We appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have successfully grown and compounded our growth regardless of the environment and plan to do so again in 2022 as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. In our Consumer segment, across our major measured markets, we have gained millions of households over the last 2 years and had double-digit buyer rate growth. Our brands have gained new consumers, and we have driven increased usage at the same time. This performance, combined with billions of additional at-home eating occasions from consumers cooking more at home has created a new baseline for growth. We are continuing to drive our consumer segment momentum by accelerating flavor usage, including delivering on the demand for heat, building confidence in the kitchen and inspiring flavor exploration. We're also strengthening our consumer relationships at every point of purchase and creating a delicious, healthy and sustainable future. We are fueling growth through our brand marketing investments, category management initiatives and new products. Our brand marketing is resonating with consumers, particularly as we connect with them online. And as we expand the capabilities of our marketing excellence organization globally, we're gaining efficiencies, executing with greater speed and shifting our investments to work in dollars to drive greater effectiveness. Our U.S. spice aisle reinvention is further driving our category leadership with growth for McCormick and our customers. This initiative is continuing this year with additional stores being implemented and we're also starting to build momentum with similar initiatives in Canada, the U.K. and France. Our consumer new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. Our new products are focused on what's important to consumers, such as freshness, modern packaging, convenience and flavor exploration as well as affordability and value. 75% of global consumers find it more economical to cook at home. And in the current inflationary environment, it resonates even more now. Our products are already part of the consumer solution to manage inflation across their whole grocery basket. For instance, inflation is hitting the meat case hard and a little bit of our flavor can make less impressive meat, more palatable and make the consumers whole meal both more affordable and fiber. We have products at all price points that attract many types of consumers and households as well as different income levels. We continue to focus on ensuring we're launching new products that appeal to all types of consumers such as additional entry-level price points for affordability as well as value offerings, including larger sizes to meet the needs of price-conscious consumers. And with our new products and recipes tailored, the popular new appliances such as air fryers and Instant Pot, we are providing consumers flavor inspiration and greater convenience when using our products. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we plan to continue migrating our portfolio to more value-added products and technically insulated products, particularly our Flavor product category. We're targeting opportunities to grow with our customers in attractive, high-growth end markets such as alcoholic beverages, savory snacks and Performance Nutrition.We have been outpacing the market growth in these categories. They all contributed towards a strong growth in our first quarter results and further migrate our portfolio. Following a record year of new product growth last year, we are excited about our robust 2022 pipeline of culinary inspired innovation. We are leveraging our broad technology platform to develop clean label, organic and better-for-you solutions to some of our customers' issues without compromising on taste. We're using Sage, our AI-enabled product development tool to develop consumer preferred flavors at an increased speed that have a track record for lasting longer in the market for our customers. And we are building a pipeline of opportunities to accelerate our global seasoning growth by expanding our mid-tier customer base being added to core supplier list and strengthening our leadership in heat. We plan to continue to drive flavor solutions growth through a differentiated customer engagement. We have a strong passion for creating a flawless customer experience. Across both segments, our installed sales and growth plans bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory. We also recognize we are operating in a challenging global environment. Before Mike reiterates our guidance in a few moments, I'd like to comment on some current conditions. We will continue to monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine very closely and adapt accordingly. Cost inflation has remained persistent with recent escalation in some areas such as transportation costs. And as such, we have raised our cost inflation guidance. It is now a mid- to high-teen increase. And in regard to COVID, as I mentioned earlier, there are new COVID restrictions being imposed in several cities in China. We are continually assessing the dynamics of these conditions as they involve we recognize there will be some near-term impact, which we expect to mitigate later in the year, in part with additional pricing actions. We are well positioned to deliver another strong year of growth and performance in 2022 and through the effective execution of our strategy and with a robust operating momentum. In addition to delivering top-tier financial results, we are also committed to doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. We recently released our 2021 purpose-led performance progress report, which highlights our key initiatives and the progress we are making, including our recent announcements on the update of our science-based targets, reduced greenhouse gas submissions by 2030, aligning with the United Nations 1.5 degree Celsius target as well as our commitment to net zero by 2050. As we move forward in 2022, we are excited to continue to share our progress and success on all our purpose-led performance goals. Now for some summary comments on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike. The combination of our strong business model, the investments we have made, the capabilities we have built and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are actively responding to changing market conditions, consumer behaviors and customer needs while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing environment. We have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate in today's environment responding with agility to volatility and disruption while remaining focused on the long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. Through the execution of our strategy that are designed to drive long-term value, we have grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years, regardless of the environment. Our fundamentals that drove that performance and our momentum and outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment, their agility and teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. We delivered solid first quarter results in line with our expectations with strong sales growth on top of our 20% constant currency growth last year. We are confident that the hard work and dedication of our employees will continue to drive momentum. We recognize we're operating in a challenging global environment. Through the execution of our strategies, we've successfully grown long-term value environment over the years regardless of the environment. Our long-term fundamentals that drove our performance are stronger than ever. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, our alignment with long-term consumer trends that are in our favor and the attractive categories we are in, provide a strong foundation for long-term sustainable growth. We're confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders.  Now let's turn to your questions. Thanks, Andrew. I'll start on this and then let Mike follow up and talk about those specific items. But first of all, I want to emphasize that first quarter is really right up in the middle with our expectations. And it all starts with strong demand and strong top line performance. We expect to see continued strong demand as we go through the year. And as we go through the second quarter, in particular, more pricing action goes into effect, which on top of that strong demand and with the relatively low elasticity that we're seeing will translate into both strong top line and strong bottom line growth in the second half of the year. This is in line with the guidance that we talked about on our last call at the end of -- when we gave guidance for the year initially.  Mike, you want to talk about those specific guidance. I think that this is a work in progress. Supply chain continues to get better. It's not perfect as our -- some of our customers will remind us. But the disruptions that we are seeing are much more discrete and specific rather than the third quarter of last year, it seemed like everything was a problem. So supply chain has gotten better, our ability to meet that demand has really gotten better. And although make that remark about certain customers a minute ago. The fact is our customers tell us that, generally, we are performing better than our competitive set, and this is allowing us to win new business. So we really feel pretty good about how that has improved. And I think you'll continue to see us build share performance consecutively as we have been for the last several quarters with our ability to supply, and that additional capacity coming on has really made the difference. Sure. I think 2 things. First of all, we have not yet seen significant movement in private label as a trend in either direction. Some of the recent market data shows some increase and -- but it's really slight in our categories. There's a dynamic you have to watch out for private label, the costs are going up for everybody. And it's driven by raw material, packaging and transportation, and the same penny cost increase that's impacting brands is also impacting private label. And so when you put that same amount of cost increase through to private label, percent of increase is bigger, and it creates an uptick of private label growing faster on a dollar basis. It's again, it's that cost pass-through. So I want to make that clear. The second point that I want to make, though, is that we are believers that there's a role for both our brand and private label, especially in the urban spice category and we provide both to our customers and the best competitive environment for us as a company. It's when both our brand and private label are obtaining share, putting pressure on everybody else. And I would say we're less exposed to the green complex. Most of our peer companies would be. I think our concern and part of what we're considering in our inflationary outlook is cost of energy, which now looks like it's going to remain higher than perhaps it might have otherwise. That flows through the packaging to the plastic resins and things like that. Well, I'd say that we've said we're going to take pricing as appropriate. And so different regions are going to have different levels of inflationary impact and different levels of pricing and different timings in which those pricing actions might take effect. And so I don't -- and then even within regions, there are going to be differences from country to country, especially in the region. Even within our segments, certainly, I can say though that broadly, we have -- our current pricing actions -- our pricing actions that we've spoken about are very much on track. We have pricing going into effect in second quarter in several markets. I know your question is about the EMEA, but they'll be more specific about our U.S. consumer business because increases are going into effect this week for the next round. In our Flavor Solutions segment, broadly, the branded foodservice part of the portfolio moves with consumer pricing. And the rest of the flavor solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows and the timing is going to vary tremendously based on the windows of reassessing the pricing. And I'd say that in EMEA and APZ, the pricing actions are on track and are going to be phased in through the first half of the year. So it is -- pricing is always an ongoing discussion, and we would not get too specific as of now for both the customer and for competitive reasons. Rob, but I think we'll start with the pricing -- Well, of course, there was elevated demand because consumers were forced to stay at home to cook. And we never expected all of it to remain. But we do believe that consumers have moved to a higher level of consumption and at a higher level of cooking at home structurally. All of our research points in that direction. Just the logic of people still cooking at home.And it starts from working from home in part. Lunch is going to be a meal occasion. That is consumed more at home. The breakfast because of work from home, people are actually cooking breakfast instead of using more ready-to-eat solutions. And there's kind of both the qualitative and the quantitative work at that point to say consumption at home is going to continue to remain elevated. I mean 88% of consumers say they're going to cook as much at home or as much or more at home than they did during the pandemic.  To the extent there's economic pressure on us from a recession, that also reinforces the whole cook at home. And we know, in particular, our categories and our brands performed well during processionary periods during both of the last 2 recessions. Our brand growth was right in line with our long-term guidance. We are seeing a difference in our consumer business in the U.S. versus Europe. But the biggest factor there is actually that Europe has -- in our European business, we have a significant component that is making, particularly with our Botanical brand in France. And so we've seen baking return to more of a baseline level. But we do believe that there's been a step up in our other categories. Well, I'm not going to get too specific on our exact elasticity modeling. But we do model elasticity. These price increases are really outside the range of those models. And the environment is different from the environment in which those models were built. So I think that all of us are in a little bit uncharted territory right now. But we've assumed a level of elasticity is so far so good in the sense that elasticity that we're actually seeing is actually at the low end of what we've been modeling. So that gives us some encouragement.  And again, elasticity is probably based on substitutability and everything is going up. And so kind of -- even though our prices are going up, the consumers' perspective about the kind of relative frame of preference, it's in a context for all the substitutes and everything that products are used on it's going up as well. And again, as we tried to say in our prepared remarks and which we've seen and heard from consumers in the past is that our products are a very small part of the cost of their meal. And in many cases, are part of them solving their whole grocery basket inflation problem. They've got a NIM going up 40% the increase on spices sales by comparison and using even more spice to substitute a lower cost got to meet a real behavior that we see in consumer. Yes. And I would say we're still -- in order to meet the high level of demand the volumes came down a little bit, it actually won't even benefit us. I'll start off to say that Flavor Solutions growth for the total company was really strong. And for Americas and EMEA, it was likewise really, really strong. And even Asia Pacific and where the growth was a little bit lighter, I'm not going to complain about the amount of growth that we recognize over there as well. The food away from home components, slightly trailed food at home overall, but those results were really different by region. That whole \u2013 our whole flavor and seasoning business has really been robust in the Americas, and that drove a lot of the growth. And quick service restaurant recovery has continued to be strong. And branded food service is now reopening. So we're seeing solid growth there. I mean it's hard to say what's not, -- I mean, I couldn't tell you what we're not growing. And on China specifically, we're watching this. But I'd say it's within the -- there are always puts and takes in pressures within the business. I'd say that what we're seeing at least so far is within that range. Right. And I think that we couldn't get into too much detail here. I would say that our global sourcing and our foods on the ground and our long relationships with producers in these markets and kind of the strategic partnership that in some cases are multigenerational have really advantaged us in this area and this has actually been an area that -- where I think that we've demonstrated tremendous competitive advantage and is giving us some buffer and I think that others are probably experiencing even greater cost inflation pressure for some of these same components. It is an area where scale really matters. Yes, we're not trying to signal anything when we talk about it. We offer the whole range of price points from all the way from super premium and to mid-tier to entry price point. And at a time when, when we -- and everybody are taking pricing actions, we also want to make sure that our products are accessible to lower-income consumers and value-conscious consumer. And that's how we're really trying to provide reassurance in that area. It's not an anticipation of some change or it's not a shift in strategy or focus for us. I can tell you, we -- this is pricing that has been planned. We -- these price increases in order for them to be effective now were presented before our last call, I can assure you, so these are not new. And the additional pricing that we're planning later in the year was planned, the magnitude of that pricing was still flexible and we're locking that in now. I would just say I think you got it. You're right about less than 10%. It's -- I think that's close enough. Yes, that's how -- I mean -- Great. Thank you. McCormick is differentiated by the breadth and reach of our balanced portfolio, which has positioned us for sustainable growth. We're very proud of our solid first quarter operating performance, our disciplined and our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to accelerate our momentum and drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategies, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We are well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line growth continues to be strong. During the first quarter, we grew constant currency sales 4%, driven by pricing actions across both segments and incremental sales from our FONA acquisition. Consumer segment sales declined 2% in constant currency due to lapping high demand in all 3 regions last year, with a partial offset from pricing. On a 2-year basis, compared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 30% with double-digit growth in all 3 regions, reflecting the sustained shift to at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume of the product mix due to lapping last year's elevated demand. Branded products led the growth with strength in McCormick, Zatarain's, Stubb's, Otay, Simply Asia, Frank's RedHot and French's, partially offset by a decline in private label. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 9% from a year ago, driven by lower volume and product mix, most significantly in Vahine\u0301 homemade dessert products due to lapping last year's high demand across the region. This decline was partially offset by pricing actions. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 6%, driven by the exit of lower-margin business in India. China's consumer and branded foodservice demand partially related to the Chinese New Year impact Laurence mentioned earlier, also contributed to the decline. These declines were partially offset by pricing actions. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew first quarter constant currency sales 14%, including a 2% contribution from incremental FONA sales in December. As a reminder, we acquired FONA on December 30, 2020. The remaining increase was driven by higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 18%, with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 12%, with FONA contributing 2% and the remaining growth due to both pricing and the combination of volume and product mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth with the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing. In the EMEA, we drove 24% constant currency sales growth with a 17% increase in volume and product mix and 7% related to pricing actions. EMEA's growth was led by the robust recovery of demand from QSRs and branded foodservice customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions and growth from higher volume and product mix. This growth was driven by our QSR customers, both in their core menu items as well as their limited time offers and promotional activities. As seen on Slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges declined 14% or in constant currency, 12% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Adjusted operating income declined 12% in the Consumer segment with minimal impact from currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 17% or 11% in constant currency. Both segments were unfavorably impacted by higher inflation and distribution costs. Both of which accelerated in the second half of last year as well as incremental investment spending on our ERP program, which we expected to be higher earlier in 2022 versus 2021. CCI-led cost savings favorably impacted both segments. In the Consumer segment, lower sales, partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19-related costs also contributed to the decline. In the Flavor Solutions segment, higher sales were more than offset by the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned as well as costs related to supply chain investments, which will continue in the second quarter. As seen on Slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This was driven by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the pricing actions we have taken. We estimate the dilutive impact of pricing to offset this dollar inflation increase was approximately 200 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, a sales shift between segments also contributed to the margin decline. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year due to higher distribution costs and a higher level of investment in our ERP program. This, combined with the adjusted gross margin compression, resulted in an adjusted margin decline of 280 basis points, in line with our expectations. Turning to income taxes on Slide 23. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19.7% compared to 22.7% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 30% versus the first quarter of 2021, due to the elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest as well as higher inflation costs impacting our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.72 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an inflow of $18 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to an outflow of $32 million in the first quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by working capital improvements and lower payments for transaction and integration costs related to our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We returned $99 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $44 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 27. First, I would like to provide some additional perspective on some of the current conditions Lawrence mentioned earlier. As we have said, we are currently not operating in Russia and the Ukraine. And while the impact is not fully known, our business in these markets is small with the combined sales across both segments totaling less than 1% of total company sales last year.  Additionally, we have no manufacturing in either country. Any operating profit impact would include those related to the impact on sales as well as potential expenses stemming from the current situation. Regarding cost inflation, we are revising our outlook and are now projecting inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens as compared to mid-teens increase in our previous guidance. We expect cost inflation to remain persistent, especially as it relates to transportation, and we are continuing actions to mitigate these costs, including pricing. Again, as Lawrence mentioned, we recognize these dynamics will have some impacts on our results, certainly in the second quarter. While we continue to monitor impacts on the broader economy and will adapt as necessary we are reiterating our 2022 sales and profit outlook that we previously shared in our January earnings call. We are projecting strong top line growth and operating performance with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. We expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth with volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the cooling of lower margin business from our portfolio. Our 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid- to high-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases, we do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19-related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. As we shared on our last earnings call, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we are phasing in pricing actions and with costs continuing to escalate, we'll raise prices again as appropriate. While we plan to cover the cost pressures due to the recent acceleration of inflation, there will be a lag. And as a result, our profit will now be weighted to the second half of the year, even more than originally expected. And as a reminder, we expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021. Our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind I just mentioned. This resulted in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22 compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. In summary, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue to accelerate our operating momentum and drive another year of strong growth and performance. Yes. I think the thing that's really changed since the first quarter for the year-end call when we talked about the inflation moving from mid-teens to mid to high teens. Really, there's been a bit of an acceleration in things like fuel cost that will impact our second quarter. But we see on average across the year, that cost inflation around the same mid- to high single teens, but it's been moved forward into the second quarter. Pricing, though, is continuing to build, as Lawrence said.  For the full year, before we said on the last call, mid- to high pricing impact, we're at the high -- we'll be at the high end of that now. And actually, in the second 6, we'll be in a low double-digit pricing impact range, which gives us more confidence about the second half profit realization. As you mentioned, there were some other factors. ERP spending is up in the first versus last year. Investments in supply chain, we just announced some of the transition of production over to the Peterborough facility in the U.K. There are start-up costs that have hit us in the first quarter. There will be more of that in the second quarter, really hitting the Flavor Solutions segment. So we do see some of those negative impacts in Q2, but really feel confident about the second 6 with some of the actions that we've identified. Alexia. It's Mike. I'll start the answer. We have said in our 8-K, sales for Russia and Ukraine are less than 1% of our total sales. So that's -- and so that's grossed in. It will have an impact in the second quarter, obviously, because that's when the crisis has unfolded. As far as your question about broader impacts, primarily inflation, I think you've seen in the last couple of weeks, and part of the reasons we've taken our inflation expectations up and discussed pricing is because of some of those impacts.  From a commodity perspective, I mean, our market basket is a lot different than a lot of other food companies. I mean there are products that could be impacted, we source mustard from that part of the world, but we have secondary sourcing capabilities there, which we've moved to. So I think our global supply chain, 1 of the strengths we have is it's deep and has a long history and there's alternative markets for a lot of our materials. And no one raw material makes up more than 5% of our total cost of goods sold. So I think that diversity really helps us. I'd say between the first half and the second half, you're going to have that big change due to the pricing dynamic I mentioned before and some of the one-timers in the first 6. The things we've laid out as far as cost increasing versus our original expectations in the second quarter. I think it's probably a pretty good estimate that in that range of gross margin, what we did in the first quarter is probably close. We do have the additional Peterburg supply chain investment costs I talked about for dual running costs and things like that. So I don't think you're far out of the ballpark there. Even within the segments. Yes, I think you'll see the same trends across the regions that pricing will build during the year. Let me answer that. When I say then, just to be clear, we have given guidance that pricing for the full year was going to be mid to high single digit based on -- with the new based on the -- we're moving to the high end of that based on the price -- based on the recent cost increases. Obviously, single digit. I'm getting confused. Mid to high single digit. We moved to high based on some of this recent cost inflation, I talked about primarily impacting the second quarter. When I said about first half, second half, in the second half, if you look at that in particular, back to Andrew's question, we are going to see low single -- low double-digit price increases, which are cumulatively coming through for the third and fourth quarter. So it builds during the year, to my point before, not for the full year but for the second 6. Well, I think you're lapping and you're lapping last year in the Americas, particularly pricing in the fourth quarter last year. So you do get that cumulative impact of several price increases, 3 of them actually. Yes. I mean you just look at total McCormick consumer in the last 2 years, we were lapping a really tough quarter last year in Q1. We're up 30% in 2 years constant currency consumer sales. That's pretty amazing. That's that step-up that Lawrence was talking about. Let's read about the fixed cost in our supply chain. I mean we manage ups and downs all the time. So if there happens to be some volume decrease there's been a large investment in capacity in the last couple of years and we've gotten out a lot of these co-pack costs from COVID. So we would absorb that. Yes, not only the secular trends, but we're winning business. I mean it's the thing that we talked about -- 1 acquisition that has unlocked across the flavor business and some of these high-growing categories, we talked about it in CAGNY. So I think you're seeing a lot of good trends across Flavor Solutions. Well, I think -- Gosh. I mean all companies are struggling like this. But I think in times when other of our, say, package food companies are trying to come up with innovation, maybe take cost out where our products are such a small percentage of the total product they sell to the consumer, it's actually an opportunity for us to work with them. So I'm less concerned about some of the elasticity they're seeing, things like that. You've said we're small component, just like on the consumer side of that meal, whether you're a branded foodservice or whether you're buying a snack seasoning. I think most -- the impact we've talked about, especially recently is more on the transportation and the packaging side. There's exposures to the resins and oil costs and things like that. Input commodities, we have a long history of relationships with partners and joint ventures that secure commodities over time. And you can look at our balance sheet, we have more raw materials now than we did last year. So that's part of the way we protect our future supply. I mean I'll start with this. There's a lot to unpack. I mean the nice thing in our consumer business is, whether you're buying recipe mixes or bottles of spices or Frank's RedHot Sauce, the margins are very solid. So we have a real -- we have a broad -- for all portfolio of products of Flavor things, but really high-margin business across the board. So I don't think -- I don't think there's going to be an impact there from a shift. I mean you may see in previous recessions, like we've talked about, I don't think we're shifting the message. I think we've talked about very consistently in the recessionary periods such as 2001, 2009, our products do really well. We show volume growth and pricing growth that we need to. So there may be a shift in products from gourmet to recipe mixes because people are going down the value chain, but the margins are there and the use of the 1 pack of dry seasoning mix versus a bottle actually helps us in some way. So I don't -- I think the fear that you're raising isn't fair, right? For second half as I said, for the reasons you mentioned, but also the fact that, that cost acceleration for the fuel costs and things like that into the second quarter in addition to some of the things we made out before with some of the supply chain. So yes, you're right. That's specifically reflecting -- the majority of it is related to the Peterborough start-up costs and redundant running costs there. Which is a great new facility of net carbon 0 and manufacturing and then running, it's going to be fantastic long term, but there is a start-up cost, yes. Taken out \u2013 I mean away from at homes, but -- Yes. I mean you have to remember, within our consumer business, we have -- there's products we sell that are used for both -- in foodservice that we classify them as part of the consumer, which is a little different than other parts of the world just because of the fact they could be used in both channels. I think you have to remember, first quarter is historically the smallest quarter. So -- and the back half of the year is traditionally our biggest quarter. So there you get a math thing going that helps us as we have increased volumes and pricing and things like that. We've talked about that help fill some of that gap you're talking about. I mean we're always looking -- we talked at CAGNY, we talked on the earnings call about the things that are going to help us, whether it's CCI. People forget about the reduction in COVID costs.  We spent $60 million in COVID costs last year, of which some of that still remains in the underlying business, but that was -- that's a big tailwind for us to help offset some of the segment mix we've talked about, the pricing compression that we've talked about, which is the main driver. So there's other things we're doing, whether it's rev management, to shift to higher-margin products, both on the Flavor Solutions side and Consumer that we're intentionally doing. So there's a lot of things -- there's a lot of puts and takes within that 0 to 50% -- or 50 basis points for the full year. But we're 1 quarter in, and it's just too early to move. And things will move in that range, too, as things change with Ukraine and Russia, commodity costs, pricing. So we're comfortable with where we are right now."

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by sharing what we will cover in the morning's call. I will begin with an overview of our fourth quarter year-over-year results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will briefly reflect on our full year 2023 performance and share our plans and building blocks to improve volume in 2024. Mike will then go into more depth on the fourth quarter financial results and the details of our 2024 financial outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will share some closing comments, including our key priorities as I begin my first full year as CEO. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. I want to start by acknowledging that our top-line results for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations, as volume trends decelerated relative to the third quarter. There was greater-than-expected pressure on the consumer that drove changes in their behavior, which impacted our growth. We did, however, see sequential improvement in several key areas within our portfolio, underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working, as I will highlight in a moment. That said, we do recognize that consumers are exhibiting even more value-seeking behavior, they are increasing shopping trips, reducing basket size and making just-in-time purchases, creating further uncertainty in the consumer environment. I want to be clear that we are dedicated to improving volumes. We have refined our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results, and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, and you should expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Now let's go to our fourth quarter performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 5. In our fourth quarter, sales increased 3%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2%, reflecting a 5% contribution from pricing, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in volume and product mix. As expected, the benefit from the China recovery was fully offset by the impact of our strategic decisions to exit DSD -- Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas, and the exit of a private label product line and the divestiture of a small canning business, which was part of our Giotti Flavor Solutions operations in EMEA.  Starting with where results differed from expectations. In Americas Consumer, we expected volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian. But the decline was greater than we anticipated due to the more challenging macro trends and was broadly consistent with the performance of these categories. For mustard in the Americas, extremely low price points in private label impacted our consumption and is driving down category dollars. We plan to improve our volume trends in 2024 by narrowing price gaps, increasing promotions and, importantly, through distribution wins. Recipe mixes in the Americas showed increased stress from crossing key price points due to previous pricing actions. We have a plan to address these to return to volume growth. In our flavors product category, some of our consumer packaged food group customers experienced greater softness in volumes within their own business, more than we expected in both the Americas and EMEA. Finally, our growth of quick service restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Within Asia Pacific, some of our customers are experiencing boycotts in Southeast Asia related to geopolitical events. We are monitoring the situation and anticipate continued softness in these customer's volume to continue into 2024. Turning to what met our expectations in the quarter; we drove volume growth for a second quarter in a row in America spices and seasonings. In branded food service, our growth was strong across the portfolio driven by volume. In Asia Consumer, our recovery from COVID-related disruptions in China was in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. Outside of China, for the quarter, our volume growth was strong across all categories. In EMEA Consumer, consistent with the third quarter, pricing actions contributed to double digit growth, which pressured volumes. Now I'd like to further build on some of the initiatives within our growth levers, notably increased brand marketing, targeted price gap management, new products and packaging renovation, which have already proven to strengthen our volume trends in key areas. We have intentionally chosen our investments in these areas as we believe they will generate the most significant returns. We are confident our investments will continue to drive improved results in 2024, and we expect to invest more, positioning us further for success in 2025 and going forward. First, America's spices and seasonings is a priority investment area for us, given our category leadership and its profitable growth potential for both McCormick and our customers. Our initiatives are driving U.S. branded sales volume growth, which strength during the fourth quarter in holiday performance. And looking at consumption, we continue to sequentially improve share trends again in the fourth quarter both in terms of dollars and units. We continue to activate initiatives of price gap management, innovation, packaging and a meaningful step-up in brand marketing support for America's spices and seasonings. And the results have begun to materialize, demonstrating that we have the right plans and are taking the right actions to grow in this attractive category. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday herb and spice portfolio, which began in the second quarter of 2023, continues to roll out according to plan. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had shifted about 75% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have fully transitioned on shelf experienced stronger velocity. We are pleased with our results to date, which increased our confidence that this renovation will be a strong contribution to our growth in 2024 as our customers' shelves continue to transition. We are making progress on restoring distribution that was lost due to past supply issues. We have secured wins and new distribution. We expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results mid-2024, coinciding with most of our customers' shelf resets. Overall, we have a robust set of initiatives in flight and anticipate making progress throughout the year. I would expect growth in share gains in units and volume to lead our trends. Spending a moment on spices and seasonings and other key markets. Similar initiatives as in the U.S. are driving volume growth and share gains in Canada, France and Australia. We also renovated our spice and herb portfolio in Southeast Asia, with the same innovative packaging as the U.S. and EMEA, and began shipping the new products in the fourth quarter. We are supporting this transition with increased marketing spend in the first quarter. Next, in branded foodservice, we achieved strong volume growth across all customer segments. Our foodservice operators continue to expand their value menu options, and they are turning to our products to deliver great taste for a fraction of their costs. We drove share gains in spices and seasonings as well as our hot sauce share of tabletop, with expanded distribution, new products, customer wins and increased menu penetration, as well as our expertise in heat. Heat continues to be a growth accelerator globally for total McCormick, outpacing the rest of the portfolio as customers and consumers alike continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. New products contributed to fourth quarter growth. For instance, in the U.S., our Cholula salsas in the Mexican aisle are building distribution and bringing new consumers to the category. And our branded food service items, Frank's Mild Wings Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot continue to perform at. In the U.K., Australia, we are driving hot sauce category growth with Cholula gaining momentum on shelf. In the U.S., we secured new hot sauce distribution during the quarter. And in the first quarter, we are launching new Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format, as well as our national launch of Frank's Dill Pickle. We are well positioned going into our Super Bowl merchandising period. In summary, our investments in the key areas I just highlighted favorably impacted both our volume and margin performance for the quarter. Moving to gross margin. We are pleased with our performance, which continued to improve as the year progressed. Our results reflect effective price realization, the optimization of our cost structure and favorable product mix, driven by our portfolio optimization and focus in key areas. While confident in our ability to return to our historical margin profile in the near term, we will use improvements in our profitability to fuel continued investments in our business to drive our top line. We are in a strong position to benefit from the virtuous flywheel of margin expansion given the work that's been done throughout the business, and we are able to intentionally focus our investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. Reflecting on our full year 2023 performance, I am proud of the progress we made in advancing our business in the right direction and our team is focused on returning to our long-term growth algorithm, strengthening our margins, significantly improving our cash flow, paying down our debt and reducing our leverage ratio. All have put McCormick in a position of strength to further invest with a focus on growth. Our foundation is strong. We have proven and powerful brands, and the results we are seeing from our refined and strengthened plans provide confidence in the effectiveness of our strategies and investments. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we expect volume trends to improve throughout the year and volume growth during the second half, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. The pace of margin recovery to historical levels will take time as our focus is on investing to drive sustainable sales growth to generate quality earnings for years to come. I also want to highlight on share performance, that we are approaching our plans differently with an even greater competitive posture and more intentionality towards driving growth in our key categories. Now, let me highlight some ways in which we will drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Starting in our Consumer segment with category management, where a key capability is revenue management, we have been building our discipline in revenue management for several years and have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. As you would expect, this has become even more important in recent years. In the current environment, we are taking a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors, accelerating our efforts across various products and are seeing results. In our spices and seasonings category, we selected individual items we believe would be the most responsive based on the elasticities we were experiencing. For instance, in our iconic Black Pepper and Vanilla product lines, our actions proved to be effective. We are recapturing buyers, increasing household penetration and are driving profitable volume growth that is outpacing the category volume growth in these product lines. As I mentioned earlier, across key price points in Americas recipe mixes and are also leaning into our revenue management execution in this category. For example, in the fourth quarter, we focused on gravy as a key holiday item, which drove results, contributing to our successful holiday season. We expect to see further results from our actions as we work through the portfolio. Across all markets, our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. These investments we make in price gap management result in greater volumes and improved margins over time. Importantly, customers that are adopting our recommendations are seeing better category performance, and McCormick is driving volume and share growth in their respective businesses. We are prioritizing brand marketing connecting with consumers and fueling growth with our increased investments. We have a history of investing behind our brands and did so again in 2023. We plan for a strong start to 2024, with aggressive first quarter brand marketing investments which are well underway. We expect a significant increase for the year, concentrated to the first half. We will continue to invest across various channels. We plan to further drive household penetration and increase buy rates with additional focus in retail media. Our first quarter plans include an increased Christmas holiday campaigns in all regions, increasing our value-focused messaging for our everyday spices and seasonings and recipe mix in the U.S. Also, supporting our packaging renovations that I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Southeast Asia, and promoting our new products in EMEA. Turning to new products, which are a key growth driver in both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. In the Consumer segment, our 2023 launches are expected to substantially contribute to growth in 2024. For instance, in EMEA, we are thrilled with the early results from our range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes that we launched with Nadiya Hussain, a British celebrity chef, as we entered the fourth quarter. We are expanding our household penetration, bringing in new and younger households into the brand. The recipe mixes in this range contributed along with other new products and expanded distribution to our fourth quarter growth in U.K. recipe mixes, which was double the category rate. In Flavor Solutions, collaborating with our customers on innovation continues to be a key driver of success. Across the portfolio, our customers continue to focus on innovation to meet consumers' needs. We are winning in flavors with better-for-you products and on-trend flavors; and, in branded foodservice, with our heat platform and value-oriented products for foodservice operators. We are pleased with our 2023 performance from new products, which contributed to our sales growth and accelerate compared to the prior year, as we expected. Importantly, we have a strong lineup of new products spanning heat, freshness, value, convenience and flavor exploration in our Consumer segment for 2024, which we will share more about at CAGNY in February. And in Flavor Solutions, we are also carrying a robust pipeline of new products into 2024, positioning McCormick and our customers for success. We are leveraging our proprietary technologies and Flavor Solutions to support our innovation to win share in attractive high-growth categories and to attract new customers. In addition, with our differentiated customer engagement approach, we are intentionally targeting a mid-market customer base who are category leaders in high-growth innovators as well as diversifying our customer base to drive share gains across our portfolio and profitable growth. Our actions are yielding results. For instance, in the fourth quarter, our volume growth in performance nutrition significantly outpaced the market. And in the beverage category, we drove sales growth even though the category decelerated, partially by targeting high-value and high-growth segments within beverage. With our flavor leadership and continued investments, we are fully committed to vigorously fuel category growth with our differentiated portfolio. We have confidence in our plans, which we'll build throughout the year and yield volume growth during the back half of the year. We are dedicating more resources to categories where we have the right to continue to win. We are seeing our actions drive momentum and solid results in areas where we have focused. We believe that the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, our categories and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now before I turn it over to Mike to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance and 2024 outlook, I would like to comment on recent changes in our Board of Directors. Freeman Hrabowski who has served as a Director for 27 years, will be retiring from the Board as of the end of March. I am grateful for his service and contributions, which has significantly benefited McCormick, and we will miss him. I also want to welcome Terry Thomas, who has joined our Board. Terry brings extensive global consumer product industry expertise through his current role as Chief Growth Officer for Flowers Foods, and his experience at Unilever prior to that. I look forward to working with Terry and the contributions he will make to McCormick.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting 5% of pricing benefit, offset by a 3% volume mix decline. As Brendan mentioned, our volume performance was impacted by changes in consumers' behavior. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales were flat, reflecting a 4% increase from pricing actions, offset by a 4% volume decline. The benefit from our recovery in China and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins netted to no overall impact for the total Consumer segment. On Slide 11, consumer sales in the Americas decreased 4% in constant currency with the DSD exit I just mentioned driving 2% of that decline. The remaining sales decline was due to lower volume and product mix in several areas of the portfolio, including, as Brendan mentioned, prepared foods, mustard and recipe mixes, which was partially offset by volume growth in spices and seasonings, which was driven by our investments. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Sales growth was broad-based across markets and categories. We remain at an elevated pricing environment in EMEA, and we expect volumes to improve as pricing wins in 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region increased 31%, driven by a 26% volume increase, primarily due to the expected recovery in China. Outside of China, we also drove double-digit sales growth with strong volume and broad-based growth across all categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 14. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 5%, reflecting a 7% increase from pricing, offset by a 2% decrease from volume and product mix. Our growth momentum in this segment was exceptional through the third quarter. And even with a deceleration in the fourth quarter, our sales growth for the year was strong. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales rose 6%, driven by pricing, as volume and product mix was comparable to the prior year. Sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio and led by branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 2%, and with pricing actions contributing 14%, partially offset by a 3% impact from the divestiture of the Giotti canning business, a 9% decline in all other volume due to softness in some of our customers' volumes within their own businesses and a 1% impact from exiting a private label product line. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with a 6% contribution from pricing, offset by a 1% volume decline. Our business in China delivered strong growth. Outside of China, sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts in some of our quick service restaurant customers, as Brendan mentioned. As seen on Slide 18, gross profit margin expanded 320 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix in both segments and our CCI and GOE programs, as well as effective price realization. Additionally, we lapped elevated costs related to some discrete issues and flavor solutions operations. Overall, we ended 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and the year. Now moving to Slide 19. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A, increased relative to the fourth quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect to invest further in 2024 to support our brands. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 190 basis points. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment was flat. And in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased $0.73 in constant currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in the fourth quarter, as expected, we drove significant margin expansion versus prior year in this segment. For the total company, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points in the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the year, which reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make investments early in 2024 to fuel top-line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 20. Our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact this year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the fourth quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business contributed meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 22, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85 as compared to $0.73 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by gross margin expansion and the results from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture I just mentioned. On Slide 23, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in 2023, $1.2 billion, nearly double our cash flow of $652 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $419 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $264 million for capital expenditures in 2023. Our capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. We expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. We are well-positioned to continue paying down debt and coupled with ending 2023 and with a leverage ratio slightly above our 2024 year-end target of 3 times. We are pleased to be deleveraging faster than expected. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 24. Our 2024 outlook reflects our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. We are well positioned with our cost savings programs to fuel investments for volume growth as well as generate operating margin expansion. The balancing of margin expansion and investments to drive growth is critical to our success, not only in 2024, but also into 2025 and beyond as we remain committed and confident in our long-term algorithm. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. On the top line, we expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth.  We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year. First, we expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we are expecting to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. We have made strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth that will also impact volumes during the year. We decided to exit DSD of our bagged Hispanic spices in Americas consumer and to exit a private label product line in EMEA Flavor Solutions, both will impact the first quarter. And we divested the Giotti canning business, which will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business through the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. And finally, in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our China business. Moving to gross margin. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and the cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new flavor solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by our investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year and weighted more to the first quarter. Overall, based on the flow-through of our volume expectations and the timing of our investments, we expect our profit to be less robust in the first half and anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring discrete items. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick De Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023, or 5% to 7% in constant currency. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments on Slide 25. Our business is moving in the right direction, we strengthened our margins, significantly improved our cash flow and are deleveraging ahead of expectations. From a top line perspective, volume trends improved sequentially through the third quarter, but fourth quarter performance was disappointing. Parts of our portfolio grew underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working. In areas that were challenged, we know the drivers and are addressing those that we control. And combined with the initiatives we have in place, we fully expect we will drive improved trends and build to volume growth during the second half of 2024. We are committed to recovering our margins in both segments to historical levels, while making investments to drive sustainable top line growth. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place. And we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in 2024 and beyond. I am excited for the year ahead, which will be my first full year as CEO. I plan to drive an ambitious agenda with greater competitive posture and more intentionality that capitalize on our strong business fundamentals as well as the value of our brands and capabilities and have driven our past success. McCormick is a growth company, a global leader in flavor, with a long-term orientation and a strong culture. I am committed to advance our leadership and our differentiation. Our strategic pillars: growth, performance and people, remain consistent. I am energized to further incorporate my mark on our growth plans. In a fast-changing global environment, we need to build on our competitive strengths and opportunities to remain a differentiated market leader. As such, I would like to share the five priorities that the entire McCormick organization is rallying behind, as we enter 2024. First, strengthen our global leadership in core categories. That means, growing volume and market share in herbs, spices and seasonings and condiments, strengthening our leadership in heat and increasing the global scale of our flavors business and expanding our branded foodservice business. Second, drive profitable growth and higher returns on investments. We want to restore the operating margin we have lost the last several years. But importantly, do so in a measured way, using our cost savings and operating leverage to fuel top line growth in the near-term that will drive sustainable profits for years to come. Third, accelerate our digital transformation to enhance how we serve consumers and customers to work faster and more efficiently, and to strengthen decision-making by further leveraging data and insights. Fourth, continue to elevate our power of people culture and build the next generation of leaders and capabilities that will drive McCormick's success well into future years. And finally, all these contribute to our fifth priority, which is to strengthen and expand stem competitive advantages to make McCormick even more effective in the marketplace. Our advantages are critical to ensuring we deliver on our growth potential. Simply put, I am committed to harnessing the collective expertise of our talented McCormick team with a renewed sense of urgency and speed to deliver on these priorities, resulting in long-term sustainable profitable growth that will be industry-leading. While 2024 is an important year of investments, we are confident in our capabilities and enthusiastic about some early signposts of success. And we are committed to returning to the type of growth that investors expect from McCormick. The foundation has been laid and building blocks are in place, and I look forward to sharing more about them at CAGNY in February. As I said, I am excited for the year ahead and delivering on our long-term objectives. Finally, before turning to your questions, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2023, and the momentum they are carrying into 2024, and reiterate my confidence that, together, we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Maybe to start off, given where you ended 2023 and coupled with your commentary on investing in the business, I guess, can you tell us a bit about how you're thinking about volume as you progress through 2024, and I guess how you would be positioned going into 2025? \nBrendan Foley: Well, Andrew, thanks for the question. Let me start by commenting on how we ended 2023 from a volume perspective. While the fourth quarter was below our expectations, there were bright spots, because our actions are working in a number of categories that are critical for us. And for the challenging area, you know what the issues are, and I'm pleased with the speed and urgency with which the team is addressing them.  I guess just to step back, pre-pandemic, we consistently drove volume growth across our business in both segments. And the macro dynamics of the last several years disrupted this. And so we see 2024 as an important moment to get back there as soon as we can. We do have a bias towards even greater investment on the business. And as I've said, we're approaching our plans differently with even greater competitive posture, greater intentionality towards driving volume growth and share in those key and really attractive categories. I think where we stand at this point in 2024 is we appear to be moving beyond those macro dynamics. Yet at the same time, we recognize the uncertainty of the environment, and therefore, I'm taking a cautious view on that outlook. From a consumption standpoint, we do expect to exit 2024 in a stronger position than how we exited in 2023. And importantly, though, we're also entering 2024 in a position of strength in terms of our ability to invest in the business and expand margins. So we're able to intentionally focus those investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. We expect our volumes to improve as we progress through the year and to drive the volume growth during the second half. This momentum is expected to continue into 2025, notwithstanding any new surprises on sort of the macroeconomic headwinds that might be out there. And I believe our investments will drive quality earnings growth and will put us on a trajectory of -- on that long-term algorithm. So those are the -- that's the way we're thinking about exiting '23, how we're thinking about '24 and as we go into '25.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks. And then I guess a good segue to that is, how is that you're able to make investments to drive the top line and yet still improve margins. I was hoping you could help us a bit with that perspective. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, as I said, we're entering '24 in a position of strength after navigating these dynamics over the last several years. And I'll turn it over to Mike just to give some context, and I'll wrap it up with a few other thoughts.\nMike Smith: Yes. Good morning, Andrew. Yes, as you saw from our results, we ended the year with strong operating margin performance, and for the full year, up 100 basis points. A big key to our recovery was recovering the cost increases through pricing. Obviously, 20% cost increases two years ago, over 10% last year, there was a big job to do that. So we're able to do that in 2023, which helped our margins. Our CCI and GOE programs, we've talked about a lot, really performed and give a strong momentum, frankly, into 2024. 2024, as you think about this year, we're showing some margin improvement about 80 basis points. And with low single-digit inflation, and you think about four or five years ago when we had low single-digit inflation, CCI really works for us. You take a little bit of pricing and we're having some pricing wrap in 2024 and then you can decide what to do with. And CCI, some of it drops to the bottom line through margin improvement, we're making those increased revenue price cap investments, which we've always done some degree of that, but also our brand A&P up -- double digits is another way we're using CCI this year. So it's kind of a sweet spot for us at low single-digit inflation environment as we think about it. And the portfolio optimization we've talked about last year, which -- a bit of that continues into this year. So, again, helping drive our margins up. We want to recover over time the gross profit margins we had pre-pandemic, but we're doing it judiciously.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nBrendan Foley: Mike said on sort of this portfolio optimization, we really do see that working. So we did make a couple of intentional moves as you know. That's really, I think, allowing us to invest even more in the part of the portfolio, which we know will be the strongest. And then we did make a lot of targeted investments in '23. So that's yielding results. We like where that's going. And it's achieving high ROI, and that's carrying us into '24. So I do believe this intentional investment in those categories that are core to us will really be the biggest drivers of profitable growth. And we should see that margin accretion from that mix of sales. So we really do believe we're operating in a position of strength there.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nKen Goldman: Hi. I wanted to ask about Consumer Americas. In particular, you spoke today about managing price gaps, maybe a bit more tightly ahead. We started to hear from some other food producers that in the U.S., maybe some promotional lifts aren't working quite as well as expected. I guess I was just curious if this is a dynamic you've experienced as well. And I really am trying to get a sense just how much more investment is needed to narrow the price gaps you mentioned. And if in general, really consumer behavior in the U.S. is, in some way, more difficult to navigate than what it's been in past challenging times or kind of pretty much what you expect to see as consumers tighten their wallets a little bit.\nMike Smith: Okay. Let me kick off and -- a couple of questions in there. The first, I think, had to do with just promotional lifts and what we're seeing. And I'm not necessarily trying to compare to the comments of other companies. But what we're seeing right now in our business today is we're not seeing huge declines or sort of reduced significant lifts of promotion. But there's an important consideration there, which is we're really a heavy base business. We don't have a ton of, if you think about our percentage of consumption. We're in the 90% range in terms of base consumption and the rest is really coming through promotions. So we're not overly reliant there. And I would just say that it's probably an area that I don't know that it's fair to draw a correlation between our performance and others. Now price gap management, in terms of how we're approaching that, we're looking across our portfolio. And just in the case of like spices and seasonings, it's a really broad portfolio with many subcategories underneath there. And each and every item -- you take compare black pepper to Montreal Steak they all have different price elasticities and where the consumer is to go. And so we have been surgically looking at this at a SKU level to make sure that we're doing the right thing to really drive overall growth in volume and unit consumption. And so that's allowed us to really, I think, be very, very sharp about how we drive this investment in a targeted way to make sure that we're starting to drive volume growth. In 2023, we saw a lot of improvement in parts of our business where we started to apply this. And I think like I said on the call, a good example was Black Pepper or Vanilla, and we started to really see the -- not only the volume of the unit share gain. And so that gave us really, I think, a lot of kind of stair-step into those investments. And that's the way we're going to do it in 2024 too. We're expanding that investment. We're going to continue to look at the line, we assess it. Honestly, every month and taking a look at where we see the individual products perform across the shelf. And then we decide what we need to do from a revenue and category standpoint. But I wanted to put on top of that, we're applying more A&P to the business, too, at the same time. And I think that's really important. We are seeing really good performance from A&P and it encourages us to continue to spend more on the business. And so you'll see more of that from us, I think, going forward. I'm not sure if I captured all your questions there, but let me know if I did.\nBrendan Foley: I think to maybe one point. As we get the price differentials right, the advertising is even more effective. And that's important. And we're happy with the ROIs on our A&P, but it gets even better when you have the right price differential, as we've seen with Black Pepper, Vanilla and other categories.\nKen Goldman: No that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just a very quick follow-up, I wasn't quite sure I picked up on what you think the most important tactics may need to be to get momentum rolling in your China Consumer business to the extent you want. And maybe how quickly some of those actions can start to take effect.\nBrendan Foley: On China, and just a little bit of context here, our food away from home business, which is included in Asia Pacific Consumer, it definitely will \u2013 we expect to see slower demand, especially sort of in the first half of the year. But we do expect overall China sales in 2024 to be comparable to 2023. But maybe for some more additional context, Mike and I spent a week in China in early January, just actually a few weeks ago just visiting our teams there and assessing dense conditions. And I would say, broadly, our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious. There's a number of indicators that kind of point to this. There's high unemployment with young adults, low consumer confidence. We see consumers with a reluctance to spend. And uniquely in our business, we tend to serve the smaller independent restaurants, particularly in Central China, and we see them losing traffic to larger chains and QSRs, because they're really driving either really strong value or they're winning on just even more store growth overall. And so we see this playing out in the retail category there, especially with the modern trade. Just to share a quick anecdote, as we were there, I took one afternoon just to walk around and actually I forgot the pack a tie, So I had to go buy a tie and go to an apartment store. What struck me was really a lot of movement in people outside than on the streets. And I want to go get a cup of coffee. It's kind of empty. Go to the department store, not spoke with anybody almost. And so there's just not really a lot of active spending. We see a lot of people out and about the mobilities there, and it's returned, but we're not seeing the spending. And I think it's broadly sort of an example of what we are observing as we were in the market there. Having said that though, like we do in other regions, we do have plans to really address the change in trends with the Chinese consumer. And we do expect our Flavor Solutions business to be a bit stronger this year just due to the QSR trends. But we do expect a gradual recovery in China, starting probably more in the second half of 2024. And the exact pace of growth will really be determined by how that macroeconomic parameter kind of plays out and consumer confidence plans over the next few quarters. But we really do continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of this market and are working to strengthen those plans as we go through 2024.\nKen Goldman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone. \nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. So your sales algorithm for 2024 is obviously below where it would normally be at minus 1% to plus 1%. Can you quantify how much of a headwind are these deliberate decisions to exit the DSD business, to divest canning, to exit low-margin business in Europe? We just want to get a sense for how much is you choosing to exit versus what the underlying numbers are?\nMike Smith: Hi, Alexia, yes, it's around 1% for Q1, but then it really Peters out the rest of the year. So very small the rest of the year. But 1% for Q1 as we lapped the decisions we made last year.\nAlexia Howard: Got it. Okay. And then the market share trends in U.S. measured channels are obviously what everybody seems to have their eye on right now. Do you have a view, given your price gap management and the marketing spending investments, the innovation pickup, when we might start to see that improve sequentially and when we might even start to see that turn positive again? Just wondering how long it's going to take to start to see those benefits in the share line.\nBrendan Foley: Well, Alexia, thanks for the question. We never really project exactly what to expect and share, because there's just a lot of dynamics that might happen at the shelf. But I would point to how we're talking about volume and our outlook on volume as we think about the first half, the second half and as we expect to kind of grow volume in the back half of the year. That certainly will have an influence on what we see play out in share performance. But we tend not to sort of specifically tell you. I don't think that there is a specific quarter I can tell you when that's going to happen.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hi, thanks for the question. With regard to cadence on the top line, it sounds like you've got volume trends that could improve as you go through the year with even growth in the second half. But then you've got the impact of last year's pricing actions which will wane as we go through the year. Would you expect those two factors to roughly offset each other, such that organic net sales growth is relatively consistent through the year? Or is there any net sales cadence we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.\nMike Smith: I mean the pricing, Max, is really focused on the first half a bit more in the first quarter based on the timing of our pricing. I mean, the volume growth is sequential across both segments. And as you know, based on our fourth quarter performance, Flavor Solutions is exiting the year a little better trajectory than -- or at least based than Consumer. So as you model those things, you think about sequential improvement to get to that zero to negative two volume growth kind of the first half, second half story. And then pricing is really heavily weighted to the first half, primarily the first quarter.\nMax Gumport: Thanks. And then as a follow-up, you've characterized your outlook as embedding a more cautious view regarding 2024, a few times now. It sounds like much of that conservatism is around your underlying assumptions on volume. You talked about the value-seeking behavior in the U.S. and flat sales growth in China. But I was hoping you could dive a bit deeper into some of those more cautious use you're taking and also they're impacting your gross margin commentary as well? Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, good morning, Max, I'll maybe kick it off with some context around your question on sales and consumption and sort of the state of the consumer, and I'll pass it over to Mike for commentary on -- I think you had a question there with regard to margin. But I think we are taking a cautious view with regard to where the consumer is right now. And that's really informed by what we saw in Q4. We just saw a little bit more shifting, particularly as you think about how the quarter played out and if you think about consumption trends, we saw consumers really pulled back in September and October, and then really wait until right before the holidays to really make a lot of their purchases. And we even see -- saw similar indications leading up to Christmas. So, what's underneath that, I think, is people were certainly holding off there, making a lot more trips to the store, buying a lot fewer items and units. And maybe even smaller units actually started to come true, I think, from a consumer trend standpoint. And I think we just have to acknowledge that this is a little bit different than what we saw in the summer. It was a little bit more pronounced. Certainly, it affected our trends as we kind of been really clear about. And so it's prudent for us to just take a cautious view where the consumer is going to be going here in early 2024. And so we felt like it was best to recognize that in our outlook, particularly as we think about the first half of the year. But we're also going to be putting in more investment in the business, more A&P. So we expect also to be able to meet the consumer where they are right now and really try to focus on our game plan, which is to drive volume growth. Mike, do you want to add...\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Would you mind repeating the margin question, I didn't quite get that.\nMax Gumport: I was wondering if the conservatism that you discussed that really is just focused on the commentary you just discussed on volumes or if it applies to gross margins as well, that there's some -- more cautious outlook embedded in the gross margin guidance as well?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. I mean we're confident in our CCI and GOE programs. I mean we've baked -- low single-digit inflation environment, like I said before, which we have good line of sight generally for the rest of the year, gives us more confidence there. First quarter is going to be our highest cost increase. And we see it petering down after that and our pricing is going to be the highest in the first quarter, too. Generally, I think what I'd say, if you think about last year with our GOE programs, we met our targets. Actually, we exceeded a bit our external targets. We were a bit prudent because -- but we met our internal target. So I would say being prudent is the word of the day. And love to over-deliver if we could. But we also realized in this environment, making investments on price gap management and A&P is really important. So we'll assess that as the year goes on.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Hi. Thanks very much. \nBrendan Foley: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Powers: So -- good morning. So it sounds like at the enterprise level, pretty minimal pricing in the back half. I think that implies, as I listened to the commentary and kind of do the math and think about the price gap management, I think that implies negative pricing in the Consumer business at least in the U.S. in the back half. I wonder if you can talk about that, how deep those kind of above-the-line investments may need to be or how you're thinking about that. And whether there's a risk that at the enterprise level pricing actually, this negative, as we flow through the year in pursuit of this volume recovery.\nMike Smith: Yes, Steve, it's Mike. I'll take that. And if Brendan has any comments, he'll layer then in. I mean we talk about pricing for the full year being around 1%, and that includes our price gap management, too. So don't miss that point. And as you think about the first quarter, as I said before, that's the majority of the lapping of last year's pricing. First quarter, first half, that's where a lot of the price activities come through, so less so in the second six. So I'd say that for the full year, we're comfortable with pricing at one, I don't know what math you're looking at to make it negative, but I don't see that, honestly, for the full year. And from a -- and really by segment, too, you've got to think about it too. I mean Flavor Solutions is going to be a bit higher than 1%. Consumer is going to be a little bit lower from a pricing perspective. So we're managing it very closely. And we're comfortable with the full year guidance.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. I guess in Flavor Solutions, can you help just maybe a little bit more perspective on what you're assuming both in terms of Flavor's customer volume trends and restaurant traffic, both in the U.S. and overseas, where you've seen some softness to late? Just want to a little perspective there on that segment.\nBrendan Foley: Sure, Steve. Our growth momentum in Flavor Solutions was pretty exceptional, I think, throughout the year in 2023 with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and slight volume growth there. But even with the deceleration in the fourth quarter, we had pretty strong organic growth throughout 2023. And we do expect to continue to make really good progress there. Although, we\u2019re not going to be in double digits, I think, in 2024, but still making really good progress. To give you maybe more of a regional consideration, as I think through the portfolio. In the Americas, we continue to drive strong branded foodservice volume. And in flavors, particularly in a number of the categories that we tend to have some strong performance and like performance nutrition and beverage, we see continued strong performance in volume. And I think that we would expect that to continue into 2024. Across the rest of the flavor product category, a lot of our growth was impacted by the softness of our customers' performance in the market with regard to units and volume. And we saw a little bit more drop than we would have expected, not inconsistent with our own consumer business. And so while we're disappointed in that softness, we still believe our results are pretty good in this area. I think that's the chance of that continuing to 2024, probably likely. In EMEA, as we mentioned in our third quarter call, that our customers there are, both for packaged goods and also quick serve restaurants, are experiencing softness in their volumes within their business, too. And we anticipated that in the fourth quarter. However, there's even maybe a little bit more than what we expected. So almost like a similar theme to what I said about the U.S. And so we expect some softness related there as we enter in Q1. But we're optimistic, again, that we'll continue to sort of improve every quarter as we go through 2024. And then in Asia Pacific, our growth that was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic. Some of that really had to do with just unrelated matters, but some boycotts issues that we're seeing in Southeast Asia. But we saw some nice performance in China, so I would expect that to continue in 2024 and some trends. So that's just some context around Flavor Solutions.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Okay. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. I wanted to come back to the consumer segment and maybe at a higher level. As we think about where the business and the specific categories are today versus where they were pre-COVID. Obviously, there's enough number of consumption and occasion changes in terms -- and distribution changes with inflation through the pandemic. But where are we today in your business and your key categories, as you think about price elasticity, as you think about price gaps and where there actually has been a lasting consumption change versus consumer behavior pre-pandemic.\nBrendan Foley: Well, with so much has changed since 2019, I think that -- if I think about the entirety of all the different levers and variables that you were talking about, whether it's price elasticity or volume and where the consumer is, there's been reasonably enough significant change that. As we take a look at our categories, we're taking a look at in terms of how they're performing today and where we need to go in order to drive volume growth. And as we said earlier, that's a component of increased A&P. A lot of that advertising focused on talking about value. Parts of our portfolio, we know that price gap management can have a really effective impact on turning around unit volume trends. And so I think that's an indication of where the consumer is right now. If you look at unit volume performance, either in our business or probably the category, pricing has had an impact, and we have to acknowledge that. Having said that, though, if I compare our business organically, and product mix, compared to 2019, our total organic volume is about the same as 2019. We haven't really lost significant volume or on product mix since pre-pandemic. And so I think that's one sort of consideration to have is, while there's been a lot of change in many ups and downs, I think, if you think about all these macro dynamic impacts we've been going through, we find ourselves in a similar volume position as we were in 2019. I don't -- I think I might have provided the context that you're looking for.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, as we think about Flavor Solutions moving forward, just how do you think about -- you see the competitive position of the portfolio today, what you're seeing from your customers, the categories you're in and the competitive set, do you feel like you have the breadth of portfolio? Do you think that the categories that are growing with your customers or you're properly positioned to participate there? Or do you think that, as you look at kind of the -- your peers, that there's room to narrow the growth gap?\nBrendan Foley: Well, as I think about our competitive posture in Flavor Solutions, I feel really good about it. It starts with having great capabilities in technology and a great team. And I think we do have a differentiated approach towards driving growth, particularly in flavors and seasonings in that part of our business. From a technology standpoint, we continue to win and sort of there's -- a lot of categories that we operate in there that we're targeting because they're positive and high growth. And we also tend to get a good mix of large customers and moderately in small-sized customers who tend to be characterized by much even higher growth. As we think about that as a portfolio mix of customers, we're seeing a lot of strength coming from that. And I would just point to our Boeing trends throughout '23. And as we think about '24 to be an indication of how we think we're performing relative to the market there overall. And so those are some indications. Now, the other one on top of that would be heat. And we continue to see growth through heat. We continue to see that as a as the part of that portfolio, if you will, it tends to grow at an even higher rate just due to where consumers are. And we talked a lot about heat extensively in terms of how popular it is. And so that's another reason to believe that we feel like we're competitively poised in this part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's one that's receiving a lot of increased investment, too, as we think about building capacity, technology and really growing to global scale.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate the color all. I will pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt Smith: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little bit on the guidance. If we look at it from a high level, it includes roughly 80 basis points or so of operating margin expansion. Can you talk about the expansions for each business as we look at fiscal 2024? Is Flavor Solutions expected to have an outsized contribution again as margin continues to recover there? And can the margin expand in the Consumer business, even as you step up investments to manage price gaps and absolute price points?\nMike Smith: Hi Matt, its Mike. I mean they're not materially different between segments to be honest. So the 50 to 100 basis points at the gross margin line and approximately 80 at the OP margin line. To your point, there are some price gap management items within the Consumer business, but there's also portfolio optimization, the GOE and CCI numbers which hit both segments. So I would say not materially different.\nMatt Smith: Thank you for that. And a follow-up on the price gaps and absolute price points that you're talking about managing. One thing we're seeing in the U.S. measured channel data is that the share losses McCormick is seeing in spices and seasonings, only about 1/4 of that is going to private label. Can you talk about the branded environment? Are you seeing a pickup in competitive pressure there? Or is this really a product of price gaps that you believe you can manage to?\nBrendan Foley: Largely, I think it's a product of price gaps that we can manage to. But I think your observations would align with ours in that it isn't strictly an issue regarding private label or other branded competition. I think it's really an attractive category that has always received new competitors and new entrants. And so we look broadly when we think about competition in that part of our portfolio, as being -- and at the shelf is both watching those gaps versus private label and also branded competitors.\nMatt Smith: Thank you. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Just a couple of follow-up questions hi there Brendan and Mike.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning Rob. Hello.\nRobert Moskow: Yes. In the past, you used to give a global flavor category growth rate, and I remember it being around 4% to 6%. Do you still keep track of that globally? And do you know where it is right now? And just -- and then I have a follow-up.\nBrendan Foley: We do. I mean we look at that annually. And it's part of our strategic planning process. And so yes, we do spend time making sure we understand how that's performing. But I think your 5% to 7%, I think, is -- or actually you said 4% to 6%, but I would tell you it's generally around those same numbers. We tend to think about it is 5% to 7% at a global level.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So the global demand for flavor really hasn't changed. It's just that -- but your top line guide is around zero. So is the message here today that nothing's really changed in the consumer demand for flavor? Because it sounds like you're also saying there's a lot of trading down going on or cautious consumer spending, so I thought that would mean that the category is a little bit weaker, too.\nBrendan Foley: No, I would urge you not to take away that as an indication that the category is weaker. This is still a very attractive category. Also appreciate that the category at the global level has also gone through a lot of inflation in pricing and similar factors, but we still see this as a very attractive category for the total company. And so that is not the view that we take, particularly with the data that we look at. And so I think maybe that got at the heart of your question.\nRobert Moskow: Yes, certainly. And then the follow-up is, you said that you shipped 75% of your new packaging to retailers so far. But do you have any way of quantifying what percent of the ACV has implemented your resets? I thought some of it would happen in 2023. It sounds like a lot will happen in mid-2024. But are you quantifying that way?\nBrendan Foley: It's harder to quantify because it's \u2013 we know how much we're shipping out in terms of our total portfolio that's getting this new package. And so as I said, that number is at 75%. And that, we feel that's \u2013 we're pretty accurate about that. But now the reflection on shelf, as all this inventory is flowing in on shelf, that's happening on a lag to that 75% number. We expect it to just continue to increase through the first half of the year. I think through the first half of the year, we should largely be caught up to that number to specific standpoint, too. If you walk into a store today, you're going to see on the shelf some in the old package, some of the new package, and that's just maybe an indication of how you might think about flow-through overall. However, I will tell you that as we do look at specific accounts and locations where we know we're seeing a lot of that flow through already have occurred, we are seeing a nice pickup in velocity as we would have expected to be the case, because we've seen this package perform in EMEA in a similar way. And it really does deliver on the SKUs for freshness for consumers and really kind of takes it up a notch in terms of the overall benefit and offering that we're providing consumers. So we feel pretty good about that. What you'll also hear us talk about is we're going to start to move other parts of the product line into this package, too, beginning in the back half of 2024. So we're not done. But this part of our line that we've been speaking about since mid-last year is still in the process of flowing through on shelf.\nMike Smith: That gives us belief in the sequential building of volume during 2024 into the second half, as you alluded to.\nRobert Moskow: Right. I'm sorry, one last question. I appreciate the plan to increase brand building this year. Can you tell us how much it increased in 2023 when it was all said and done?\nBrendan Foley: I think we were, Rob, if I'm not mistaken\u2026\nMike Smith: 3% to 4% range, yes.\nBrendan Foley: 3% to 4% range for 2023. Know that underneath that, we tend to see working media grow a lot faster than that, because we're also offsetting it with other productivity and taking out more nonworking investments. But 2023 is in that range. Now 2024 though, is in the double-digit range. And we feel really good about that where we're putting that investment.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe if we could just touch quickly on kind of Q1, because I think kind of throughout the call, I've heard you say maybe slightly higher cost relative to the full year in Q1 and then also feel like A&C is a little front half loaded. And then I think maybe volumes, given -- hopefully, they improved of the year, would imply that there be a little bit more pressure in Q1, especially given the divestment. So, just curious if there are certain moving pieces to Q1 that you would clearly like us to consider. So that's the first question.\nMike Smith: Yes, that's great. Let me take that one, Rob, and maybe summarize it all for you. And as you've pointed out, the sequential improvement in volume we see from the fourth quarter, also considered, Consumer starting at a slightly lower place in flavor solutions. So as you model that, build that into your model and build throughout the year. Pricing actions are primarily first -- the lapping of that primarily first half related. Maybe concentrated, I'd say, in the first quarter. However, cost in the first quarter, we're still seeing high single-digit inflation. It does go down to averaging of low single-digit inflation for the year, but there is a spike -- not a spike, but the highest level will be in the first quarter at high single-digit inflation. We get a bit of favorable product mix in the first quarter due to some of the initiatives we're talking about. But we're also seeing some of the negatives from an investment in price gap initiatives in Q1 primarily. So, as we think about pricing, a bit of that will be offset within the price gap management activities. GOE had a little bit of favorability to the wrap from last year in the first half, a bit in the first quarter too. And then as you mentioned, brand marketing up double digits in the first quarter is something that we're really driving toward. And not to forget tax, sometimes we do with tax. It's 22% for the year, but we see a higher tax rate in the first quarter and getting better as the year goes on. And don't forget, unfavorable FX throughout the whole year of about 1%.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And then quickly, just on Flavor Solutions. Clearly, if we look back a few years ago, we speak to the margin recovery now kind of coming out of the post-pandemic cost inflation environment, really kind of the main driver of kind of your somewhat depressed margin now relative to history, still from Flavor Solutions, maybe a little less so. I mean, clearly, you're not optimize or maximize on consumer, but there is a little bit more pressure on Flavor Solutions. So, I'm just curious, I remember going back 15 years or so, right, and there was a strategy to increase that margin in Flavor Solutions that didn't happen, but then it actually really did happen. And now it's just not happening again. So I'm kind of curious, as you think longer term, right, kind of margin profile of McCormick, kind of given the initiatives you've been discussing even today, on improving that side of the business, what kind of does get you back there, right? I mean it's just volume and mix? Or it just seems like that recovery has maybe been a little bit slower? That's all.\nMike Smith: Hi Rob, it's Mike. I'll start and Brendan can add. You're right. We've been on a journey with Flavor Solutions. I can remember, it wasn't 15 years ago, but we were at a 6% OP margin. And we really, through focused cost initiatives, portfolio management, we're able to get that to over 14% pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And we had aspirations for higher because our peers in the flavor industry are higher than that. And we still do aspire to those higher numbers. Obviously, COVID, the pricing costing relationship, that took over 300 basis points as we priced to cost. We did margin up that took -- that's over a 300 basis point impact on our margins there. So we've said we're going to build that back overtime through initiatives like CCI and things like that. We've had early success. I mean with the pricing initiatives we had last year in 2023, we took our operating margin from 8% in 2022 to 10% and 2023, granted still below where we were, but we see positive movement this year as we think about our total margin. I said both segments will see positive operating margin improvement. And we're in the process -- for Flavor Solutions, it's a pretty large number. As we are transitioning our large U.K. manufacturing facility, 2024 and 2025, you'll see some favorable tailwinds there which will help Flavor Solutions' margin. But to your point, and Brendan talked about, the focus on those great growing categories in the flavor side of the business, those are generally higher margin, they're stickier. That is our strategy that will help us drive our margins going forward.\nBrendan Foley: The only thing I'll add on top of what Mike just said with regard to just that constant focus against improving margin. We're also -- as we continue to shift customers to higher-margin product lines, more insulated technology, et cetera, it allows us to continue to grow margin too. But I think Mike pretty much nailed it there. And that's our outlook on it. It's still pretty positive. And it's just going to take us a little bit longer, as we've been calling out really ever since, I think, last year.\nRob Dickerson: Super. Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Freiha, for any final comments.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. And this concludes this morning's conference call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by sharing what we will cover in the morning's call. I will begin with an overview of our fourth quarter year-over-year results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will briefly reflect on our full year 2023 performance and share our plans and building blocks to improve volume in 2024. Mike will then go into more depth on the fourth quarter financial results and the details of our 2024 financial outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will share some closing comments, including our key priorities as I begin my first full year as CEO. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. I want to start by acknowledging that our top-line results for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations, as volume trends decelerated relative to the third quarter. There was greater-than-expected pressure on the consumer that drove changes in their behavior, which impacted our growth. We did, however, see sequential improvement in several key areas within our portfolio, underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working, as I will highlight in a moment. That said, we do recognize that consumers are exhibiting even more value-seeking behavior, they are increasing shopping trips, reducing basket size and making just-in-time purchases, creating further uncertainty in the consumer environment. I want to be clear that we are dedicated to improving volumes. We have refined our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results, and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, and you should expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Now let's go to our fourth quarter performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 5. In our fourth quarter, sales increased 3%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2%, reflecting a 5% contribution from pricing, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in volume and product mix. As expected, the benefit from the China recovery was fully offset by the impact of our strategic decisions to exit DSD -- Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas, and the exit of a private label product line and the divestiture of a small canning business, which was part of our Giotti Flavor Solutions operations in EMEA.  Starting with where results differed from expectations. In Americas Consumer, we expected volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian. But the decline was greater than we anticipated due to the more challenging macro trends and was broadly consistent with the performance of these categories. For mustard in the Americas, extremely low price points in private label impacted our consumption and is driving down category dollars. We plan to improve our volume trends in 2024 by narrowing price gaps, increasing promotions and, importantly, through distribution wins. Recipe mixes in the Americas showed increased stress from crossing key price points due to previous pricing actions. We have a plan to address these to return to volume growth. In our flavors product category, some of our consumer packaged food group customers experienced greater softness in volumes within their own business, more than we expected in both the Americas and EMEA. Finally, our growth of quick service restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Within Asia Pacific, some of our customers are experiencing boycotts in Southeast Asia related to geopolitical events. We are monitoring the situation and anticipate continued softness in these customer's volume to continue into 2024. Turning to what met our expectations in the quarter; we drove volume growth for a second quarter in a row in America spices and seasonings. In branded food service, our growth was strong across the portfolio driven by volume. In Asia Consumer, our recovery from COVID-related disruptions in China was in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. Outside of China, for the quarter, our volume growth was strong across all categories. In EMEA Consumer, consistent with the third quarter, pricing actions contributed to double digit growth, which pressured volumes. Now I'd like to further build on some of the initiatives within our growth levers, notably increased brand marketing, targeted price gap management, new products and packaging renovation, which have already proven to strengthen our volume trends in key areas. We have intentionally chosen our investments in these areas as we believe they will generate the most significant returns. We are confident our investments will continue to drive improved results in 2024, and we expect to invest more, positioning us further for success in 2025 and going forward. First, America's spices and seasonings is a priority investment area for us, given our category leadership and its profitable growth potential for both McCormick and our customers. Our initiatives are driving U.S. branded sales volume growth, which strength during the fourth quarter in holiday performance. And looking at consumption, we continue to sequentially improve share trends again in the fourth quarter both in terms of dollars and units. We continue to activate initiatives of price gap management, innovation, packaging and a meaningful step-up in brand marketing support for America's spices and seasonings. And the results have begun to materialize, demonstrating that we have the right plans and are taking the right actions to grow in this attractive category. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday herb and spice portfolio, which began in the second quarter of 2023, continues to roll out according to plan. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had shifted about 75% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have fully transitioned on shelf experienced stronger velocity. We are pleased with our results to date, which increased our confidence that this renovation will be a strong contribution to our growth in 2024 as our customers' shelves continue to transition. We are making progress on restoring distribution that was lost due to past supply issues. We have secured wins and new distribution. We expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results mid-2024, coinciding with most of our customers' shelf resets. Overall, we have a robust set of initiatives in flight and anticipate making progress throughout the year. I would expect growth in share gains in units and volume to lead our trends. Spending a moment on spices and seasonings and other key markets. Similar initiatives as in the U.S. are driving volume growth and share gains in Canada, France and Australia. We also renovated our spice and herb portfolio in Southeast Asia, with the same innovative packaging as the U.S. and EMEA, and began shipping the new products in the fourth quarter. We are supporting this transition with increased marketing spend in the first quarter. Next, in branded foodservice, we achieved strong volume growth across all customer segments. Our foodservice operators continue to expand their value menu options, and they are turning to our products to deliver great taste for a fraction of their costs. We drove share gains in spices and seasonings as well as our hot sauce share of tabletop, with expanded distribution, new products, customer wins and increased menu penetration, as well as our expertise in heat. Heat continues to be a growth accelerator globally for total McCormick, outpacing the rest of the portfolio as customers and consumers alike continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. New products contributed to fourth quarter growth. For instance, in the U.S., our Cholula salsas in the Mexican aisle are building distribution and bringing new consumers to the category. And our branded food service items, Frank's Mild Wings Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot continue to perform at. In the U.K., Australia, we are driving hot sauce category growth with Cholula gaining momentum on shelf. In the U.S., we secured new hot sauce distribution during the quarter. And in the first quarter, we are launching new Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format, as well as our national launch of Frank's Dill Pickle. We are well positioned going into our Super Bowl merchandising period. In summary, our investments in the key areas I just highlighted favorably impacted both our volume and margin performance for the quarter. Moving to gross margin. We are pleased with our performance, which continued to improve as the year progressed. Our results reflect effective price realization, the optimization of our cost structure and favorable product mix, driven by our portfolio optimization and focus in key areas. While confident in our ability to return to our historical margin profile in the near term, we will use improvements in our profitability to fuel continued investments in our business to drive our top line. We are in a strong position to benefit from the virtuous flywheel of margin expansion given the work that's been done throughout the business, and we are able to intentionally focus our investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. Reflecting on our full year 2023 performance, I am proud of the progress we made in advancing our business in the right direction and our team is focused on returning to our long-term growth algorithm, strengthening our margins, significantly improving our cash flow, paying down our debt and reducing our leverage ratio. All have put McCormick in a position of strength to further invest with a focus on growth. Our foundation is strong. We have proven and powerful brands, and the results we are seeing from our refined and strengthened plans provide confidence in the effectiveness of our strategies and investments. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we expect volume trends to improve throughout the year and volume growth during the second half, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. The pace of margin recovery to historical levels will take time as our focus is on investing to drive sustainable sales growth to generate quality earnings for years to come. I also want to highlight on share performance, that we are approaching our plans differently with an even greater competitive posture and more intentionality towards driving growth in our key categories. Now, let me highlight some ways in which we will drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Starting in our Consumer segment with category management, where a key capability is revenue management, we have been building our discipline in revenue management for several years and have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. As you would expect, this has become even more important in recent years. In the current environment, we are taking a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors, accelerating our efforts across various products and are seeing results. In our spices and seasonings category, we selected individual items we believe would be the most responsive based on the elasticities we were experiencing. For instance, in our iconic Black Pepper and Vanilla product lines, our actions proved to be effective. We are recapturing buyers, increasing household penetration and are driving profitable volume growth that is outpacing the category volume growth in these product lines. As I mentioned earlier, across key price points in Americas recipe mixes and are also leaning into our revenue management execution in this category. For example, in the fourth quarter, we focused on gravy as a key holiday item, which drove results, contributing to our successful holiday season. We expect to see further results from our actions as we work through the portfolio. Across all markets, our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. These investments we make in price gap management result in greater volumes and improved margins over time. Importantly, customers that are adopting our recommendations are seeing better category performance, and McCormick is driving volume and share growth in their respective businesses. We are prioritizing brand marketing connecting with consumers and fueling growth with our increased investments. We have a history of investing behind our brands and did so again in 2023. We plan for a strong start to 2024, with aggressive first quarter brand marketing investments which are well underway. We expect a significant increase for the year, concentrated to the first half. We will continue to invest across various channels. We plan to further drive household penetration and increase buy rates with additional focus in retail media. Our first quarter plans include an increased Christmas holiday campaigns in all regions, increasing our value-focused messaging for our everyday spices and seasonings and recipe mix in the U.S. Also, supporting our packaging renovations that I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Southeast Asia, and promoting our new products in EMEA. Turning to new products, which are a key growth driver in both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. In the Consumer segment, our 2023 launches are expected to substantially contribute to growth in 2024. For instance, in EMEA, we are thrilled with the early results from our range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes that we launched with Nadiya Hussain, a British celebrity chef, as we entered the fourth quarter. We are expanding our household penetration, bringing in new and younger households into the brand. The recipe mixes in this range contributed along with other new products and expanded distribution to our fourth quarter growth in U.K. recipe mixes, which was double the category rate. In Flavor Solutions, collaborating with our customers on innovation continues to be a key driver of success. Across the portfolio, our customers continue to focus on innovation to meet consumers' needs. We are winning in flavors with better-for-you products and on-trend flavors; and, in branded foodservice, with our heat platform and value-oriented products for foodservice operators. We are pleased with our 2023 performance from new products, which contributed to our sales growth and accelerate compared to the prior year, as we expected. Importantly, we have a strong lineup of new products spanning heat, freshness, value, convenience and flavor exploration in our Consumer segment for 2024, which we will share more about at CAGNY in February. And in Flavor Solutions, we are also carrying a robust pipeline of new products into 2024, positioning McCormick and our customers for success. We are leveraging our proprietary technologies and Flavor Solutions to support our innovation to win share in attractive high-growth categories and to attract new customers. In addition, with our differentiated customer engagement approach, we are intentionally targeting a mid-market customer base who are category leaders in high-growth innovators as well as diversifying our customer base to drive share gains across our portfolio and profitable growth. Our actions are yielding results. For instance, in the fourth quarter, our volume growth in performance nutrition significantly outpaced the market. And in the beverage category, we drove sales growth even though the category decelerated, partially by targeting high-value and high-growth segments within beverage. With our flavor leadership and continued investments, we are fully committed to vigorously fuel category growth with our differentiated portfolio. We have confidence in our plans, which we'll build throughout the year and yield volume growth during the back half of the year. We are dedicating more resources to categories where we have the right to continue to win. We are seeing our actions drive momentum and solid results in areas where we have focused. We believe that the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, our categories and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now before I turn it over to Mike to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance and 2024 outlook, I would like to comment on recent changes in our Board of Directors. Freeman Hrabowski who has served as a Director for 27 years, will be retiring from the Board as of the end of March. I am grateful for his service and contributions, which has significantly benefited McCormick, and we will miss him. I also want to welcome Terry Thomas, who has joined our Board. Terry brings extensive global consumer product industry expertise through his current role as Chief Growth Officer for Flowers Foods, and his experience at Unilever prior to that. I look forward to working with Terry and the contributions he will make to McCormick. Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments on Slide 25. Our business is moving in the right direction, we strengthened our margins, significantly improved our cash flow and are deleveraging ahead of expectations. From a top line perspective, volume trends improved sequentially through the third quarter, but fourth quarter performance was disappointing. Parts of our portfolio grew underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working. In areas that were challenged, we know the drivers and are addressing those that we control. And combined with the initiatives we have in place, we fully expect we will drive improved trends and build to volume growth during the second half of 2024. We are committed to recovering our margins in both segments to historical levels, while making investments to drive sustainable top line growth. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place. And we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in 2024 and beyond. I am excited for the year ahead, which will be my first full year as CEO. I plan to drive an ambitious agenda with greater competitive posture and more intentionality that capitalize on our strong business fundamentals as well as the value of our brands and capabilities and have driven our past success. McCormick is a growth company, a global leader in flavor, with a long-term orientation and a strong culture. I am committed to advance our leadership and our differentiation. Our strategic pillars: growth, performance and people, remain consistent. I am energized to further incorporate my mark on our growth plans. In a fast-changing global environment, we need to build on our competitive strengths and opportunities to remain a differentiated market leader. As such, I would like to share the five priorities that the entire McCormick organization is rallying behind, as we enter 2024. First, strengthen our global leadership in core categories. That means, growing volume and market share in herbs, spices and seasonings and condiments, strengthening our leadership in heat and increasing the global scale of our flavors business and expanding our branded foodservice business. Second, drive profitable growth and higher returns on investments. We want to restore the operating margin we have lost the last several years. But importantly, do so in a measured way, using our cost savings and operating leverage to fuel top line growth in the near-term that will drive sustainable profits for years to come. Third, accelerate our digital transformation to enhance how we serve consumers and customers to work faster and more efficiently, and to strengthen decision-making by further leveraging data and insights. Fourth, continue to elevate our power of people culture and build the next generation of leaders and capabilities that will drive McCormick's success well into future years. And finally, all these contribute to our fifth priority, which is to strengthen and expand stem competitive advantages to make McCormick even more effective in the marketplace. Our advantages are critical to ensuring we deliver on our growth potential. Simply put, I am committed to harnessing the collective expertise of our talented McCormick team with a renewed sense of urgency and speed to deliver on these priorities, resulting in long-term sustainable profitable growth that will be industry-leading. While 2024 is an important year of investments, we are confident in our capabilities and enthusiastic about some early signposts of success. And we are committed to returning to the type of growth that investors expect from McCormick. The foundation has been laid and building blocks are in place, and I look forward to sharing more about them at CAGNY in February. As I said, I am excited for the year ahead and delivering on our long-term objectives. Finally, before turning to your questions, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2023, and the momentum they are carrying into 2024, and reiterate my confidence that, together, we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now for your questions. Good morning, Andrew. Well, Andrew, thanks for the question. Let me start by commenting on how we ended 2023 from a volume perspective. While the fourth quarter was below our expectations, there were bright spots, because our actions are working in a number of categories that are critical for us. And for the challenging area, you know what the issues are, and I'm pleased with the speed and urgency with which the team is addressing them.  I guess just to step back, pre-pandemic, we consistently drove volume growth across our business in both segments. And the macro dynamics of the last several years disrupted this. And so we see 2024 as an important moment to get back there as soon as we can. We do have a bias towards even greater investment on the business. And as I've said, we're approaching our plans differently with even greater competitive posture, greater intentionality towards driving volume growth and share in those key and really attractive categories. I think where we stand at this point in 2024 is we appear to be moving beyond those macro dynamics. Yet at the same time, we recognize the uncertainty of the environment, and therefore, I'm taking a cautious view on that outlook. From a consumption standpoint, we do expect to exit 2024 in a stronger position than how we exited in 2023. And importantly, though, we're also entering 2024 in a position of strength in terms of our ability to invest in the business and expand margins. So we're able to intentionally focus those investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. We expect our volumes to improve as we progress through the year and to drive the volume growth during the second half. This momentum is expected to continue into 2025, notwithstanding any new surprises on sort of the macroeconomic headwinds that might be out there. And I believe our investments will drive quality earnings growth and will put us on a trajectory of -- on that long-term algorithm. So those are the -- that's the way we're thinking about exiting '23, how we're thinking about '24 and as we go into '25. Well, as I said, we're entering '24 in a position of strength after navigating these dynamics over the last several years. And I'll turn it over to Mike just to give some context, and I'll wrap it up with a few other thoughts. Mike said on sort of this portfolio optimization, we really do see that working. So we did make a couple of intentional moves as you know. That's really, I think, allowing us to invest even more in the part of the portfolio, which we know will be the strongest. And then we did make a lot of targeted investments in '23. So that's yielding results. We like where that's going. And it's achieving high ROI, and that's carrying us into '24. So I do believe this intentional investment in those categories that are core to us will really be the biggest drivers of profitable growth. And we should see that margin accretion from that mix of sales. So we really do believe we're operating in a position of strength there. Good morning. I think to maybe one point. As we get the price differentials right, the advertising is even more effective. And that's important. And we're happy with the ROIs on our A&P, but it gets even better when you have the right price differential, as we've seen with Black Pepper, Vanilla and other categories. On China, and just a little bit of context here, our food away from home business, which is included in Asia Pacific Consumer, it definitely will \u2013 we expect to see slower demand, especially sort of in the first half of the year. But we do expect overall China sales in 2024 to be comparable to 2023. But maybe for some more additional context, Mike and I spent a week in China in early January, just actually a few weeks ago just visiting our teams there and assessing dense conditions. And I would say, broadly, our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious. There's a number of indicators that kind of point to this. There's high unemployment with young adults, low consumer confidence. We see consumers with a reluctance to spend. And uniquely in our business, we tend to serve the smaller independent restaurants, particularly in Central China, and we see them losing traffic to larger chains and QSRs, because they're really driving either really strong value or they're winning on just even more store growth overall. And so we see this playing out in the retail category there, especially with the modern trade. Just to share a quick anecdote, as we were there, I took one afternoon just to walk around and actually I forgot the pack a tie, So I had to go buy a tie and go to an apartment store. What struck me was really a lot of movement in people outside than on the streets. And I want to go get a cup of coffee. It's kind of empty. Go to the department store, not spoke with anybody almost. And so there's just not really a lot of active spending. We see a lot of people out and about the mobilities there, and it's returned, but we're not seeing the spending. And I think it's broadly sort of an example of what we are observing as we were in the market there. Having said that though, like we do in other regions, we do have plans to really address the change in trends with the Chinese consumer. And we do expect our Flavor Solutions business to be a bit stronger this year just due to the QSR trends. But we do expect a gradual recovery in China, starting probably more in the second half of 2024. And the exact pace of growth will really be determined by how that macroeconomic parameter kind of plays out and consumer confidence plans over the next few quarters. But we really do continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of this market and are working to strengthen those plans as we go through 2024. Good morning. Well, Alexia, thanks for the question. We never really project exactly what to expect and share, because there's just a lot of dynamics that might happen at the shelf. But I would point to how we're talking about volume and our outlook on volume as we think about the first half, the second half and as we expect to kind of grow volume in the back half of the year. That certainly will have an influence on what we see play out in share performance. But we tend not to sort of specifically tell you. I don't think that there is a specific quarter I can tell you when that's going to happen. Well, good morning, Max, I'll maybe kick it off with some context around your question on sales and consumption and sort of the state of the consumer, and I'll pass it over to Mike for commentary on -- I think you had a question there with regard to margin. But I think we are taking a cautious view with regard to where the consumer is right now. And that's really informed by what we saw in Q4. We just saw a little bit more shifting, particularly as you think about how the quarter played out and if you think about consumption trends, we saw consumers really pulled back in September and October, and then really wait until right before the holidays to really make a lot of their purchases. And we even see -- saw similar indications leading up to Christmas. So, what's underneath that, I think, is people were certainly holding off there, making a lot more trips to the store, buying a lot fewer items and units. And maybe even smaller units actually started to come true, I think, from a consumer trend standpoint. And I think we just have to acknowledge that this is a little bit different than what we saw in the summer. It was a little bit more pronounced. Certainly, it affected our trends as we kind of been really clear about. And so it's prudent for us to just take a cautious view where the consumer is going to be going here in early 2024. And so we felt like it was best to recognize that in our outlook, particularly as we think about the first half of the year. But we're also going to be putting in more investment in the business, more A&P. So we expect also to be able to meet the consumer where they are right now and really try to focus on our game plan, which is to drive volume growth. Mike, do you want to add... Yes. Would you mind repeating the margin question, I didn't quite get that. Yes. I mean we're confident in our CCI and GOE programs. I mean we've baked -- low single-digit inflation environment, like I said before, which we have good line of sight generally for the rest of the year, gives us more confidence there. First quarter is going to be our highest cost increase. And we see it petering down after that and our pricing is going to be the highest in the first quarter, too. Generally, I think what I'd say, if you think about last year with our GOE programs, we met our targets. Actually, we exceeded a bit our external targets. We were a bit prudent because -- but we met our internal target. So I would say being prudent is the word of the day. And love to over-deliver if we could. But we also realized in this environment, making investments on price gap management and A&P is really important. So we'll assess that as the year goes on. Good morning Steve. Sure, Steve. Our growth momentum in Flavor Solutions was pretty exceptional, I think, throughout the year in 2023 with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and slight volume growth there. But even with the deceleration in the fourth quarter, we had pretty strong organic growth throughout 2023. And we do expect to continue to make really good progress there. Although, we're not going to be in double digits, I think, in 2024, but still making really good progress. To give you maybe more of a regional consideration, as I think through the portfolio. In the Americas, we continue to drive strong branded foodservice volume. And in flavors, particularly in a number of the categories that we tend to have some strong performance and like performance nutrition and beverage, we see continued strong performance in volume. And I think that we would expect that to continue into 2024. Across the rest of the flavor product category, a lot of our growth was impacted by the softness of our customers' performance in the market with regard to units and volume. And we saw a little bit more drop than we would have expected, not inconsistent with our own consumer business. And so while we're disappointed in that softness, we still believe our results are pretty good in this area. I think that's the chance of that continuing to 2024, probably likely. In EMEA, as we mentioned in our third quarter call, that our customers there are, both for packaged goods and also quick serve restaurants, are experiencing softness in their volumes within their business, too. And we anticipated that in the fourth quarter. However, there's even maybe a little bit more than what we expected. So almost like a similar theme to what I said about the U.S. And so we expect some softness related there as we enter in Q1. But we're optimistic, again, that we'll continue to sort of improve every quarter as we go through 2024. And then in Asia Pacific, our growth that was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic. Some of that really had to do with just unrelated matters, but some boycotts issues that we're seeing in Southeast Asia. But we saw some nice performance in China, so I would expect that to continue in 2024 and some trends. So that's just some context around Flavor Solutions. Okay. Good morning. Well, with so much has changed since 2019, I think that -- if I think about the entirety of all the different levers and variables that you were talking about, whether it's price elasticity or volume and where the consumer is, there's been reasonably enough significant change that. As we take a look at our categories, we're taking a look at in terms of how they're performing today and where we need to go in order to drive volume growth. And as we said earlier, that's a component of increased A&P. A lot of that advertising focused on talking about value. Parts of our portfolio, we know that price gap management can have a really effective impact on turning around unit volume trends. And so I think that's an indication of where the consumer is right now. If you look at unit volume performance, either in our business or probably the category, pricing has had an impact, and we have to acknowledge that. Having said that, though, if I compare our business organically, and product mix, compared to 2019, our total organic volume is about the same as 2019. We haven't really lost significant volume or on product mix since pre-pandemic. And so I think that's one sort of consideration to have is, while there's been a lot of change in many ups and downs, I think, if you think about all these macro dynamic impacts we've been going through, we find ourselves in a similar volume position as we were in 2019. I don't -- I think I might have provided the context that you're looking for. Well, as I think about our competitive posture in Flavor Solutions, I feel really good about it. It starts with having great capabilities in technology and a great team. And I think we do have a differentiated approach towards driving growth, particularly in flavors and seasonings in that part of our business. From a technology standpoint, we continue to win and sort of there's -- a lot of categories that we operate in there that we're targeting because they're positive and high growth. And we also tend to get a good mix of large customers and moderately in small-sized customers who tend to be characterized by much even higher growth. As we think about that as a portfolio mix of customers, we're seeing a lot of strength coming from that. And I would just point to our Boeing trends throughout '23. And as we think about '24 to be an indication of how we think we're performing relative to the market there overall. And so those are some indications. Now, the other one on top of that would be heat. And we continue to see growth through heat. We continue to see that as a as the part of that portfolio, if you will, it tends to grow at an even higher rate just due to where consumers are. And we talked a lot about heat extensively in terms of how popular it is. And so that's another reason to believe that we feel like we're competitively poised in this part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's one that's receiving a lot of increased investment, too, as we think about building capacity, technology and really growing to global scale. Largely, I think it's a product of price gaps that we can manage to. But I think your observations would align with ours in that it isn't strictly an issue regarding private label or other branded competition. I think it's really an attractive category that has always received new competitors and new entrants. And so we look broadly when we think about competition in that part of our portfolio, as being -- and at the shelf is both watching those gaps versus private label and also branded competitors. Good morning Rob. Hello. We do. I mean we look at that annually. And it's part of our strategic planning process. And so yes, we do spend time making sure we understand how that's performing. But I think your 5% to 7%, I think, is -- or actually you said 4% to 6%, but I would tell you it's generally around those same numbers. We tend to think about it is 5% to 7% at a global level. No, I would urge you not to take away that as an indication that the category is weaker. This is still a very attractive category. Also appreciate that the category at the global level has also gone through a lot of inflation in pricing and similar factors, but we still see this as a very attractive category for the total company. And so that is not the view that we take, particularly with the data that we look at. And so I think maybe that got at the heart of your question. It's harder to quantify because it's \u2013 we know how much we're shipping out in terms of our total portfolio that's getting this new package. And so as I said, that number is at 75%. And that, we feel that's \u2013 we're pretty accurate about that. But now the reflection on shelf, as all this inventory is flowing in on shelf, that's happening on a lag to that 75% number. We expect it to just continue to increase through the first half of the year. I think through the first half of the year, we should largely be caught up to that number to specific standpoint, too. If you walk into a store today, you're going to see on the shelf some in the old package, some of the new package, and that's just maybe an indication of how you might think about flow-through overall. However, I will tell you that as we do look at specific accounts and locations where we know we're seeing a lot of that flow through already have occurred, we are seeing a nice pickup in velocity as we would have expected to be the case, because we've seen this package perform in EMEA in a similar way. And it really does deliver on the SKUs for freshness for consumers and really kind of takes it up a notch in terms of the overall benefit and offering that we're providing consumers. So we feel pretty good about that. What you'll also hear us talk about is we're going to start to move other parts of the product line into this package, too, beginning in the back half of 2024. So we're not done. But this part of our line that we've been speaking about since mid-last year is still in the process of flowing through on shelf. I think we were, Rob, if I'm not mistaken... 3% to 4% range for 2023. Know that underneath that, we tend to see working media grow a lot faster than that, because we're also offsetting it with other productivity and taking out more nonworking investments. But 2023 is in that range. Now 2024 though, is in the double-digit range. And we feel really good about that where we're putting that investment. The only thing I'll add on top of what Mike just said with regard to just that constant focus against improving margin. We're also -- as we continue to shift customers to higher-margin product lines, more insulated technology, et cetera, it allows us to continue to grow margin too. But I think Mike pretty much nailed it there. And that's our outlook on it. It's still pretty positive. And it's just going to take us a little bit longer, as we've been calling out really ever since, I think, last year."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting 5% of pricing benefit, offset by a 3% volume mix decline. As Brendan mentioned, our volume performance was impacted by changes in consumers' behavior. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales were flat, reflecting a 4% increase from pricing actions, offset by a 4% volume decline. The benefit from our recovery in China and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins netted to no overall impact for the total Consumer segment. On Slide 11, consumer sales in the Americas decreased 4% in constant currency with the DSD exit I just mentioned driving 2% of that decline. The remaining sales decline was due to lower volume and product mix in several areas of the portfolio, including, as Brendan mentioned, prepared foods, mustard and recipe mixes, which was partially offset by volume growth in spices and seasonings, which was driven by our investments. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Sales growth was broad-based across markets and categories. We remain at an elevated pricing environment in EMEA, and we expect volumes to improve as pricing wins in 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region increased 31%, driven by a 26% volume increase, primarily due to the expected recovery in China. Outside of China, we also drove double-digit sales growth with strong volume and broad-based growth across all categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 14. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 5%, reflecting a 7% increase from pricing, offset by a 2% decrease from volume and product mix. Our growth momentum in this segment was exceptional through the third quarter. And even with a deceleration in the fourth quarter, our sales growth for the year was strong. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales rose 6%, driven by pricing, as volume and product mix was comparable to the prior year. Sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio and led by branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 2%, and with pricing actions contributing 14%, partially offset by a 3% impact from the divestiture of the Giotti canning business, a 9% decline in all other volume due to softness in some of our customers' volumes within their own businesses and a 1% impact from exiting a private label product line. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with a 6% contribution from pricing, offset by a 1% volume decline. Our business in China delivered strong growth. Outside of China, sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts in some of our quick service restaurant customers, as Brendan mentioned. As seen on Slide 18, gross profit margin expanded 320 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix in both segments and our CCI and GOE programs, as well as effective price realization. Additionally, we lapped elevated costs related to some discrete issues and flavor solutions operations. Overall, we ended 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and the year. Now moving to Slide 19. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A, increased relative to the fourth quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect to invest further in 2024 to support our brands. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 190 basis points. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment was flat. And in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased $0.73 in constant currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in the fourth quarter, as expected, we drove significant margin expansion versus prior year in this segment. For the total company, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points in the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the year, which reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make investments early in 2024 to fuel top-line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 20. Our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact this year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the fourth quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business contributed meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 22, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85 as compared to $0.73 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by gross margin expansion and the results from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture I just mentioned. On Slide 23, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in 2023, $1.2 billion, nearly double our cash flow of $652 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $419 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $264 million for capital expenditures in 2023. Our capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. We expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. We are well-positioned to continue paying down debt and coupled with ending 2023 and with a leverage ratio slightly above our 2024 year-end target of 3 times. We are pleased to be deleveraging faster than expected. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 24. Our 2024 outlook reflects our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. We are well positioned with our cost savings programs to fuel investments for volume growth as well as generate operating margin expansion. The balancing of margin expansion and investments to drive growth is critical to our success, not only in 2024, but also into 2025 and beyond as we remain committed and confident in our long-term algorithm. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. On the top line, we expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth.  We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year. First, we expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we are expecting to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. We have made strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth that will also impact volumes during the year. We decided to exit DSD of our bagged Hispanic spices in Americas consumer and to exit a private label product line in EMEA Flavor Solutions, both will impact the first quarter. And we divested the Giotti canning business, which will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business through the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. And finally, in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our China business. Moving to gross margin. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and the cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new flavor solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by our investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year and weighted more to the first quarter. Overall, based on the flow-through of our volume expectations and the timing of our investments, we expect our profit to be less robust in the first half and anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring discrete items. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick De Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023, or 5% to 7% in constant currency. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook. Yes. Good morning, Andrew. Yes, as you saw from our results, we ended the year with strong operating margin performance, and for the full year, up 100 basis points. A big key to our recovery was recovering the cost increases through pricing. Obviously, 20% cost increases two years ago, over 10% last year, there was a big job to do that. So we're able to do that in 2023, which helped our margins. Our CCI and GOE programs, we've talked about a lot, really performed and give a strong momentum, frankly, into 2024. 2024, as you think about this year, we're showing some margin improvement about 80 basis points. And with low single-digit inflation, and you think about four or five years ago when we had low single-digit inflation, CCI really works for us. You take a little bit of pricing and we're having some pricing wrap in 2024 and then you can decide what to do with. And CCI, some of it drops to the bottom line through margin improvement, we're making those increased revenue price cap investments, which we've always done some degree of that, but also our brand A&P up -- double digits is another way we're using CCI this year. So it's kind of a sweet spot for us at low single-digit inflation environment as we think about it. And the portfolio optimization we've talked about last year, which -- a bit of that continues into this year. So, again, helping drive our margins up. We want to recover over time the gross profit margins we had pre-pandemic, but we're doing it judiciously. Okay. Let me kick off and -- a couple of questions in there. The first, I think, had to do with just promotional lifts and what we're seeing. And I'm not necessarily trying to compare to the comments of other companies. But what we're seeing right now in our business today is we're not seeing huge declines or sort of reduced significant lifts of promotion. But there's an important consideration there, which is we're really a heavy base business. We don't have a ton of, if you think about our percentage of consumption. We're in the 90% range in terms of base consumption and the rest is really coming through promotions. So we're not overly reliant there. And I would just say that it's probably an area that I don't know that it's fair to draw a correlation between our performance and others. Now price gap management, in terms of how we're approaching that, we're looking across our portfolio. And just in the case of like spices and seasonings, it's a really broad portfolio with many subcategories underneath there. And each and every item -- you take compare black pepper to Montreal Steak they all have different price elasticities and where the consumer is to go. And so we have been surgically looking at this at a SKU level to make sure that we're doing the right thing to really drive overall growth in volume and unit consumption. And so that's allowed us to really, I think, be very, very sharp about how we drive this investment in a targeted way to make sure that we're starting to drive volume growth. In 2023, we saw a lot of improvement in parts of our business where we started to apply this. And I think like I said on the call, a good example was Black Pepper or Vanilla, and we started to really see the -- not only the volume of the unit share gain. And so that gave us really, I think, a lot of kind of stair-step into those investments. And that's the way we're going to do it in 2024 too. We're expanding that investment. We're going to continue to look at the line, we assess it. Honestly, every month and taking a look at where we see the individual products perform across the shelf. And then we decide what we need to do from a revenue and category standpoint. But I wanted to put on top of that, we're applying more A&P to the business, too, at the same time. And I think that's really important. We are seeing really good performance from A&P and it encourages us to continue to spend more on the business. And so you'll see more of that from us, I think, going forward. I'm not sure if I captured all your questions there, but let me know if I did. Good morning. Hi, Alexia, yes, it's around 1% for Q1, but then it really Peters out the rest of the year. So very small the rest of the year. But 1% for Q1 as we lapped the decisions we made last year. I mean the pricing, Max, is really focused on the first half a bit more in the first quarter based on the timing of our pricing. I mean, the volume growth is sequential across both segments. And as you know, based on our fourth quarter performance, Flavor Solutions is exiting the year a little better trajectory than -- or at least based than Consumer. So as you model those things, you think about sequential improvement to get to that zero to negative two volume growth kind of the first half, second half story. And then pricing is really heavily weighted to the first half, primarily the first quarter. Yes, Steve, it's Mike. I'll take that. And if Brendan has any comments, he'll layer then in. I mean we talk about pricing for the full year being around 1%, and that includes our price gap management, too. So don't miss that point. And as you think about the first quarter, as I said before, that's the majority of the lapping of last year's pricing. First quarter, first half, that's where a lot of the price activities come through, so less so in the second six. So I'd say that for the full year, we're comfortable with pricing at one, I don't know what math you're looking at to make it negative, but I don't see that, honestly, for the full year. And from a -- and really by segment, too, you've got to think about it too. I mean Flavor Solutions is going to be a bit higher than 1%. Consumer is going to be a little bit lower from a pricing perspective. So we're managing it very closely. And we're comfortable with the full year guidance. Hi Matt, its Mike. I mean they're not materially different between segments to be honest. So the 50 to 100 basis points at the gross margin line and approximately 80 at the OP margin line. To your point, there are some price gap management items within the Consumer business, but there's also portfolio optimization, the GOE and CCI numbers which hit both segments. So I would say not materially different. That gives us belief in the sequential building of volume during 2024 into the second half, as you alluded to. 3% to 4% range, yes. Yes, that's great. Let me take that one, Rob, and maybe summarize it all for you. And as you've pointed out, the sequential improvement in volume we see from the fourth quarter, also considered, Consumer starting at a slightly lower place in flavor solutions. So as you model that, build that into your model and build throughout the year. Pricing actions are primarily first -- the lapping of that primarily first half related. Maybe concentrated, I'd say, in the first quarter. However, cost in the first quarter, we're still seeing high single-digit inflation. It does go down to averaging of low single-digit inflation for the year, but there is a spike -- not a spike, but the highest level will be in the first quarter at high single-digit inflation. We get a bit of favorable product mix in the first quarter due to some of the initiatives we're talking about. But we're also seeing some of the negatives from an investment in price gap initiatives in Q1 primarily. So, as we think about pricing, a bit of that will be offset within the price gap management activities. GOE had a little bit of favorability to the wrap from last year in the first half, a bit in the first quarter too. And then as you mentioned, brand marketing up double digits in the first quarter is something that we're really driving toward. And not to forget tax, sometimes we do with tax. It's 22% for the year, but we see a higher tax rate in the first quarter and getting better as the year goes on. And don't forget, unfavorable FX throughout the whole year of about 1%. Hi Rob, it's Mike. I'll start and Brendan can add. You're right. We've been on a journey with Flavor Solutions. I can remember, it wasn't 15 years ago, but we were at a 6% OP margin. And we really, through focused cost initiatives, portfolio management, we're able to get that to over 14% pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And we had aspirations for higher because our peers in the flavor industry are higher than that. And we still do aspire to those higher numbers. Obviously, COVID, the pricing costing relationship, that took over 300 basis points as we priced to cost. We did margin up that took -- that's over a 300 basis point impact on our margins there. So we've said we're going to build that back overtime through initiatives like CCI and things like that. We've had early success. I mean with the pricing initiatives we had last year in 2023, we took our operating margin from 8% in 2022 to 10% and 2023, granted still below where we were, but we see positive movement this year as we think about our total margin. I said both segments will see positive operating margin improvement. And we're in the process -- for Flavor Solutions, it's a pretty large number. As we are transitioning our large U.K. manufacturing facility, 2024 and 2025, you'll see some favorable tailwinds there which will help Flavor Solutions' margin. But to your point, and Brendan talked about, the focus on those great growing categories in the flavor side of the business, those are generally higher margin, they're stickier. That is our strategy that will help us drive our margins going forward."

To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides on our IR website. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statement slide for more information. I'll now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to join you today for my first earnings call as President and CEO. Just over one month into my new role, I am energized by our underlying business trends, which reinforce our competitive advantages and differentiation. Let's turn to our results. We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Our results were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding challenges for our Consumer segment in Asia Pacific, or APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery been slower than previously anticipated. Let me start with the highlights for the third quarter. We delivered solid constant currency sales growth. We continued to realize effective price realization, and importantly, volume performance, excluding China, has improved each quarter throughout the year. We continued to see top-line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Year-to-date cash flow from operations more than doubled relative to the prior year due to higher operating income and working capital improvements. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our business fundamentals and the effective execution of our proven strategies while leveraging the sustained demand for flavor. Turning to Slide 5. In the third quarter, we drove 6% sales growth in constant currency, demonstrating the strength of our broad global portfolio. Our constant currency growth reflected strong business performance, with an 8% contribution from pricing and a 2% decline in volume and product mix. This decline in volume was driven by two factors: a 1% volume decline attributable to the impact of a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China; and a 1% decline related to the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and the pruning of low-margin business to optimize our portfolio. All other underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 1%. I would like to now share a few highlights on gross margin and operating income for the quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail. We drove strong gross margin improvement year-over-year, reflecting continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged last year, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. We remain focused on improving our margins over the long term and believe that our recovery will be a continuous build. And we expect to return to historical levels and believe there is a runway beyond that, recognizing it will take some time. Higher gross profit for the quarter was partially offset by lower-than-expected performance in China as well as higher SG&A. As planned, we continue to build back incentive compensation and increased brand marketing investments. The net impact was a 5% increase in adjusted operating income versus the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results year-to-date. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our focused approach to optimizing our cost structure, reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory during the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving into the fourth quarter, we can continue to expect top-line momentum across our portfolio, including growth in China, as we lap the COVID-related disruptions. China's growth, however, is expected to be less than originally anticipated, which, when combined with its year-to-date performance, has led to a lower full year 2023 benefit than we originally expected. Despite this impact, however, we are reaffirming our sales outlook and now anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range. We are reaffirming our operating income outlook, which highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our business, excluding China. Demand is strong. We are driving improvement in our margin profile and are optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now for our performance by segment. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 7. We saw solid results across the Americas and EMEA, which were tempered by our APAC region due to China, as I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding China, we are pleased with our underlying performance. Now for some highlights by regions. First, in the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew approximately 4%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of DSD, Direct-Store-Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices. There is a minor difference between our sales and consumption, which is attributable to listing fees for a significant increase in new distribution and new products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions. Importantly, our categories remain advantaged in terms of growth relative to overall macro trends, and we are well positioned to drive future growth. The fundamental strength of the spices and seasonings category is evident as cooking at home has remained elevated since pre-COVID and consumers have an increasing demand for flavor. U.S. spices and seasonings growth is continuing to outpace the total edible category in units and dollars. We have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions to grow market share in this very attractive and competitive category. We have made progress and shown improvement relative to the beginning of the year. We continue to restore distribution, which was lost because of supply issues. As we look at our performance and our trends, we are happy to see total distribution point growth in the third quarter. We also continue to be pleased that our assortment on shelf is more productive than pre-COVID. In addition, we have significant new distribution and innovation that is starting to come online as customers reset their shelves. As we've said before, restoration will take some time and we expect to drive growth as we continue to progress. In addition to driving distribution gains, we have a continued focus on supporting our brands and optimizing pricing. As you would expect, this has become a more important part of our category management efforts in recent years. Our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns, as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. Our efforts are yielding results. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday spice and herb portfolio is rolling out according to plan. At the end of the third quarter, we have shipped about 40% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have transitioned on shelf have seen high-teens improvement in velocity. And our significant brand marketing campaign featuring the benefits of the new packaging ramped up at the end of the third quarter leading into the holiday season. Our larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continues to gain share. We saw strong performance in the third quarter, driven by pricing and higher unit volume. Expanded distribution has been a major driver for our performance, as well as consumers that are seeking value and trading up to larger sizes. We have the right assortment in this environment. Our household penetration on larger sizes is greater than pre-COVID. We are confident this product line will continue to drive growth as we expand distribution further and launch new line extensions. Our grilling performance was strong this quarter, supported by our Fire Up campaign as well as contribution for new product launches that we discussed on our earnings call in June. Frank's RedHot sauces, French's mustard and Stubb's Bar-B-Q sauces and rubs, as well as Lawry's marinades, all delivered significant growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year. We drove double-digit sales growth with contributions from pricing and volume across our total grilling portfolio. And we drove market share gains in mustard, barbecue sauce and marinades in the third quarter. Our expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with new Cholula taco recipe mixes and salsas is continuing to build distribution and performance to date is outperforming our expectations. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. Turning to EMEA, where we delivered a great quarter, our strongest quarterly sales performance in more than two years with double-digit sales growth. Notably, in the UK and France, we drove volume growth as pricing remained elevated. In both countries, we delivered significant growth in the discount channel, driven by expanded distribution with new and existing customers. In other parts of the region, we are also making meaningful progress in this fast-growing channel. We grew our business in the discount channel by over 30% across EMEA in the third quarter. Our grilling activations with key retailers in France and our promotional activities in the UK along with brand marketing support, drove strong third quarter growth across the growing portfolio. E-commerce also contributed meaningfully to our growth in both countries. Consumption data continues to indicate that the consumer is holding up well in our categories, with consumption trends continues to accelerate across the region. We grew share in herbs, spices and seasonings for our total EMEA business, with the UK, Eastern Europe, Italy and France all contributing. France grew share for the first time in two years. And UK recipe mixes, we extended our leading share position during the third quarter. New products and effective in-store promotions drove share gains. We also continued to drive hot sauce category growth in the UK, with Cholula leading to growth in the third quarter. And we are also building distribution of Cholula in France. In our APAC region, while the pace of recovery in this business has been slower than expected, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Notwithstanding the slower recovery in China, in all regions, in our Consumer segment, our investments in brand marketing, category management initiatives and new products are proving to be effective, and driving strong growth across our categories. We are making sequential improvement on volume, advancing our heat platform, and are pleased with our performance. We continue to fuel our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. We are also forming strategic partnerships to reach and enhance brand awareness with loyal built-in audiences. Building on the success we have with our Tabitha Brown partnership in light of new products in the U.S., where growth continues to accelerate, we are partnering with Nadiya Hussain, a celebrity British chef who won the sixth series of BBC's The Great British Bake Off in EMEA. We are launching a delicious range of short seasonings, recipe mixes, and meal kits with Nadiya and are helping build the confidence of UK consumers in the kitchen with cook-along videos and recipe ideas. We are thrilled to partner with Nadiya and preliminary results are very positive. We are looking forward to working with her on various future initiatives across the region to expand our brand awareness and accelerate new product growth. Our brand marketing efforts continue to drive awareness and strengthen our brands. As you may have seen in July, we partnered with Mars and launched a limited edition French's mustard-flavored SKITTLES. The objective of the campaign was to create top-of-mind awareness for French's through a buzzwordy moment to further strengthen the power of our brand. And of course, you can always have fun with mustard. We are thrilled that this was our most successful earned campaign to date with a record 5 billion impressions. It is also a perfect example of how we leverage our strengths across both segments, underscoring their complementary nature. Our Flavor Solutions team created the mustard flavor for this limited-edition product, which built awareness for both our consumer and foodservice businesses. Our segments are working together to further bolster French's success. I am passionate about how our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing what differentiates McCormick and enabling us to drive sustainable growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season and our related brand marketing plans across all regions. Importantly, with our supply issues resolved, we are better positioned than we were last year entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels, to one similar to pre-COVID and are supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns across all regions. We are expecting a strong holiday season. Wrapping up the Consumer update, our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved and we are using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which differentiates us even more and strengthening our leadership in our core categories. Now turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our growth momentum in this segment continues to be exceptional. The third quarter marks our 10th consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last two years. We remain committed to restoring our Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in third quarter, we again drove significant margin expansion versus prior year, and expect continued progress toward our objective to build back our margin in this segment. Let me turn to our highlights by region. Our Americas' third quarter strong sales growth was led by pricing, with an increase in volume contributing as well. Both the flavors and branded foodservice product categories grew by double digits. With flavors, our seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products. We are helping our customers grow with the strength of our brands. Our continued success with providing the seasoning for co-branded items included new ones with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's this quarter, contributed to our growth. Strength in our customers' iconic products also contributed to our seasonings' growth, particularly related to our heat platform. We also have strong momentum in flavors for performance nutrition beverages and health and market applications. Our growth is outpacing the market, fueled by the advantages of our proprietary technologies. Importantly, we are winning with new products for existing and new customers, largely across our mid-market customer base, who are category leaders in specific markets or are high-growth innovators, and whose growth is outpacing larger customers. We continue to have a robust pipeline of new products and our conversion rate is strong. We are creating preferred flavors, enabling our customers to continue to win in the marketplace. In branded foodservice, we gained share in spices and seasonings this quarter. Additionally, our recent new products, Frank's Mild sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot seasoning, are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. They have both been well received by our customers, reinforcing that the demand for heat is growing at both the mild and hot end of the spectrum. We are excited for continued growth in these items as well as the overall breadth of opportunity in heat. Moving to EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio with strong growth in both our quick-service restaurant and packaged food and beverage customers. Pricing drove the growth as some of our customers in both channels continue to experience softness in the volume within their own businesses. As we continue to prune low-margin business in our Flavor Solutions segment, while it did not impact the third quarter, I want to mention that we divested a small canning business which was part of our Giotti operations in Italy. This divestiture allows us to focus our resources on our core flavors product category and drive further growth. Mike will have more on the future impact of this divestiture on the EMEA region in a few minutes. And in APAC, while the economic recovery in China was not as strong as anticipated, China contributed to the regional pricing and volume growth. Across the region, we benefited from our QSR customers' increase in promotional activity. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary-inspired innovation, are driving outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. Our flavors product category, our 100% focus on flavor, our breadth and reach, our unrivalled consumer insights, and our proprietary technology platform gives us an advantage and positions us well to continue to win in the technically-insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, driving growth and advancing our flavor leadership. And in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, culinary partnerships, and our expertise in heat to drive continued growth. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions and effective execution of our proven strategies bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our Flavor Solutions leadership as well as margin restoration. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting 8% from pricing, partially offset with a 2% volume and mixed decline. As Brendan already mentioned, there were impacts of volume related to the slower-than-expected recovery in the China Consumer business, the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. As a result, at the total company level, excluding these items, underlying volume performance was flat for the quarter and improved sequentially from the second quarter. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased by 1%, reflecting a 5% increase in pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are: a 2% decline due to a lower-than-expected recovery in China; and a 2% decline attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture, our business exit in Russia, and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins. On Slide 14, Consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency and included a 4% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline due to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and DSD items I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales increased 10%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline primarily from exiting Russia. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all markets and categories. Constant currency Consumer sales in the APAC region decreased 11%, driven by a 15% volume decrease, primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Also contributing to the decline was the impact of lapping strong China demand in the prior year following significant extended lockdowns during the second quarter of last year. Turning to our Flavor Solution segment in Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 11%, reflecting a 10% increase from pricing and a 1% increase from volume and product mix. Our volume growth was partially offset by the pruning of low-margin business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 10%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing and a 1% volume and product mix growth. Growth was broad based across the portfolio, with strengths and flavors, including seasonings and specialty flavors, as well as branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% impact from exiting the private label product line mentioned earlier. Outside of this product discontinuation, volumes declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses. Regarding the divestiture of the Giotti canning business Brendan mentioned earlier, we expect this divestiture to impact EMEA Flavor Solutions by approximately 3% starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. For the total Flavor Solutions segment, we expect an approximately 1% impact, and for the total company, less than 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 13% in constant currency with a 7% contribution from pricing and 6% volume growth, driven by our customers' promotional activities and limited time offers across the region. As seen on Slide 21, gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points in the third quarter versus the year-ago period, reflecting our steadfast focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs, and the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the past two years. We expect to finish 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter. Historically, our third quarter gross margin has been higher than the second quarter. This year, however, they were comparable at approximately 37% because we realized our highest level of both pricing and cost recovery from prior years in the second quarter. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year. And as evident by our full year outlook and year-to-date results, we expect a higher gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year as well as expansion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now moving to Slide 22, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the third quarter of last year, as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the third quarter of last year and we continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing for the full year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment, which was impacted by the slower China recovery and brand marketing investments, declined 5%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income increased 42%. Turning to interest expense and the income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the third quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4%, compared to 21.2% in the year-ago period. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with the McCormick-branded mayonnaise, marmalades, and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 as compared to $0.69 for the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by lapping a favorable impact primarily related to an optimization of our debt portfolio included in other income in the third quarter of last year. This impact is also a headwind to our full year results. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was very strong, $660 million in 2023 compared to $250 million for the same period last year, a 164% increase. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $314 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $187 million of cash for capital expenditures through the third quarter. We expect 2023 to be a very strong year of cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 year-to-date cash flow from operations of $660 million, which is already slightly higher than our full year cash flow in 2022. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends, and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With our improving gross margin and lower inventory, we are well positioned to continue paying down debt, and we now expect to de-lever to approximately 3 times earlier in 2024 than we originally expected. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top-line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth. Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also anticipate minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact year-to-date through the third quarter and project a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our sales and operating profit outlook for 2023 despite a slower recovery in China. We no longer expect a 1% contribution to our sales from lapping last year's COVID disruptions in China. And we're also revising the benefit from a China recovery to our operating income from 300 basis points to 100 basis points. At the top-line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, and anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range given the lower-than-expected China recovery. The wrap of last year's pricing actions as well as the impact of new ones in 2023 are the primary drivers of growth. Several factors are expected to impact our volume and product mix for the year, including: price elasticities, which are consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment; the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter; the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio; we continue to estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA's Flavor Solutions private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter of 2023; and finally, the divestiture of Giotti's canning business, which closed on the first day of the fourth quarter, will have a minimal impact on total company sales for the year. We continue to plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 110 basis points to 140 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low- to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. It also reflects more than offsetting cost pressures with pricing actions, as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 10% to 12% constant currency growth. There are some discrete items expected to impact our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, remaining consistent with our prior outlook, we expect our GOE program to have an 800 basis point favorable impact and the Kitchen Basics divestiture to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. Next, I already mentioned the expected 100 basis point benefit related to China, which is lower than the originally anticipated 300 basis points. Finally, we expect a 900 basis point unfavorable impact from building back incentive compensation, slightly ahead of our prior projection of 800 basis points, given the increase in earnings expectations since the beginning of the year. The net impact of these discrete items is an unfavorable 100 basis points as compared to a 200 basis point favorable impact in our previous outlook. The reaffirmation of our adjusted operating income outlook despite the unfavorable change in the impact from discrete items highlight stronger than originally expected profit realization on our underlying business, which is now expected to be 11% to 13% growth compared to 8% to 10% growth previously. We are reaffirming our low single-digit increases in brand marketing investments, our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million, our interest expense outlook of an estimated range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, and our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22%. We are increasing our income from unconsolidated operations projection to a 30% expected increase from 2022, reflecting the strong performance we expect in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 14% to 16%, above our prior projection of 10% to 12%. Combining this 14% to 16% underlying growth with a 1% unfavorable impact from the discrete items on adjusted operating profit and the combined interest and tax headwind of 9% results in an expected increase of 4% to 6% or a projected guidance range of adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.62 to $2.67. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top-line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth, as well as margin expansion and strong cash flow. We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 financial outlook.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, trusted brands, increased digital engagement, and purpose-minded practices continue to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are end-to-end flavor for our consumers and customers. We remain a different kind of CPG company, one differentiated by our growth platform, the results that we have achieved over the last years and our culture. We play in great and fast growing categories. Our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing our differentiation. The scale, insights, and technology that we leverage from both segments are meaningful in driving sustainable growth. We continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to drive success. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide as their energy and excitement for the business is coming through in our results. Now to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 30. Our third quarter performance was strong, reflecting sustained demand and the effective execution of our growth strategies. And our volume performance, excluding China, continued to improve. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our year-to-date cash flow from operation results was strong, already equal to our full year 2022 results. Our reaffirmed sales and operating profit guidance, despite lower-than-expected China recovery, highlights the growing strength of the rest of the business. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and execution of our proven strategies bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory over the long term. Now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. I guess maybe to start off with McCormick obviously as you mentioned saw some sequential volume improvement in Consumer Americas in the fiscal third quarter and you're lapping an easier -- and even easier I guess down 11% volume decline in the year-ago period in the fourth quarter. So, I guess my question is would you expect volume in the Consumer Americas segment to flip positively in the fourth quarter? And if not, I guess, what would be the key factors that would keep you from doing so, obviously all in the context of an industry volume backdrop that remains kind of subdued?\nBrendan Foley: Well, thanks Andrew for your question. Just to maybe speak first to last year's fourth quarter. I think our sales growth back in 2022 was down about 1.7%, I think, on sales. And that was up without Kitchen Basics. And we were lapping the 2021 retail inventory build in a high level. I think we, as we talked about on that call, entered the 2022 holiday with just a lot stronger inventory than we were counting on or predicting or forecasting. So, the way we're looking at it is the net sales impact really was up about -- a little over 4% in the fourth quarter last year. So, we're not seeing that necessarily as an easy comparison overall, but just talking to dollars first, that's kind of our view is just we're still looking at a pretty robust fourth quarter from a year ago just knowing that we had that comparison in the fourth quarter. Now, when we look at this year's fourth quarter, as we said on the call here earlier, you will see the impact of that DSD continuation in our Hispanic bagged spices part of our business. It just tends to be -- that business tends to be heavier in the fourth quarter because of the holidays, so that will be a little bit stronger then. But to our spices and seasonings business, we continue to see improving trends in that part of our portfolio. And you should expect to see that in the fourth quarter, that sequential improvement in performance overall. And we feel like we're going to have a strong holiday. I mean, I think the reasons why we feel good about the direction of that part of our portfolio is, and you heard it on the call, we're gaining share and we're gaining distribution on Super Deal, Herbs & Spices. On the Lowry's opening price point platform, we're still getting really good performance for that, but still also building out distribution. And we have one value retailer that we've only begun just starting shipments on, and they'll start to build out and fill out more store locations because we have like just in that one particular account, 85% of the locations still yet to come. So, we still see distribution build happening behind Lowry's overall. And that renovation that we launched here this year, we talked about in the second quarter, is doing really well where we see it getting on shelf. Now we shipped about 40%, but what's appearing on shelf is probably just a little bit different because we don't really have that data. But what we're seeing with when we see that new package come on shelf is that [Indiscernible] improves quite a bit. So, we're really encouraged by our performance there. And we're definitely seeing strong consumer reaction to the new package. And so that will obviously continue to build in the four quarter. And we're also turning on our media right now, advertising the benefits of the package. But then we're also having holiday campaigns starting to run too. So, we feel like there's a lot of good momentum in the pipeline. Obviously, a lot of that will carry into 2024, but we still feel really good about the strength of that part of our business going into the fourth quarter. What's also helping us though is that our core categories are performing a little bit stronger than overall total edible in the grocery store. So, we see continued strength there just from a category standpoint. We have good performance across other core categories like recipe mix, condiments, and sauces. So, we expect pretty good performance there. But there are some categories where we participate along with our food peers, it's probably at a much smaller scale. But these are categories like frozen or the Asian category where we see more volume decline like we've seen in the rest of center of store in that part of our business. That's just one part of it. The portfolio I just gave you some color on that we're seeing definitely the type of softness that you're seeing in other categories. But the fundamental trends have not shifted. Despite this recovery in China being a lot slower, U.S. and Europe are performing as expected. And as you heard in the call, we kind of reaffirmed our guidance on sales despite China, which is meant to indicate that we still see a strength in the performance of our business overall.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks. I'll pass it on and leave it there. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask about the market share trends that we're seeing in Americas Consumer? It's obviously been under pressure for some time because of the distribution losses and so on. But I'm wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when either the comparables get easier or innovation helps to turn it around. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. And then, I have a follow-up.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks, Alexia. Yeah, I think as we take a look at our performance overall in terms of shares, et cetera, just talking maybe specifically to spices and seasonings, the dollars are a bit tricky because we are seeing private label and our competitors take more price right now in the last couple of months to catch up to the pricing that we've taken in the marketplace. But this is helpful obviously because it starts to close price gaps. And so, I think you're seeing some stronger dollar performance there. But from a unit standpoint, we believe we're performing even better. That lag is even less. And so, as we then look to the pipeline of activities that we have going on, much like I just mentioned on the previous question, whether it's parts of our product line that are really starting to build momentum or distribution that builds momentum, we see a strong pipeline across that part of our portfolio as well as just stronger overall marketing initiatives now that we have really a shared supply across all of our portfolio. So, when we talk about light at the end of the tunnel, we just see sequential improvement over the course of time as we fall back on distribution points, which we've grown this quarter, as well as just the pipeline of activity and renovation that we have across our portfolio. You're seeing a good view of that right now, but there's more to come. And so, we do feel pretty confident about our ability to continue driving sequential improvement, whether it's in spices and seasonings or across other categories.\nMike Smith: I think, too, we think some of the same things we've done in Europe, for example, where we had, as we mentioned today, a really good share performance and volume performance in markets like UK and France, which are similar to the U.S. So those types of activities we are doing, whether it's innovation, upgrading, renovating the line, have had success over there too.\nAlexia Howard: Great, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. You talked about the free cash flow allowing you to de-lever more quickly than expected. What's your level of appetite for acquisitions next year? And where are the priorities? Is it Consumer? Is it Flavor Solutions? Domestic? International? Just wondering how you're thinking about the pipeline on the M&A side. And I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nMike Smith: Alexia, as you said, we're having really good success on our operating cash flow. We're really excited about that. As we said on the call today, we're going to de-lever faster than we thought to get back to our 3 times target. We're always looking at acquisitions. I mean, we have a corporate development team that is always working internally to look at those assets. We have an appetite as part of our long-term growth algorithm. A third of our 4% to 6% long-term growth algorithm is M&A. However, we're still in the process of paying down debt. I think the fourth quarter is our biggest cash flow quarter generally. As we get into next year though, as we get closer to our targets, I think as assets come up that are attractive, whether they're Consumer or Flavor Solutions, U.S., International, we really look for things that don't dilute our sales growth. Our top-line is really important to us. You look at the past with Cholula and FONA and RB, those are the type of assets we really like. Would we like it to be a bit more international? Yes. Flavor Solutions now also is an area where we really like that and look at FONA and Giotti as past acquisitions we're really happy with. So, sorry for the long-winded answer, but I think we're getting back to where we want to be to enter back in the M&A market. And as long as it meets those strategies in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions for attractive assets, we'll be buyers hopefully at the right price.\nBrendan Foley: But right now, paying down our debt is our priority.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. A number of your broader U.S. packaged food peers have been talking about value seeking behavior, whether it's moving down to cheaper brands and private label, or channel shifting, or simply buying less units of food. You mentioned some comments earlier about the movement to larger package sizes that you're seeing, but I'm curious if you can talk more broadly about how value seeking behavior is impacting your business, particularly given you're also a large producer of private label spices and seasonings. Thanks very much.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks for the question. We're seeing value play out through many different types of actions from the consumer. Some are going to larger sizes and we see that quite a bit and as an example of where we're taking an opportunity to continue growing even more quickly. In that part of our portfolio, we're definitely seeing sustainable continued trends towards larger sizes. And what's also interesting about larger sizes, at least in the categories that we have, especially spices and seasonings, is that the purchase rate is still just as fast as it was with a smaller size. So, people are going through when they have it in the household, they're going through a little bit just as fast or more quickly. But the other way value kind of presents itself too is opportunities like this opening price point. With the pricing that's happened in the market, as we talked about before, it created a price pocket that we feel like we needed to fill with a brand like Lowry's. And so that's playing a role in our portfolio that's offering a brand to consumers. And a lot of consumers still prefer brands. And it's allowing them to move towards a brand that's a lower opening price point and fills the need. And we're seeing a lot of success with that too. But the other way we're really talking a lot about value is directly to the consumer, especially if you think about a lot of our communication right now over the past year has been value oriented. And we're talking about the role that our portfolio plays in terms of providing flavor for pennies of serving. And that is really having a positive impact. Plus, a lot of our content is also focusing on how consumers continue to save money by creating, let's say, for example, just larger batch sizes of food so they can have leftovers for a couple nights in a row, or tricks and hacks like that that allow consumers to create even more value and stretch the food dollar even further. That's where we see our category really playing a role in the household, especially during this kind of -- where there's a lot of consumer concern around inflation, our categories are playing a helpful role in that. So, we're looking at it from a number of different angles, but I just illustrated three right there that we are hitting pretty hard during this period of time.\nMax Gumport: Thanks. Very helpful. I'll pass that along.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. I guess maybe trying to take Andrew's question in maybe a slightly different kind of light. Brendan, is there any way to help frame the distribution kind of gains that you're seeing and expect to see over the incoming quarters? Any way to quantify kind of how we should think about total distribution growth and where that will peak from a TDP perspective into 2024? It's harder to fully see that expansion in the scanner data. And so, I'm wondering if part of it is growth in certain unmeasured channels or value retailers that aren't captured in Nielsen.\nBrendan Foley: Well, Adam, just a few things around TDPs. I'm not going to be talking about what to expect in 2024, just -- because we'll talk about that guidance as we look at early next year, but just talking a little bit more about TDP performance. It remains an important area of focus for us, and we've been taking a lot of action to restore distribution, which has really lost the supply over the last one or two years. I think it's an important reminder that about half of those TDP losses are a result of just proactive discontinuations that we made. And those are not likely to be restored. But we are starting to see TDP growth, something which we said would start to come this year in the third quarter. And we believe that performance has improved versus like the previous two quarters of the year. And I would also just share with you that our assortment on shelf now is even more productive than it was versus pre-COVID. So that velocity, those turns that we get on shelf from that assortment there is actually even more productive not only for McCormick, but also for the retailer. So that's something really important to pass along. And we'll start to see more distribution come online as retailers reset their shelves. We're seeing a bit of that happen right now as we speak going into the fourth quarter, but we expect to see even more of that as we go into 2024. So that's one, I think, context around, TDPs and distribution that we think provides context and color. We will continue to accelerate innovation, and that's something that we did in 2023. We'll continue to do that in future fiscal years. That will also build on sort of the TDP momentum and distribution growth that we see. I think those are some of the points that I think that are without calling out a specific TDP number and gain to expect. We continue to see continued improvement, sequential improvement as we look at this over time. And as we mentioned in previous calls, it will take a little bit of time to get it back, but we are still making forward progress on this.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just ask a separate question on the Flavor Solutions segment. And as you think about some of the different customer types that you have and geographies, how would you frame kind of recent inbound kind of bid activity in RFPs and contract win rates? Are you seeing your customers accelerate their innovation agenda to drive growth in their business? Or is activity levels slowing down? Just any color -- as you think about that pipeline of new business wins, kind of how would you frame that?\nBrendan Foley: I'd point to our performance in the Americas as an example as to how to think about our current momentum on our flavor business. We had really good sales growth, but we also had some volume growth. And that's an example of what we're seeing not only through our flavors business but also branded foodservice. And we are starting to -- we are growing share in a number of the strong categories that we participate in. We talked about performance nutrition or the health end market. We see it happening there, or even in alcoholic beverages. We have been seeing some nice growth and gains in that part of our business. Is there anything particularly unique at this point in the year versus what it was like earlier in the year? No, I don't think I can point to anything that's terribly unique that we haven't already talked about before, but this has been an element of sort of continued sequential improvement of performance. We've been able to grow a little bit of volume here probably because of the strength of our products and technology that go into the categories we play in. And so that's I think some of the context there. We're happy to be growing share. We believe that we have the right plans. Now if you look at elsewhere within Flavor Solutions, our EMEA business tends to be more heavily weighted towards the QSR part of our customer base. They're not seeing the type of traffic and promotions that they have in, let's say, the prior year. So, we still see a little bit of pressure on overall volumes there. Conversely, in Asia Pacific, our QSR business there is actually doing quite well. Customers are turning back on promotions. They are trying to drive more traffic in their stores. And so, we, as a result, are also seeing some nice volume growth in that part of our portfolio at Flavor Solutions. But dialing back to sort of that flavor part of our category, we are pleased with the performance that we have made so far this year. And it's continued momentum, but nothing that there is a certain new inflection point to share with you.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Pleased proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Hey, great, and good morning. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Steve.\nMike Smith: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Powers: Hey. So, I wanted to ask on the incremental gross margin improvement that you see in your outlook this quarter, building on a raise that happened last quarter as well. And just, if you could put a little bit of context and detail around exactly what's driving that incremental gross margin upside? Question number one. Then, question number two is, as we've seen that gross margin tick up over the balance of the year, we haven't seen you change your reinvestment strategy in terms of brand marketing. I just want a little bit of color and context as to why that isn't a source of reinvestment as you do realize that gross margin upside.\nMike Smith: Well, thanks, Steve. This is Mike. I'll take that one. I'm surprised it took five questions to get to gross margin, so thanks for asking that question. First of all, we're really pleased with the gross margin performance this year. We've had improvement. We had a strong third quarter. You think about the things we're doing with the cost recovery through our pricing, which we've really been successful at this year. The GOE and CCI commitments we put out at the beginning of the year, we're really happy with our performance there across those segments, that's the other thing. These margin improvements are happening both in the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side, which is really -- which is great. As far as raising for the year, as you know, we've had good performance year-to-date. And even with some of the challenges in China, our strong underlying performance has really held through. So, as to why we wouldn't raise really the A&P spent, I mean, we feel really comfortable where we are from A&P with our current guide. The third quarter was up 8% and it was the highest dollar amount we've ever spent in the third quarter. So, we feel we're very effective there. Actually, CPI is a topic, we get savings across all costs of goods sold, but we get it on SG&A too. And A&P is an area where the teams have gotten real cost savings or efficiencies in our advertising program. So, it's even higher than you see from a dollar perspective. So, I think we're confident where we are in gross margin. We're building back. If you go back to pre-'19 -- pre-COVID in 2019, our gross margins were around 40%. Using our implied guidance this year, gets you around 37%. The interesting thing is if you look at the map on the pricing dilution that has happened, it's been -- it's over 500 basis point headwind to us, which you can see, we're down 300 basis points. So during that time, through CCI and other things, we've captured some of that back, which we continue to see in the future as we get back to those pre-COVID gross margin and operating profit levels.\nBrendan Foley: Now, Steve, if I could, there was a question in there about A&P too, and just to really kind of build on that. In that, we were up significantly in the third quarter [indiscernible] at 8%, but it was probably our highest historical spend, right? So, we're really putting a lot more in the A&P as we sort of called out, and we'll have a strong level again in the fourth quarter, and these are going into a lot of important campaigns right now. So, I just wanted to reinforce, I think we are seeing still an increase in spend in that part of our -- in that line of the P&L.\nSteve Powers: Okay. That's great. And so, I guess -- that's helpful. Thank you. And Mike, so just playing back the various puts and takes on gross margin, is it fair to say that the biggest sort of upside surprise for you over the course of the year has just -- has been successful price realization, or are there elements of business mix or other drivers there? Because it feels like the productivity has come in solidly, but roughly in line with, I think, original expectations. Cost inflation hasn't changed materially, so it seems like the buckets has to be pricier, or...\nMike Smith: The way I say it, Steve, everything is going to move in the right direction. We were successful getting our cost recovery. We got some pricing earlier as you probably inferred from some of our pricing numbers. So, we got our pricing faster than last year, which was helpful. The GOE and CCI programs, like I said, have met targets. And frankly, we're a bit prudent this year. I think as we said -- as we gave guidance in January after last year, we wanted to make sure we hit our numbers. There was a lot of big assumptions going in into 2023, pricing, GOE program, things like that, and we knew the China -- we were counting on a China recovery which impacts not only gross margin but operating profit. So, we felt at this time after Q3, where we see us spending for the year, we felt it'd be a good line of sight to the commodity cost, things like that too, which gave us the comfort to get there. The other thing, too, is, as you think of it, when Brandon was talking a little bit about the strong -- our underlying performance in things like spices and seasonings, when you look at our performance in other markets, we've had really good portfolio -- really good portfolio mix, and some of the things we're doing on portfolio optimization with pruning low-margin business does help grow these margins also, and will help us as we go into the future.\nSteve Powers: Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt Smith: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMatt Smith: If I could follow up on the margin commentary and the headwind from pricing dilution, as we look at the Flavor Solutions business, you've been making margin recovery progress there. But can you talk about the factors that are keeping the current margin 400 basis points or so below historical levels? And how much of that is the mechanical pricing impact versus other factors? And then, what supports the margin recovery from here?\nMike Smith: Yeah, it's a great question, Matt. If you think about it, pre-COVID, we were at 14.5% operating profit, which at the time we were really happy with because we came from a low of around 6% several years before. But we also did acknowledge that as we migrated our portfolio, we had higher aspirations to get higher than that as we migrated to more flavor type products. COVID has been -- and the cost related to that have really been a big challenge to us and a headwind, and also the huge cost increases that have hit Flavor Solutions. So last year, we were at 8%, as you know. This year, we're looking to build back. Year-to-date, we're around 10%. So probably around that for the end of the year. So, 200 basis point improvement this year. Back to your question on dilution, at the operating profit level, we've had about a 300 basis point dilution impact on Flavor Solutions. So theoretically, if that didn't happen, I know it did happen, but that 10% would become 13%. So, we're about 150 basis points short of that pre-COVID-19 margin improvement. And things like we've done with GOE, which we see continuing and wrapping into next year; the dual running costs, we're having it primarily in our Flavor Solutions business in the UK manufacturing facility, that goes away partially next year and the year after it's totally gone, which is great; continued TCI. So, these types of things will get us back to -- and portfolio migration, pruning the low-margin business, we talked about some of the private label foodservice business in the EMEA this call. Those types of things were focused really, really well on getting our margins up. And some of the things when Brandon talks about performance nutrition and beverage, those are the flavor type of items. They're growing faster. We really like those. They can help margin up our whole Flavor Solutions portfolio.\nBrendan Foley: But we do like the progress we're making independent of price and dilution, just on overall improvement in the margin there. So, we do believe we're moving in the right direction.\nMatt Smith: Okay, thank you for that. I can pass it on.\nMike Smith: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question.\nMike Smith: Hey, Rob.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning. Rob.\nRobert Moskow: Good morning. I wanted to know about the guide -- the implied guide for organic sales growth in fourth quarter. It looks like it's about 3% and that marks a substantial deceleration from the first three quarters. And then even when we try to look at that on a four-year basis, just using like 2019 as the base, it's again, a big decline. We're all looking at the U.S. retail data in Nielsen and IRI, it's all decelerating. Are you taking that into account in your guide? And if so, it sounds a little like a disconnect from the expectations for a very strong holiday season.\nMike Smith: Hey, Rob, just to clarify, you just mentioned the word -- number 3%. Our implied guide is in the midpoint is 3.7% to 11.2%, which implies 7.5%.\nRobert Moskow: I'm just trying to get to your -- I'm just trying to plug in a fourth quarter organic sales number to get to your midpoint of 5% to 7%, 6% for the year.\nBrendan Foley: Yeah, I think -- Rob, it's Brendan. The things to keep in mind, I think for the fourth quarter, it's our largest quarter. So, we're not able to provide a precise estimate, but I think some broad concepts to consider is we do expect some growth in China in Consumer in the fourth quarter. If you recall, we're lapping over a pretty severe lockdown at that time, this time a year ago overall. We still expect to have a reasonable impact from the DSD discontinuation in the Americas, heavier because it's during the holiday season. We still expect some softness in Flavor Solutions demand that will persist, that will certainly be there, but we will also lap the impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as the Consumer business exit in Russia. So those are just some considerations I think when we take a look at fourth quarter sales.\nMike Smith: Yeah, I think, Rob, just a follow up on my point before, from a reported basis, our implied fourth quarter guidance is 3.7% at the low end to 11.2%. That includes about a 2% FX favorable, because FX is back-loaded favorable this year. So, constant currency is 5% to 5.5% range. So, I'm not sure where the 3% is coming from for the fourth quarter you mentioned. Make it as a follow-up with Faten and Kasey, we can make sure your model is okay.\nRobert Moskow: That's fine. So, maybe that answers the question, Mike. So, you're not expecting any kind of decel in U.S. retail conditions in fourth quarter?\nBrendan Foley: No, in fact -- yeah. We do believe we're having again underlying improvement. We've mentioned this the last few quarters and we continue to progress there.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nMike Smith: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thank you so much. I just wanted to ask a question about the renovated SKUs. I think I heard you say in the prepared remarks that -- I think it's 40% of the renovated SKUs, maybe our own shelf. So, maybe just as a reminder, just curious kind of when you think about total SKU selection, it sounds like maybe it's more spice and seasoning, kind of what percent is being renovated? And then kind of what's the feedback so far as to why that's driving velocity? Is it just consumers are more attracted to different packaging or -- it doesn't sound like these are different SKUs. Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks for the question. Just to make sure I clarify what we said in the prepared remarks, about 40% of those SKUs are shipping and the SKUs we're talking about is part of our core herbs and spices line. These tend to be those straight fill items, meaning it's a bottle of cumin or a bottle of cinnamon, et cetera, so that's what we're calling those straight fill spices. And we have visibility to the SKUs that are being shipped. It's not as easy to track exactly what has hit shelf yet. And that's really dependent on the retailers' plans. But where we know it has, there's really been an improvement in velocity overall. And one of the drivers of that, just there's a lot of different benefits from this new package. We've talked about it before, but it is nitrogen-flushed, so there's even -- what we're providing there is just greater long-term freshness. Until you open up that package, we're really securing the freshness of that product. There's sort of a nice click and snap with the cap that really kind of tells the consumer, not only just through seeing but also listening, there's a real sort of snap to disclosure that kind of again creates to retain freshness. And the package is 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, so it also has a big sustainability benefit. It just has a great appearance on the shelf overall. And so, we knew that this was a strong packaging innovation because we've launched it in other markets around the world like in EMEA. And also, it's also going out to the Asia Pacific too. So, we have some experience with this package and how it performs. And we're seeing similar, if not better, velocity performance as we get started here on U.S. shelves. So that's a little bit of context around what we're seeing from that renovation in our product line.\nMike Smith: Yeah, just to re-emphasize that 40% is really shipped. I mean, if you walk into a store today, it might be 10% of the items or 5% or 20% depending on the stores, but it depends sometimes on their supply chain, too. So, we see like a good tailwind into next year from this too.\nRob Dickerson: Got it, Okay. Super. Thanks. And then maybe just quickly and kind of simplistically on SG&A. Q3 you ran for total SG&A about 22% of revenues. Clearly, that's up, but kind of inline-ish, right, relative to maybe the kind of prior four or five years. As we think about Q4 and then I guess kind of going forward, is like 22% of sales, is that kind of fair? Or could there be certain quarter-to-quarter movement? Thanks.\nMike Smith: Yeah, I mean third quarter I think was a bit of a high watermark for SG&A. We had a big incentive comp. As we talked about on the call, incentive comp got billed back for a couple reasons. And remember last year's third quarter was way down. So, the incentive comp was getting adjusted then. So, the build back this year was a big part of SG&A on a smaller quarter than the fourth quarter. So, you got to think about it in makable terms too. And really then incentive comp was driven, not only by the EPS improvement, with everyone in the company, which is great. Within our regions, the mix of our regional underlying strength of Americas and EMEA region did drive it a bit more NIV -- excuse me, incentive comp, but also the great working capital performance. And people forget that sometimes, I mean we're an EVA, economic value-added company. We have a working capital charge component of our incentive compensation. So, last year when working capital wasn't great, we all got dinged for it. This year, we are doing great and coming through incentive comp. It is just another reason we are driving cash and those types of activities that help us lever down and things like that, which are really great. So, a bit more of that impact in the third quarter. And then, brand marketing, we mentioned up 8%. So really strong performance there. And for the year, we stick to our guide as low-single digit A&P.\nRob Dickerson: And maybe if I could just sneak one last one in. Asia-Pac, clearly understand what you're talking about in terms of just getting a slower China recovery. And I think you called out maybe a few kind of one-off drivers, but maybe it's more EMEA-driven. Kind of net-net, right, Asia-Pac in Consumer, it was still down a quarter, but clearly Asia-Pac in Flavor Solutions is doing better, and I realize, like, part of your China business is in Consumer, but maybe it's still somewhat foodservice. So, I'm just trying to understand kind of the comparison between kind of Asia-Pac Consumer versus Asia-Pac Flavor Solutions, and what's driving the delta? That's all. Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Well, appreciate the question there, Rob, on China. It's probably worth unpacking that a little bit. I would say, though, despite the pace of recovery in this business having been slower than expected, we continue to believe in long-term growth trajectory of that business. And it's also when you step back on a constant currency basis, we are growing this business. Versus a year ago, we've grown sales in the high-single digits. So, yeah, we're disappointed that the pace of recovery wasn't what we expected it to be, but nevertheless, we are growing sales year-over-year. And even despite the volatility since 2019, we've grown our total China business at a 3% CAGR on a constant currency basis, which is kind of in line with the long-term algorithm. So, this is really an element of an economy that certainly is recovering more slowly than what we would have expected. And where we see that now, this kind of goes into sort of how we're thinking about Flavor Solutions versus Consumer. And part of that Consumer business is in the foodservice channel, but people are just simply not necessarily going out to a lot of the catering and outside dining events that we've seen in the past, and that's just been a slower recovery overall. We're also seeing that also happening in retail. Consumer spending is just soft right now overall in China, and we're seeing that play out. Where we start to see -- and this is actually more of a change in this quarter, just more of the typical promotional activity or limited time offers that we tend to see in the QSR segment have begun to come back a little bit more. So that gives us some reason to believe that this is just a slower recovery than what we planned, but the fundamentals that drive that business are still there and it's just going to take a little bit more time to get back to what we expect from this part of our business.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Super. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Faten Freiha for closing remarks.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. And that concludes this morning's conference call. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to join you today for my first earnings call as President and CEO. Just over one month into my new role, I am energized by our underlying business trends, which reinforce our competitive advantages and differentiation. Let's turn to our results. We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Our results were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding challenges for our Consumer segment in Asia Pacific, or APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery been slower than previously anticipated. Let me start with the highlights for the third quarter. We delivered solid constant currency sales growth. We continued to realize effective price realization, and importantly, volume performance, excluding China, has improved each quarter throughout the year. We continued to see top-line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Year-to-date cash flow from operations more than doubled relative to the prior year due to higher operating income and working capital improvements. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our business fundamentals and the effective execution of our proven strategies while leveraging the sustained demand for flavor. Turning to Slide 5. In the third quarter, we drove 6% sales growth in constant currency, demonstrating the strength of our broad global portfolio. Our constant currency growth reflected strong business performance, with an 8% contribution from pricing and a 2% decline in volume and product mix. This decline in volume was driven by two factors: a 1% volume decline attributable to the impact of a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China; and a 1% decline related to the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and the pruning of low-margin business to optimize our portfolio. All other underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 1%. I would like to now share a few highlights on gross margin and operating income for the quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail. We drove strong gross margin improvement year-over-year, reflecting continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged last year, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. We remain focused on improving our margins over the long term and believe that our recovery will be a continuous build. And we expect to return to historical levels and believe there is a runway beyond that, recognizing it will take some time. Higher gross profit for the quarter was partially offset by lower-than-expected performance in China as well as higher SG&A. As planned, we continue to build back incentive compensation and increased brand marketing investments. The net impact was a 5% increase in adjusted operating income versus the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results year-to-date. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our focused approach to optimizing our cost structure, reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory during the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving into the fourth quarter, we can continue to expect top-line momentum across our portfolio, including growth in China, as we lap the COVID-related disruptions. China's growth, however, is expected to be less than originally anticipated, which, when combined with its year-to-date performance, has led to a lower full year 2023 benefit than we originally expected. Despite this impact, however, we are reaffirming our sales outlook and now anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range. We are reaffirming our operating income outlook, which highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our business, excluding China. Demand is strong. We are driving improvement in our margin profile and are optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now for our performance by segment. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 7. We saw solid results across the Americas and EMEA, which were tempered by our APAC region due to China, as I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding China, we are pleased with our underlying performance. Now for some highlights by regions. First, in the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew approximately 4%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of DSD, Direct-Store-Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices. There is a minor difference between our sales and consumption, which is attributable to listing fees for a significant increase in new distribution and new products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions. Importantly, our categories remain advantaged in terms of growth relative to overall macro trends, and we are well positioned to drive future growth. The fundamental strength of the spices and seasonings category is evident as cooking at home has remained elevated since pre-COVID and consumers have an increasing demand for flavor. U.S. spices and seasonings growth is continuing to outpace the total edible category in units and dollars. We have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions to grow market share in this very attractive and competitive category. We have made progress and shown improvement relative to the beginning of the year. We continue to restore distribution, which was lost because of supply issues. As we look at our performance and our trends, we are happy to see total distribution point growth in the third quarter. We also continue to be pleased that our assortment on shelf is more productive than pre-COVID. In addition, we have significant new distribution and innovation that is starting to come online as customers reset their shelves. As we've said before, restoration will take some time and we expect to drive growth as we continue to progress. In addition to driving distribution gains, we have a continued focus on supporting our brands and optimizing pricing. As you would expect, this has become a more important part of our category management efforts in recent years. Our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns, as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. Our efforts are yielding results. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday spice and herb portfolio is rolling out according to plan. At the end of the third quarter, we have shipped about 40% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have transitioned on shelf have seen high-teens improvement in velocity. And our significant brand marketing campaign featuring the benefits of the new packaging ramped up at the end of the third quarter leading into the holiday season. Our larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continues to gain share. We saw strong performance in the third quarter, driven by pricing and higher unit volume. Expanded distribution has been a major driver for our performance, as well as consumers that are seeking value and trading up to larger sizes. We have the right assortment in this environment. Our household penetration on larger sizes is greater than pre-COVID. We are confident this product line will continue to drive growth as we expand distribution further and launch new line extensions. Our grilling performance was strong this quarter, supported by our Fire Up campaign as well as contribution for new product launches that we discussed on our earnings call in June. Frank's RedHot sauces, French's mustard and Stubb's Bar-B-Q sauces and rubs, as well as Lawry's marinades, all delivered significant growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year. We drove double-digit sales growth with contributions from pricing and volume across our total grilling portfolio. And we drove market share gains in mustard, barbecue sauce and marinades in the third quarter. Our expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with new Cholula taco recipe mixes and salsas is continuing to build distribution and performance to date is outperforming our expectations. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. Turning to EMEA, where we delivered a great quarter, our strongest quarterly sales performance in more than two years with double-digit sales growth. Notably, in the UK and France, we drove volume growth as pricing remained elevated. In both countries, we delivered significant growth in the discount channel, driven by expanded distribution with new and existing customers. In other parts of the region, we are also making meaningful progress in this fast-growing channel. We grew our business in the discount channel by over 30% across EMEA in the third quarter. Our grilling activations with key retailers in France and our promotional activities in the UK along with brand marketing support, drove strong third quarter growth across the growing portfolio. E-commerce also contributed meaningfully to our growth in both countries. Consumption data continues to indicate that the consumer is holding up well in our categories, with consumption trends continues to accelerate across the region. We grew share in herbs, spices and seasonings for our total EMEA business, with the UK, Eastern Europe, Italy and France all contributing. France grew share for the first time in two years. And UK recipe mixes, we extended our leading share position during the third quarter. New products and effective in-store promotions drove share gains. We also continued to drive hot sauce category growth in the UK, with Cholula leading to growth in the third quarter. And we are also building distribution of Cholula in France. In our APAC region, while the pace of recovery in this business has been slower than expected, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Notwithstanding the slower recovery in China, in all regions, in our Consumer segment, our investments in brand marketing, category management initiatives and new products are proving to be effective, and driving strong growth across our categories. We are making sequential improvement on volume, advancing our heat platform, and are pleased with our performance. We continue to fuel our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. We are also forming strategic partnerships to reach and enhance brand awareness with loyal built-in audiences. Building on the success we have with our Tabitha Brown partnership in light of new products in the U.S., where growth continues to accelerate, we are partnering with Nadiya Hussain, a celebrity British chef who won the sixth series of BBC's The Great British Bake Off in EMEA. We are launching a delicious range of short seasonings, recipe mixes, and meal kits with Nadiya and are helping build the confidence of UK consumers in the kitchen with cook-along videos and recipe ideas. We are thrilled to partner with Nadiya and preliminary results are very positive. We are looking forward to working with her on various future initiatives across the region to expand our brand awareness and accelerate new product growth. Our brand marketing efforts continue to drive awareness and strengthen our brands. As you may have seen in July, we partnered with Mars and launched a limited edition French's mustard-flavored SKITTLES. The objective of the campaign was to create top-of-mind awareness for French's through a buzzwordy moment to further strengthen the power of our brand. And of course, you can always have fun with mustard. We are thrilled that this was our most successful earned campaign to date with a record 5 billion impressions. It is also a perfect example of how we leverage our strengths across both segments, underscoring their complementary nature. Our Flavor Solutions team created the mustard flavor for this limited-edition product, which built awareness for both our consumer and foodservice businesses. Our segments are working together to further bolster French's success. I am passionate about how our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing what differentiates McCormick and enabling us to drive sustainable growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season and our related brand marketing plans across all regions. Importantly, with our supply issues resolved, we are better positioned than we were last year entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels, to one similar to pre-COVID and are supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns across all regions. We are expecting a strong holiday season. Wrapping up the Consumer update, our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved and we are using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which differentiates us even more and strengthening our leadership in our core categories. Now turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our growth momentum in this segment continues to be exceptional. The third quarter marks our 10th consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last two years. We remain committed to restoring our Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in third quarter, we again drove significant margin expansion versus prior year, and expect continued progress toward our objective to build back our margin in this segment. Let me turn to our highlights by region. Our Americas' third quarter strong sales growth was led by pricing, with an increase in volume contributing as well. Both the flavors and branded foodservice product categories grew by double digits. With flavors, our seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products. We are helping our customers grow with the strength of our brands. Our continued success with providing the seasoning for co-branded items included new ones with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's this quarter, contributed to our growth. Strength in our customers' iconic products also contributed to our seasonings' growth, particularly related to our heat platform. We also have strong momentum in flavors for performance nutrition beverages and health and market applications. Our growth is outpacing the market, fueled by the advantages of our proprietary technologies. Importantly, we are winning with new products for existing and new customers, largely across our mid-market customer base, who are category leaders in specific markets or are high-growth innovators, and whose growth is outpacing larger customers. We continue to have a robust pipeline of new products and our conversion rate is strong. We are creating preferred flavors, enabling our customers to continue to win in the marketplace. In branded foodservice, we gained share in spices and seasonings this quarter. Additionally, our recent new products, Frank's Mild sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot seasoning, are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. They have both been well received by our customers, reinforcing that the demand for heat is growing at both the mild and hot end of the spectrum. We are excited for continued growth in these items as well as the overall breadth of opportunity in heat. Moving to EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio with strong growth in both our quick-service restaurant and packaged food and beverage customers. Pricing drove the growth as some of our customers in both channels continue to experience softness in the volume within their own businesses. As we continue to prune low-margin business in our Flavor Solutions segment, while it did not impact the third quarter, I want to mention that we divested a small canning business which was part of our Giotti operations in Italy. This divestiture allows us to focus our resources on our core flavors product category and drive further growth. Mike will have more on the future impact of this divestiture on the EMEA region in a few minutes. And in APAC, while the economic recovery in China was not as strong as anticipated, China contributed to the regional pricing and volume growth. Across the region, we benefited from our QSR customers' increase in promotional activity. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary-inspired innovation, are driving outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. Our flavors product category, our 100% focus on flavor, our breadth and reach, our unrivalled consumer insights, and our proprietary technology platform gives us an advantage and positions us well to continue to win in the technically-insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, driving growth and advancing our flavor leadership. And in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, culinary partnerships, and our expertise in heat to drive continued growth. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions and effective execution of our proven strategies bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our Flavor Solutions leadership as well as margin restoration. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance. Thank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, trusted brands, increased digital engagement, and purpose-minded practices continue to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are end-to-end flavor for our consumers and customers. We remain a different kind of CPG company, one differentiated by our growth platform, the results that we have achieved over the last years and our culture. We play in great and fast growing categories. Our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing our differentiation. The scale, insights, and technology that we leverage from both segments are meaningful in driving sustainable growth. We continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to drive success. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide as their energy and excitement for the business is coming through in our results. Now to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 30. Our third quarter performance was strong, reflecting sustained demand and the effective execution of our growth strategies. And our volume performance, excluding China, continued to improve. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our year-to-date cash flow from operation results was strong, already equal to our full year 2022 results. Our reaffirmed sales and operating profit guidance, despite lower-than-expected China recovery, highlights the growing strength of the rest of the business. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and execution of our proven strategies bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory over the long term. Now for your questions. Good morning, Andrew. Well, thanks Andrew for your question. Just to maybe speak first to last year's fourth quarter. I think our sales growth back in 2022 was down about 1.7%, I think, on sales. And that was up without Kitchen Basics. And we were lapping the 2021 retail inventory build in a high level. I think we, as we talked about on that call, entered the 2022 holiday with just a lot stronger inventory than we were counting on or predicting or forecasting. So, the way we're looking at it is the net sales impact really was up about -- a little over 4% in the fourth quarter last year. So, we're not seeing that necessarily as an easy comparison overall, but just talking to dollars first, that's kind of our view is just we're still looking at a pretty robust fourth quarter from a year ago just knowing that we had that comparison in the fourth quarter. Now, when we look at this year's fourth quarter, as we said on the call here earlier, you will see the impact of that DSD continuation in our Hispanic bagged spices part of our business. It just tends to be -- that business tends to be heavier in the fourth quarter because of the holidays, so that will be a little bit stronger then. But to our spices and seasonings business, we continue to see improving trends in that part of our portfolio. And you should expect to see that in the fourth quarter, that sequential improvement in performance overall. And we feel like we're going to have a strong holiday. I mean, I think the reasons why we feel good about the direction of that part of our portfolio is, and you heard it on the call, we're gaining share and we're gaining distribution on Super Deal, Herbs & Spices. On the Lowry's opening price point platform, we're still getting really good performance for that, but still also building out distribution. And we have one value retailer that we've only begun just starting shipments on, and they'll start to build out and fill out more store locations because we have like just in that one particular account, 85% of the locations still yet to come. So, we still see distribution build happening behind Lowry's overall. And that renovation that we launched here this year, we talked about in the second quarter, is doing really well where we see it getting on shelf. Now we shipped about 40%, but what's appearing on shelf is probably just a little bit different because we don't really have that data. But what we're seeing with when we see that new package come on shelf is that [Indiscernible] improves quite a bit. So, we're really encouraged by our performance there. And we're definitely seeing strong consumer reaction to the new package. And so that will obviously continue to build in the four quarter. And we're also turning on our media right now, advertising the benefits of the package. But then we're also having holiday campaigns starting to run too. So, we feel like there's a lot of good momentum in the pipeline. Obviously, a lot of that will carry into 2024, but we still feel really good about the strength of that part of our business going into the fourth quarter. What's also helping us though is that our core categories are performing a little bit stronger than overall total edible in the grocery store. So, we see continued strength there just from a category standpoint. We have good performance across other core categories like recipe mix, condiments, and sauces. So, we expect pretty good performance there. But there are some categories where we participate along with our food peers, it's probably at a much smaller scale. But these are categories like frozen or the Asian category where we see more volume decline like we've seen in the rest of center of store in that part of our business. That's just one part of it. The portfolio I just gave you some color on that we're seeing definitely the type of softness that you're seeing in other categories. But the fundamental trends have not shifted. Despite this recovery in China being a lot slower, U.S. and Europe are performing as expected. And as you heard in the call, we kind of reaffirmed our guidance on sales despite China, which is meant to indicate that we still see a strength in the performance of our business overall. Good morning. Thanks, Alexia. Yeah, I think as we take a look at our performance overall in terms of shares, et cetera, just talking maybe specifically to spices and seasonings, the dollars are a bit tricky because we are seeing private label and our competitors take more price right now in the last couple of months to catch up to the pricing that we've taken in the marketplace. But this is helpful obviously because it starts to close price gaps. And so, I think you're seeing some stronger dollar performance there. But from a unit standpoint, we believe we're performing even better. That lag is even less. And so, as we then look to the pipeline of activities that we have going on, much like I just mentioned on the previous question, whether it's parts of our product line that are really starting to build momentum or distribution that builds momentum, we see a strong pipeline across that part of our portfolio as well as just stronger overall marketing initiatives now that we have really a shared supply across all of our portfolio. So, when we talk about light at the end of the tunnel, we just see sequential improvement over the course of time as we fall back on distribution points, which we've grown this quarter, as well as just the pipeline of activity and renovation that we have across our portfolio. You're seeing a good view of that right now, but there's more to come. And so, we do feel pretty confident about our ability to continue driving sequential improvement, whether it's in spices and seasonings or across other categories. But right now, paying down our debt is our priority. Thanks for the question. We're seeing value play out through many different types of actions from the consumer. Some are going to larger sizes and we see that quite a bit and as an example of where we're taking an opportunity to continue growing even more quickly. In that part of our portfolio, we're definitely seeing sustainable continued trends towards larger sizes. And what's also interesting about larger sizes, at least in the categories that we have, especially spices and seasonings, is that the purchase rate is still just as fast as it was with a smaller size. So, people are going through when they have it in the household, they're going through a little bit just as fast or more quickly. But the other way value kind of presents itself too is opportunities like this opening price point. With the pricing that's happened in the market, as we talked about before, it created a price pocket that we feel like we needed to fill with a brand like Lowry's. And so that's playing a role in our portfolio that's offering a brand to consumers. And a lot of consumers still prefer brands. And it's allowing them to move towards a brand that's a lower opening price point and fills the need. And we're seeing a lot of success with that too. But the other way we're really talking a lot about value is directly to the consumer, especially if you think about a lot of our communication right now over the past year has been value oriented. And we're talking about the role that our portfolio plays in terms of providing flavor for pennies of serving. And that is really having a positive impact. Plus, a lot of our content is also focusing on how consumers continue to save money by creating, let's say, for example, just larger batch sizes of food so they can have leftovers for a couple nights in a row, or tricks and hacks like that that allow consumers to create even more value and stretch the food dollar even further. That's where we see our category really playing a role in the household, especially during this kind of -- where there's a lot of consumer concern around inflation, our categories are playing a helpful role in that. So, we're looking at it from a number of different angles, but I just illustrated three right there that we are hitting pretty hard during this period of time. Good morning. Well, Adam, just a few things around TDPs. I'm not going to be talking about what to expect in 2024, just -- because we'll talk about that guidance as we look at early next year, but just talking a little bit more about TDP performance. It remains an important area of focus for us, and we've been taking a lot of action to restore distribution, which has really lost the supply over the last one or two years. I think it's an important reminder that about half of those TDP losses are a result of just proactive discontinuations that we made. And those are not likely to be restored. But we are starting to see TDP growth, something which we said would start to come this year in the third quarter. And we believe that performance has improved versus like the previous two quarters of the year. And I would also just share with you that our assortment on shelf now is even more productive than it was versus pre-COVID. So that velocity, those turns that we get on shelf from that assortment there is actually even more productive not only for McCormick, but also for the retailer. So that's something really important to pass along. And we'll start to see more distribution come online as retailers reset their shelves. We're seeing a bit of that happen right now as we speak going into the fourth quarter, but we expect to see even more of that as we go into 2024. So that's one, I think, context around, TDPs and distribution that we think provides context and color. We will continue to accelerate innovation, and that's something that we did in 2023. We'll continue to do that in future fiscal years. That will also build on sort of the TDP momentum and distribution growth that we see. I think those are some of the points that I think that are without calling out a specific TDP number and gain to expect. We continue to see continued improvement, sequential improvement as we look at this over time. And as we mentioned in previous calls, it will take a little bit of time to get it back, but we are still making forward progress on this. I'd point to our performance in the Americas as an example as to how to think about our current momentum on our flavor business. We had really good sales growth, but we also had some volume growth. And that's an example of what we're seeing not only through our flavors business but also branded foodservice. And we are starting to -- we are growing share in a number of the strong categories that we participate in. We talked about performance nutrition or the health end market. We see it happening there, or even in alcoholic beverages. We have been seeing some nice growth and gains in that part of our business. Is there anything particularly unique at this point in the year versus what it was like earlier in the year? No, I don't think I can point to anything that's terribly unique that we haven't already talked about before, but this has been an element of sort of continued sequential improvement of performance. We've been able to grow a little bit of volume here probably because of the strength of our products and technology that go into the categories we play in. And so that's I think some of the context there. We're happy to be growing share. We believe that we have the right plans. Now if you look at elsewhere within Flavor Solutions, our EMEA business tends to be more heavily weighted towards the QSR part of our customer base. They're not seeing the type of traffic and promotions that they have in, let's say, the prior year. So, we still see a little bit of pressure on overall volumes there. Conversely, in Asia Pacific, our QSR business there is actually doing quite well. Customers are turning back on promotions. They are trying to drive more traffic in their stores. And so, we, as a result, are also seeing some nice volume growth in that part of our portfolio at Flavor Solutions. But dialing back to sort of that flavor part of our category, we are pleased with the performance that we have made so far this year. And it's continued momentum, but nothing that there is a certain new inflection point to share with you. Good morning, Steve. Now, Steve, if I could, there was a question in there about A&P too, and just to really kind of build on that. In that, we were up significantly in the third quarter [indiscernible] at 8%, but it was probably our highest historical spend, right? So, we're really putting a lot more in the A&P as we sort of called out, and we'll have a strong level again in the fourth quarter, and these are going into a lot of important campaigns right now. So, I just wanted to reinforce, I think we are seeing still an increase in spend in that part of our -- in that line of the P&L. Good morning. But we do like the progress we're making independent of price and dilution, just on overall improvement in the margin there. So, we do believe we're moving in the right direction. Good morning. Rob. Yeah, I think -- Rob, it's Brendan. The things to keep in mind, I think for the fourth quarter, it's our largest quarter. So, we're not able to provide a precise estimate, but I think some broad concepts to consider is we do expect some growth in China in Consumer in the fourth quarter. If you recall, we're lapping over a pretty severe lockdown at that time, this time a year ago overall. We still expect to have a reasonable impact from the DSD discontinuation in the Americas, heavier because it's during the holiday season. We still expect some softness in Flavor Solutions demand that will persist, that will certainly be there, but we will also lap the impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as the Consumer business exit in Russia. So those are just some considerations I think when we take a look at fourth quarter sales. No, in fact -- yeah. We do believe we're having again underlying improvement. We've mentioned this the last few quarters and we continue to progress there. Thanks for the question. Just to make sure I clarify what we said in the prepared remarks, about 40% of those SKUs are shipping and the SKUs we're talking about is part of our core herbs and spices line. These tend to be those straight fill items, meaning it's a bottle of cumin or a bottle of cinnamon, et cetera, so that's what we're calling those straight fill spices. And we have visibility to the SKUs that are being shipped. It's not as easy to track exactly what has hit shelf yet. And that's really dependent on the retailers' plans. But where we know it has, there's really been an improvement in velocity overall. And one of the drivers of that, just there's a lot of different benefits from this new package. We've talked about it before, but it is nitrogen-flushed, so there's even -- what we're providing there is just greater long-term freshness. Until you open up that package, we're really securing the freshness of that product. There's sort of a nice click and snap with the cap that really kind of tells the consumer, not only just through seeing but also listening, there's a real sort of snap to disclosure that kind of again creates to retain freshness. And the package is 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, so it also has a big sustainability benefit. It just has a great appearance on the shelf overall. And so, we knew that this was a strong packaging innovation because we've launched it in other markets around the world like in EMEA. And also, it's also going out to the Asia Pacific too. So, we have some experience with this package and how it performs. And we're seeing similar, if not better, velocity performance as we get started here on U.S. shelves. So that's a little bit of context around what we're seeing from that renovation in our product line. Well, appreciate the question there, Rob, on China. It's probably worth unpacking that a little bit. I would say, though, despite the pace of recovery in this business having been slower than expected, we continue to believe in long-term growth trajectory of that business. And it's also when you step back on a constant currency basis, we are growing this business. Versus a year ago, we've grown sales in the high-single digits. So, yeah, we're disappointed that the pace of recovery wasn't what we expected it to be, but nevertheless, we are growing sales year-over-year. And even despite the volatility since 2019, we've grown our total China business at a 3% CAGR on a constant currency basis, which is kind of in line with the long-term algorithm. So, this is really an element of an economy that certainly is recovering more slowly than what we would have expected. And where we see that now, this kind of goes into sort of how we're thinking about Flavor Solutions versus Consumer. And part of that Consumer business is in the foodservice channel, but people are just simply not necessarily going out to a lot of the catering and outside dining events that we've seen in the past, and that's just been a slower recovery overall. We're also seeing that also happening in retail. Consumer spending is just soft right now overall in China, and we're seeing that play out. Where we start to see -- and this is actually more of a change in this quarter, just more of the typical promotional activity or limited time offers that we tend to see in the QSR segment have begun to come back a little bit more. So that gives us some reason to believe that this is just a slower recovery than what we planned, but the fundamentals that drive that business are still there and it's just going to take a little bit more time to get back to what we expect from this part of our business."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting 8% from pricing, partially offset with a 2% volume and mixed decline. As Brendan already mentioned, there were impacts of volume related to the slower-than-expected recovery in the China Consumer business, the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. As a result, at the total company level, excluding these items, underlying volume performance was flat for the quarter and improved sequentially from the second quarter. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased by 1%, reflecting a 5% increase in pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are: a 2% decline due to a lower-than-expected recovery in China; and a 2% decline attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture, our business exit in Russia, and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins. On Slide 14, Consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency and included a 4% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline due to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and DSD items I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales increased 10%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline primarily from exiting Russia. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all markets and categories. Constant currency Consumer sales in the APAC region decreased 11%, driven by a 15% volume decrease, primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Also contributing to the decline was the impact of lapping strong China demand in the prior year following significant extended lockdowns during the second quarter of last year. Turning to our Flavor Solution segment in Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 11%, reflecting a 10% increase from pricing and a 1% increase from volume and product mix. Our volume growth was partially offset by the pruning of low-margin business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 10%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing and a 1% volume and product mix growth. Growth was broad based across the portfolio, with strengths and flavors, including seasonings and specialty flavors, as well as branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% impact from exiting the private label product line mentioned earlier. Outside of this product discontinuation, volumes declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses. Regarding the divestiture of the Giotti canning business Brendan mentioned earlier, we expect this divestiture to impact EMEA Flavor Solutions by approximately 3% starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. For the total Flavor Solutions segment, we expect an approximately 1% impact, and for the total company, less than 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 13% in constant currency with a 7% contribution from pricing and 6% volume growth, driven by our customers' promotional activities and limited time offers across the region. As seen on Slide 21, gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points in the third quarter versus the year-ago period, reflecting our steadfast focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs, and the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the past two years. We expect to finish 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter. Historically, our third quarter gross margin has been higher than the second quarter. This year, however, they were comparable at approximately 37% because we realized our highest level of both pricing and cost recovery from prior years in the second quarter. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year. And as evident by our full year outlook and year-to-date results, we expect a higher gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year as well as expansion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now moving to Slide 22, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the third quarter of last year, as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the third quarter of last year and we continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing for the full year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment, which was impacted by the slower China recovery and brand marketing investments, declined 5%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income increased 42%. Turning to interest expense and the income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the third quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4%, compared to 21.2% in the year-ago period. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with the McCormick-branded mayonnaise, marmalades, and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 as compared to $0.69 for the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by lapping a favorable impact primarily related to an optimization of our debt portfolio included in other income in the third quarter of last year. This impact is also a headwind to our full year results. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was very strong, $660 million in 2023 compared to $250 million for the same period last year, a 164% increase. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $314 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $187 million of cash for capital expenditures through the third quarter. We expect 2023 to be a very strong year of cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 year-to-date cash flow from operations of $660 million, which is already slightly higher than our full year cash flow in 2022. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends, and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With our improving gross margin and lower inventory, we are well positioned to continue paying down debt, and we now expect to de-lever to approximately 3 times earlier in 2024 than we originally expected. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top-line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth. Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also anticipate minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact year-to-date through the third quarter and project a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our sales and operating profit outlook for 2023 despite a slower recovery in China. We no longer expect a 1% contribution to our sales from lapping last year's COVID disruptions in China. And we're also revising the benefit from a China recovery to our operating income from 300 basis points to 100 basis points. At the top-line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, and anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range given the lower-than-expected China recovery. The wrap of last year's pricing actions as well as the impact of new ones in 2023 are the primary drivers of growth. Several factors are expected to impact our volume and product mix for the year, including: price elasticities, which are consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment; the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter; the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio; we continue to estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA's Flavor Solutions private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter of 2023; and finally, the divestiture of Giotti's canning business, which closed on the first day of the fourth quarter, will have a minimal impact on total company sales for the year. We continue to plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 110 basis points to 140 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low- to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. It also reflects more than offsetting cost pressures with pricing actions, as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 10% to 12% constant currency growth. There are some discrete items expected to impact our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, remaining consistent with our prior outlook, we expect our GOE program to have an 800 basis point favorable impact and the Kitchen Basics divestiture to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. Next, I already mentioned the expected 100 basis point benefit related to China, which is lower than the originally anticipated 300 basis points. Finally, we expect a 900 basis point unfavorable impact from building back incentive compensation, slightly ahead of our prior projection of 800 basis points, given the increase in earnings expectations since the beginning of the year. The net impact of these discrete items is an unfavorable 100 basis points as compared to a 200 basis point favorable impact in our previous outlook. The reaffirmation of our adjusted operating income outlook despite the unfavorable change in the impact from discrete items highlight stronger than originally expected profit realization on our underlying business, which is now expected to be 11% to 13% growth compared to 8% to 10% growth previously. We are reaffirming our low single-digit increases in brand marketing investments, our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million, our interest expense outlook of an estimated range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, and our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22%. We are increasing our income from unconsolidated operations projection to a 30% expected increase from 2022, reflecting the strong performance we expect in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 14% to 16%, above our prior projection of 10% to 12%. Combining this 14% to 16% underlying growth with a 1% unfavorable impact from the discrete items on adjusted operating profit and the combined interest and tax headwind of 9% results in an expected increase of 4% to 6% or a projected guidance range of adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.62 to $2.67. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top-line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth, as well as margin expansion and strong cash flow. We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 financial outlook. Good morning. I think, too, we think some of the same things we've done in Europe, for example, where we had, as we mentioned today, a really good share performance and volume performance in markets like UK and France, which are similar to the U.S. So those types of activities we are doing, whether it's innovation, upgrading, renovating the line, have had success over there too. Alexia, as you said, we're having really good success on our operating cash flow. We're really excited about that. As we said on the call today, we're going to de-lever faster than we thought to get back to our 3 times target. We're always looking at acquisitions. I mean, we have a corporate development team that is always working internally to look at those assets. We have an appetite as part of our long-term growth algorithm. A third of our 4% to 6% long-term growth algorithm is M&A. However, we're still in the process of paying down debt. I think the fourth quarter is our biggest cash flow quarter generally. As we get into next year though, as we get closer to our targets, I think as assets come up that are attractive, whether they're Consumer or Flavor Solutions, U.S., International, we really look for things that don't dilute our sales growth. Our top-line is really important to us. You look at the past with Cholula and FONA and RB, those are the type of assets we really like. Would we like it to be a bit more international? Yes. Flavor Solutions now also is an area where we really like that and look at FONA and Giotti as past acquisitions we're really happy with. So, sorry for the long-winded answer, but I think we're getting back to where we want to be to enter back in the M&A market. And as long as it meets those strategies in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions for attractive assets, we'll be buyers hopefully at the right price. Good morning. Hi, Steve. Well, thanks, Steve. This is Mike. I'll take that one. I'm surprised it took five questions to get to gross margin, so thanks for asking that question. First of all, we're really pleased with the gross margin performance this year. We've had improvement. We had a strong third quarter. You think about the things we're doing with the cost recovery through our pricing, which we've really been successful at this year. The GOE and CCI commitments we put out at the beginning of the year, we're really happy with our performance there across those segments, that's the other thing. These margin improvements are happening both in the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side, which is really -- which is great. As far as raising for the year, as you know, we've had good performance year-to-date. And even with some of the challenges in China, our strong underlying performance has really held through. So, as to why we wouldn't raise really the A&P spent, I mean, we feel really comfortable where we are from A&P with our current guide. The third quarter was up 8% and it was the highest dollar amount we've ever spent in the third quarter. So, we feel we're very effective there. Actually, CPI is a topic, we get savings across all costs of goods sold, but we get it on SG&A too. And A&P is an area where the teams have gotten real cost savings or efficiencies in our advertising program. So, it's even higher than you see from a dollar perspective. So, I think we're confident where we are in gross margin. We're building back. If you go back to pre-'19 -- pre-COVID in 2019, our gross margins were around 40%. Using our implied guidance this year, gets you around 37%. The interesting thing is if you look at the map on the pricing dilution that has happened, it's been -- it's over 500 basis point headwind to us, which you can see, we're down 300 basis points. So during that time, through CCI and other things, we've captured some of that back, which we continue to see in the future as we get back to those pre-COVID gross margin and operating profit levels. The way I say it, Steve, everything is going to move in the right direction. We were successful getting our cost recovery. We got some pricing earlier as you probably inferred from some of our pricing numbers. So, we got our pricing faster than last year, which was helpful. The GOE and CCI programs, like I said, have met targets. And frankly, we're a bit prudent this year. I think as we said -- as we gave guidance in January after last year, we wanted to make sure we hit our numbers. There was a lot of big assumptions going in into 2023, pricing, GOE program, things like that, and we knew the China -- we were counting on a China recovery which impacts not only gross margin but operating profit. So, we felt at this time after Q3, where we see us spending for the year, we felt it'd be a good line of sight to the commodity cost, things like that too, which gave us the comfort to get there. The other thing, too, is, as you think of it, when Brandon was talking a little bit about the strong -- our underlying performance in things like spices and seasonings, when you look at our performance in other markets, we've had really good portfolio -- really good portfolio mix, and some of the things we're doing on portfolio optimization with pruning low-margin business does help grow these margins also, and will help us as we go into the future. Yeah, it's a great question, Matt. If you think about it, pre-COVID, we were at 14.5% operating profit, which at the time we were really happy with because we came from a low of around 6% several years before. But we also did acknowledge that as we migrated our portfolio, we had higher aspirations to get higher than that as we migrated to more flavor type products. COVID has been -- and the cost related to that have really been a big challenge to us and a headwind, and also the huge cost increases that have hit Flavor Solutions. So last year, we were at 8%, as you know. This year, we're looking to build back. Year-to-date, we're around 10%. So probably around that for the end of the year. So, 200 basis point improvement this year. Back to your question on dilution, at the operating profit level, we've had about a 300 basis point dilution impact on Flavor Solutions. So theoretically, if that didn't happen, I know it did happen, but that 10% would become 13%. So, we're about 150 basis points short of that pre-COVID-19 margin improvement. And things like we've done with GOE, which we see continuing and wrapping into next year; the dual running costs, we're having it primarily in our Flavor Solutions business in the UK manufacturing facility, that goes away partially next year and the year after it's totally gone, which is great; continued TCI. So, these types of things will get us back to -- and portfolio migration, pruning the low-margin business, we talked about some of the private label foodservice business in the EMEA this call. Those types of things were focused really, really well on getting our margins up. And some of the things when Brandon talks about performance nutrition and beverage, those are the flavor type of items. They're growing faster. We really like those. They can help margin up our whole Flavor Solutions portfolio. Okay. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Rob. Hey, Rob, just to clarify, you just mentioned the word -- number 3%. Our implied guide is in the midpoint is 3.7% to 11.2%, which implies 7.5%. Yeah, I think, Rob, just a follow up on my point before, from a reported basis, our implied fourth quarter guidance is 3.7% at the low end to 11.2%. That includes about a 2% FX favorable, because FX is back-loaded favorable this year. So, constant currency is 5% to 5.5% range. So, I'm not sure where the 3% is coming from for the fourth quarter you mentioned. Make it as a follow-up with Faten and Kasey, we can make sure your model is okay. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, just to re-emphasize that 40% is really shipped. I mean, if you walk into a store today, it might be 10% of the items or 5% or 20% depending on the stores, but it depends sometimes on their supply chain, too. So, we see like a good tailwind into next year from this too. Yeah, I mean third quarter I think was a bit of a high watermark for SG&A. We had a big incentive comp. As we talked about on the call, incentive comp got billed back for a couple reasons. And remember last year's third quarter was way down. So, the incentive comp was getting adjusted then. So, the build back this year was a big part of SG&A on a smaller quarter than the fourth quarter. So, you got to think about it in makable terms too. And really then incentive comp was driven, not only by the EPS improvement, with everyone in the company, which is great. Within our regions, the mix of our regional underlying strength of Americas and EMEA region did drive it a bit more NIV -- excuse me, incentive comp, but also the great working capital performance. And people forget that sometimes, I mean we're an EVA, economic value-added company. We have a working capital charge component of our incentive compensation. So, last year when working capital wasn't great, we all got dinged for it. This year, we are doing great and coming through incentive comp. It is just another reason we are driving cash and those types of activities that help us lever down and things like that, which are really great. So, a bit more of that impact in the third quarter. And then, brand marketing, we mentioned up 8%. So really strong performance there. And for the year, we stick to our guide as low-single digit A&P."

To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President, and COO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President, and CFO. I would also like to welcome [Indiscernible] joining us on this call this morning. [Indiscernible] joined McCormick earlier this month as Vice President, Investor Relations. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of these non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on slide two for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. To start, last night, we announced that Brendan Foley will become McCormick\u2019s next Chief Executive Officer on September 1, and he is joining the Board of Directors immediately. I could not be more pleased with Brendan as my successor. I will continue to serve McCormick and all of its stakeholders as Executive Chairman of the Board once Brendan becomes CEO. This is a transition that we have been planning internally as part of an orderly multi-year succession plan, and it's exciting to finally share the news with all of you. As many of you know, Brendan is exceptionally well qualified and prepared to lead McCormick. He deeply understands the importance of delivering continued strong growth, while doing the right things for people, communities, and the planet. With our advantaged competitive positioning, supported by the growing demand for flavor and with our tremendous depth of talent, I have utmost confidence that McCormick, under Brendan's leadership, will continue to drive differentiated growth and long-term shareholder value. Congratulations, Brendan. Now on to our earnings update. First, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan will provide the business segment update, Mike will provide details on our financial results and 2023 outlook, and after your questions, I will have some final comments. Starting with our second quarter results. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance, which reflects sustained demand across our business and effective execution of our strategy. We delivered double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our pricing actions are in place and, importantly, our volume performance improved. We continue to see top line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth. Additionally, we drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our global operating effectiveness or GOE program, which includes the optimization of our supply chain cost structure, is yielding results. We grew adjusted earnings per share of 25% driven by significant adjusted operating income growth, and despite interest rate and tax headwinds. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations more than doubled driven by higher earnings, I just mentioned and working capital improvements. Notably, we're reducing inventory levels as planned. Both segments in all regions contributed with strong growth. Our results benefited from our recovery in China. And while the timing and pace of recovery in our China business was less robust than anticipated, it was still strong, and we are confident in the contribution China will provide to our results as the year progresses. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results during the first half of 2023. Our year-to-date results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our growth trajectory as we enter the second-half of the year. As such, we are raising our adjusted operating income and earnings per share outlook for the full-year. Turning to slide five. In the second quarter, we drove 8% sales growth or 10% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong business performance, with an 11% contribution from pricing and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Netted in this volume decline are net 1% volume increase from China recovery, partially offset by our Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and 1% decline attributable to pruning low-margin business. As examples, we exited direct store delivery, DSD, of our bagged Hispanic products in our Americas consumer segment and a private label food service line in EMEA. From a segment lens, both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments delivered strong sales growth in each region. In the Consumer segment, we continue to have strong price realization and we drove a sequential improvement in volume performance. Flavor Solutions, our exceptional performance continued with our ninth consecutive quarter of constant currency double-digit sales growth. Our sales performance demonstrates the strength of our broad global portfolio and positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. I'd like to share a few highlights about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in a few moments. We drove significant gross margin improvement, reflecting the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged last year. Cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs and the impact of strategic decisions we've made to optimize our portfolio, with a focus on driving margin improvement as we continue to prune low-margin business. Our gross margin expansion in the quarter was partially offset by higher SG&A as we build back incentive compensation as planned. Our adjusted operating income increased by 35% versus the second quarter of last year or, in constant currency, 36%. This growth drove an adjusted earnings per share increase of 25%, which also reflected higher interest and effective tax rate. We remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. We are halfway through the year. Our year-to-date results speak for themselves. We expect to continue driving profitable growth for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvements in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide for their collective power is driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job that McCormick team has done navigating the dynamic environment over the last few years. I'd like to recognize their energy and excitement for the business, which is coming through in our results. Now I'd like to ask Brendan to share the second quarter business updates for our segments.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Lawrence. Starting with our Consumer segment, on slide eight. Our underlying performance was strong reflecting our price realization and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trends. We continue to see sequential improvement. Now for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 7%. The difference between our sales and consumption was attributable to the retail sell-through of discontinued items and listing fees for an increase in the new distribution and products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubs items and Tabitha brown line expansions. As anticipated, our alignment between consumption and shipments is normalizing. As usual, we expect some business fluctuations from period-to-period. In spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters with unit strength in core products such as straight fill spices and vanilla, as well as our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration. Lunch-to-date results of our Lawry's everyday spice range continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profits of the category, and like the first quarter, over half of the purchases are from new buyers to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. We also continue to see consumers trade up from private label. As our proprietary research indicates, consumers still preferred brands, even when under economic pressure. Our excitement and distribution for this product line continues to build. The renovation of our U.S. core Everyday Spice in their portfolio is rolling out according to plan and is a seamless transition for our retail partners as it fits into existing shelf spots. At the end of the second quarter we had about 30% of our SKUs on shelf, we will continue to rollout the product over the course of the year and our significant brand marketing campaign will be ramping up at the end of the third quarter. Our larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continue to benefit the category and McCormick with 11% consumption growth in the second quarter as consumers continue to put more at home. Super Deal's purchase cycle is similar to that of smaller sizes even though they are 3 times the volume. And household penetration remains greater than pre-COVID. We kicked off the grilling season at the end of the second quarter and early results are good. Frank\u2019s RedHot and Cholula Hot Sauces, French's mustard, Lawry's Marinade\u2019s, and McCormick mayonaisa, all delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. With Stubs barbecue sauce, as well as Grill Mate's seasoning blends and recipe mixes, following close with high-single-digit growth. We are expecting our new grilling products and strong promotions to heat up share performance. We've launched three new Grill Mates on-trend flavors, including Smash Burger and Garlic Butter, as well as Griller's Choice Marinades, which you can use as three different flavors, all have had strong retailer acceptance. We are really excited about our Stubs Real Smoke Rubs, which capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor and Stubb Jalapeno and Honey Barbecue Sauce, which combines two trending flavor profiles and the nuance of heat and flavor that are Frank's Smoke and Sweet Barbecue Wing sauce offers. We are fired up for the grilling season and expect the launch of our fire up brand marketing campaign in the third quarter to fire up consumer demand as well. Our expansion into the fast growing Mexican aisle with Cholula Taco recipe mixes and salsas based on authentic Mexican formulas is off to a great start following our Cinco de Mayo execution. During the third quarter, we are increasing our Cholula brand marketing investments to support our expanded portfolio. Our third quarter brand marketing will also include increasing our investments for our McCormick Gourmet product line with our further for flavor campaign, highlighting our commitment to sustainability from farm to table. With our supply issues of this product line resolved, we are excited to be able to support this premium product offering for the first time in two years. And importantly, as we enter the second-half of the year, it is historically our most significant period. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers, and growing with new products, such as our new Frank Dill Pickle hot sauce on our direct-to-consumer platform, which sold out in less than a week. We will start to expand distribution in stores late this year. In EMEA, our second quarter was strongest quarterly sales performance in two years, our effective pricing accelerated to contribute double-digit growth and our volume performance improved sequentially. And in fact, we grew volume in the U.K. and Eastern Europe. Consumption data continues to indicate the consumer is holding up well in our categories and our share performance is solid. We are growing herbs, spices and seasonings share in Eastern Europe and in Italy, and our growth plans in France are also yielding results with improved share performance. We are excited about celebrating the 60th anniversary of our [Indiscernible] brand this year. We are scaling up our grilling activation in France, and partnering with key retailers to celebrate the brand's anniversary and to spark another reason to celebrate around the grill. In the U.K., we have also kicked off the grilling season and are building out our support and the discount channel featuring our Schwartz Grill Mates products. In both France and the U.K., we will be increasing our third quarter brand marketing investments to support grilling, as well as new products and to continue to emphasize our value messaging. Across the region, we are making meaningful progress in the fast growing discount channel, expanding distribution, and gaining share. Finally, we are gaining share of the U.K. hot sauce category. We continue to drive strong Frank's RedHot performance and are accelerating our Cholula growth. With new distribution and e-commerce multi-packs, contributing significantly to our hot sauce growth. Overall, our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proven to be effective and are driving growth in EMEA. In the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter reflected lapping the COVID related disruptions in China. While our business is recovering and our second quarter growth was robust, it was lower than our expectations as the pace of reopening is proving to be more gradual and consumer spending was pressured by broad-based economic pressures in region. We remain optimistic for a more normal operating environment emerging as the year progresses and we enter into 2024, driving sustainable growth as we executed on our strategies. Outside of China, new products and brand marketing initiatives drove double-digit growth in other markets with strength and branded spices and seasonings and Frank's RedHot. Wrapping up to consumer update, we are fueling our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved, and we're using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. Our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past, before, during and after the pandemic. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories, and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our leadership in core categories. Now turning to flavor solutions on slide 10. We are continuing our outstanding sales growth momentum in this segment. As Lawrence already mentioned, second quarter was our ninth consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. We have previously shared our commitment to restoring profitability in this segment, and the second quarter is marketing an inflection point toward our objective to continuing to build our margin. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions, we are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lag the last two years. Recovery in the second quarter was even greater than the first. Now for regional highlights. Our Americas second quarter strong sales growth was led by our flavors product category. Within flavors, seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products, which is outpacing last year's new product contribution, as well as our strength in our customers' iconic products. We are winning in seasonings with our heat platform, flavors for performance nutrition beverages, and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new products for existing and new customers. In branded food service, we continue to gain share in hot sauce, mustard, spices, and seasonings, with strength this quarter in Grill Mates and Lawry's. Our grilling portfolio is firing up in branded food service just like in our consumer segment. Moving to EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the second quarter. Overall, our price realization accelerated again from last quarter. Notably, we grew sales constant currency 15% in the quarter despite an impact from pruning low margin business as Lawrence mentioned earlier, and softness in some of our QSR impacted food and beverage customers' volume within their own business. And in APZ, we also experienced recovery in China and are encouraged about the return to normal as growth was also driven by strong performance of our quick service restaurant customers' promotions. Outside of China, we delivered double-digit growth with effective price realization, as well as solid volume growth driven by demand from QSRs. The strength of our flavor solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary inspired innovation are driving our outstanding flavor solutions momentum. The power of McCormick and FONA together continues to create exciting growth opportunities in the technically insulated and value-added part of our portfolio especially with our recent wins in Healthy Nutrition. And in branded food service, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, and culinary partnerships to drive continued growth. Our robust plans of flavor solutions bolster our confidence and continuing our growth trajectory and driving our flavor solutions leadership. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 12, our top line constant currency sales grew 10%, compared to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 11% from pricing, partially offset with a 1% volume and mix decline. As Lawrence already mentioned, there were impacts to volume related to the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of our consumer business in Russia, and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. At the total company level, all these impacts netted out. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased 7%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline. Including in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and our business exit in Russia, a 1% decline from exiting DSD or Direct Store Delivery business for our Hispanic bag products in the Americas. On slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, with an 8% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 2% volume decline from the Hispanic product DSD exit and 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Our strong underlying sales growth was driven by the products in our grilling portfolio, Brendan mentioned earlier. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9% with a 12% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline from exiting Russia and a 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all categories and markets. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 28% driven by a 20% volume increase from China recovery and a 6% increase from pricing actions across the entire region, as well as 2% increase in all other volume and product mix. Turning to our flavor solutions segment on slide 16, we grew second quarter constant currency sales 13%, reflecting a 14% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China offset by a 1% decline from discontinuing a private label food service product line in EMEA. In the Americas, flavor solutions, constant currency sales rose 11%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth and seasonings was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low margin business. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15% with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 2% impact from discontinuing the private label product line I mentioned earlier. EMEA's Flavor solutions outstanding growth was driven by pricing and was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. Volume and mix outside the product discontinuation declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses, mainly packaged food and beverage customers as well as QSRs. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor solution sales grew 22% in constant currency with a 13% volume benefit in China due to lapping the prior year COVID-related disruption, an 8% increase from pricing actions and a 1% increase in all other volume and mix driven by Australia. As seen on slide 20, gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period, reflecting our unwavering focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs. The continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the last two years as we planned, and favorable product mix in both segments. We offset current year inflation in the second quarter with our pricing. Notably, in flavor solutions, while we continue to incur some level of higher cost to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. We continue to make progress on reducing the level of these costs. And as we expected, the second quarter's dual running costs we experienced in the U.K. were comparable to last year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year. Now moving to slide 21, selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A increased relative to the second quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI lead and GOE savings. Brand marketing increased compared to the second quarter of last year and we are expecting an even more significant year-over-year increase in the third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 20 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher SG&A costs resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 36%, compared to the second quarter of 2022. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income increased 24% and the Flavor Solutions segment grew 66%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 22. Our interest expense increased significantly over the second quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3%, compared to 18.6% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 23, second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, as compared to $0.48 for the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. On slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was strong. $394 million in 2023, compared to $154 million for the first half of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory, as well as lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $209 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $119 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on slide 25. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance, as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact in the first-half of the year, and projected favorable impact in the second-half. For fiscal 2023, we are reaffirming our sales outlook and as Lawrence mentioned, we are raising adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by our strong year-to-date performance, combined with the robust demand we continue to expect and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure. At the top line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we have taken in 2023, we expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment, a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. And finally, the continual pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. We estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA Flavor Solution private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2022, compared to our prior guidance 25 basis points to 75 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI led and GOE programs and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged for the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 8% to 10% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 10% to 12%, compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low-single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI leg cost savings target of approximately $85 million. We continue to anticipate a meaningful step up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in the third quarter of 2023. The net impact of these interest related items is expected to be approximately 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 10% to 12% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items, I just mentioned impacting profit. The GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest, and tax headwind of 9%. This resulted in an expected increase of 3% to 5% or projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.60 to $2.65. Before turning it back to Brendan, I would like to recap the key takeaways I've seen on slide 27. Our second quarter sales growth reflects sustained demand across our business and the effective execution of our strategies. Our pricing actions are in place and our volume of performance improved. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our cost savings programs are yielding results in line with our expectations. Our year-to-date results combined with continued robust demand expectations and our actions to optimize our cost structure, bolster our confidence in delivering the strong operating performance projected in our enhanced 2023 outlook.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some additional comments. First, I would like to say, I am truly honored and excited about the opportunity to lead this great company with its rich and very promising future. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great, fast growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose minded practices continues to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. We are the global leader in flavor from end-to-end for our consumers and our customers. As we look ahead to the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. We have compelling growth plans in place, including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with successful execution of our plans and concrete actions, we will realize the profitable growth reflected in our updated 2023 financial outlook. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and execution of our proven strategies further bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory in both segments, particularly as the environment begins to normalize. Remaining relentless with our focus on growth, performance and people combined with the compounding impact of our continued growth investments and alignment with consumer trends underscores McCormick's position to deliver long-term differentiated growth. Our fundamentals remain strong and we expect to continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry leading pace. Importantly, I'd like to personally thank Lawrence for his mentorship and continued service to McCormick. On behalf of shareholders and employees, I want to recognize his outstanding leadership as CEO of this great company. Lawrence has been a transformational leader for McCormick, bringing our global flavor platform to life through his entrepreneurial spirit, innovated thinking, and growth oriented vision for company. During his time as CEO, we have grown sales over 50% and market capitalization more than doubled, creating significant shareholder value. We have prioritized investing to drive future growth, increase our profit realization, improved cash flow from operations and have returned more than $2.5 million to shareholders. Lawrence is widely credited with embedding purpose led performance into McCormick's culture by championing the company's industry-leading sustainability efforts, driving a period of tremendous growth, performance, and expansion, including acquisitions of iconic brands like Frank's RedHot, French's, Cholula, as well as FONA, and successfully leading McCormick through the unprecedented global pandemic. This is an enviable track record, congratulations, and we look forward to your continued support as Executive Chairman. Now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much. First, I just wanted to congratulate both of you, Lawrence, and Brendan, on last evening's announcement. I know McCormick puts a tremendous amount of effort into succession planning, and I'm sure this transition will go every bit as smoothly as previous ones.\nBrendan Foley: Well, thank you, Andrew. That's very kind of you to say that.\nLawrence Kurzius: And Andrew, thank you very much for that as well. I'm glad you mentioned that McCormick does this very well. McCormick pride ourselves of leadership development and succession planning, and the Board and I have been very thoughtful and deliberate in a multiyear process to get us at this point. Over the last few years, I've had a chance to partner with Brendan of many of our key initiatives, and his disciplined approach to delivering growth are leading the qualities you've come to expect McCormick bank of an ideal CEO for this company going forward. With the appointment to President last year, we were signaling this. And we have given all of you on this call and off this call, an opportunity to get to know Brendan and see his qualities first hand.\nAndrew Lazar: Good stuff. Good stuff. I've got just two questions. First one would be McCormick essentially flowed through the second quarter EPS upside to the full-year, but also did not flow through any of the more significant upside in 1Q to the year. So I'm trying to get a sense whether this is simply some conservatism, or is there something in the back half of the year that change that requires either the need from our marketing or it's really just McCormick being sort of opportunistic on the increased marketing in 3Q?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I'll say that, first of all, we are confident in our outlook for the back half of the year. There's a lot that's exciting within the business, and we're pleased with our execution so far this year. The biggest part of the year still is in front of us. Third and fourth quarter are two largest quarters of the year. And so while we are optimistic, we also want to be prudent about what is still in front of us. There are some puts and takes in the business overall. Our recovery in China has been a bit slower than we expected, and we have factored that into our guidance. Whereas, for the most part, everything else is moving in the right direction, and we're quite positive. So we're not trying to signal anything. We did want to reflect the fact that we have had strong performance year-to-date and the increase in our guidance and to reflect -- reflecting that strong performance, but we also didn't want to get ahead of our -- get over the tips of our skis.\nAndrew Lazar: And then second, as we think about the back half of the year and McCormick starting to lap some of the pricing, would your expectations still be that volume would turn positive? And if so, what would be the key drivers that give you the sort of the visibility to that?\nLawrence Kurzius: I'm going to say a few words about that, and I'm going to let Brendan pick it up. But as we have been saying all along, we expect our volume performance to improve as we go through the year and to be stronger in the second-half versus the first-half. And that outlook has not changed. Given that we have slightly softer volumes in China in our outlook, we have a little bit less contribution from that part of the business. But in the second-half, overall, as a company, we're expecting volumes to be very close to flat. Call it, plus or minus 1% and maybe we're talking about numbers that are really not meaningful and well within the range of forecast there.\nBrendan Foley: Just to build on that from a regional perspective, Andrew. In the Americas, yes, we're performing pretty much as planned. I think you have to look at sort of volume and price together when we take a look at the profile. But we're showing sequential improvement across the portfolio, and that's been fairly consistent, sort of, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter so far. And we also need to recognize that in the second quarter result, it does include, kind of, the exit of this DSD business, which when you take that out, I think it kind of underscores the warrants is kind of broader view of what we think is going to kind of unfold in the back half. But it is broadly an improvement versus the first. China, we think we're going to have a strong recovery. Also, pretty confident in that, although it's a little bit less than just kind of a more gradual recovery than what we initially had planned for. So that's probably a little bit different than what we had been thinking about previously. But nevertheless, it is still a strong recovery. And I would say, in EMEA, we're pretty pleased with the performance on volume. And when you factor out the elements of Russia exit or overall, the underlying volume and mix when you exclude that was really actually pretty nice. So we're pleased to see that we have some volume growth despite those things in the EMEA region. On to the whole idea of this just to provide more color on this DSD exit, I would say that this is a business that we've been trying to kind of improve over time. And what we see from it is that this is -- the DSD portion that we delivered to store, we also have a warehouse and distribution delivery that we would handle. And that was a business that just simply wasn't profitable, and we decided we need to exit, but it was a meaningful chunk, I think, out of the second quarter, about 2 points. So as we transition away from that business, it will probably be an impact for the rest of the year, but something that we have planned for.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much and congratulations again.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks and please accept my sincere congratulations as well, Lawrence, Brendan, and Kasey, too. Everyone's moving up in the world, it\u2019s great to see. I think I'm contractually obligated after yesterday to ask how you're feeling about, I guess, your customers' inventory levels in general? And if you're sensing, you know, maybe any risk of a retail safety stock deload or anything similar as your supply chain continues to normalize and get back to where it was?\nLawrence Kurzius: Brendan, why don't you take that one.\nBrendan Foley: Ken, thanks for the question. We're not experiencing anything unusual or significant trade inventory destocking. Honestly, there's really how much drama in the quarter for us on this. The difference between our sales and consumption was more attributable to just the retail sell-through of the discontinued items, and the point I just made regarding DSD is an example of that. But also, we have higher listing fees this quarter just due to the fact that we're launching more new products. And so I think you see that in lot of our dialogue in terms of Cholula or Grill Mates items for grilling or at Tabitha brown line, so we definitely had that. But as we anticipated, our alignment between consumption and shipments is normalizing. There's not really anything unusual going on in this quarter.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I'll underscore that our service levels have been pretty solid for quite a while now. So retailers have had plenty of time to adjust their stock levels and so on. So this actually seems like something over the past 1.5 years has already occurred for us.\nKen Goldman: Got it. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask a little bit about the commentary about Europe and the Consumer side. Maybe some of the softness you're seeing with your -- or sorry, the Flavor Solutions side. And just how you're seeing that progress as we go into the current quarter, is it still worsening? Just trying to get a sense for how some of your larger customers, whether it be food, beverage or QSR are performing as the year progresses.\nBrendan Foley: Hey, Ken, on the Flavor Solutions side of our business in EMEA, definitely, it's been softer than what we would have expected, I think, mostly because we're just seeing a slowing of consumer demand from our customers. And that would be both, sort of, food and beverage and -- but I would say, it's most coming through the quick-serve restaurant customer channel. And that -- we think it's really more of a reflection of what we see happening and what's being reported, I think, in terms of overall inflationary impact in EMEA, specifically Europe. But definitely, as we kind of noted in the remarks leading into the call here, that is something that is probably more affecting our overall volume rate in the EMEA region.\nMike Smith: I think too, just to add a little color on the volume there. About one-third of that decrease in volume is due to the exit of that private label, the two service lines. So again, another portfolio optimization.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. And that it was actually contemplated in our plans for the beginning of the year. Maybe for customer relations reasons, we couldn't be specific about that, but that is not a surprise to us.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning and congratulations again to Brendan and to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Guys, thank you for the commentary, I guess, on the exit of DSD. I think it's helpful, particularly in the context of some questions we've been getting this morning around the Consumer business. So appreciate that, I guess, maybe what I wanted to pick up on in Americas Consumer, specifically some of your comments around grilling. You do obviously have pretty easy compares from last year just given where kind of protein prices were. So curious just kind of what you saw coming out of Memorial Day, what you're expecting over the course of the summer. Obviously, you have some specific things that you're working on, but anything you can help with us there?\nBrendan Foley: Thanks for the question, Peter. We're off to a really good start on grilling for this summer season, and we definitely saw that as a good start in Q2. A lot of it's really driven by just -- if you think about we have a solid innovation plan, I think, for the grilling season, we're launching some new grilling items. Plus we're also in just really much healthier supply on mustard and Frank's RedHot. And these are areas in Lawry\u2019s marinades, where if we look at last year and before that, certainly we're coming on top of now a period of where we just have really full supply, assured supply for our customers, and we're turning back on normal promotional activity on the business. So we feel like all of those things put together, innovation, supply, getting back to the way you want to run a season on grilling, we have a really good start to the year. And as we look at it kind of from a share standpoint, we really probably performed quite well kicking off in the second quarter. So all those things come together, I think, for a great start to the summer season.\nPeter Galbo: Great. No, that's helpful. And maybe just a question for Mike around kind of the gross margin guidance. Just where you\u2019ve covered in the first-half of the year, kind of what it implies about the back half, maybe there's some conservatism in there. But I did notice you kind of didn't change the inflation guide, maybe just help us kind of think about that over the balance of the year?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean, for the year, Peter, as you know, we did raise our guidance on gross margin, 25 basis points to 75 basis points to 50 basis points to 100 basis points. So we reflected some of the increased pricing realization we talked about in the call. We're really, really doing well in our GOE program and realizing those savings and those ramp up in the second-half. The thing about the second quarter, that 300 basis point improvement, second quarter last year was our worst performance of the year. You'll see improvements in the back half and basis points versus last year, but they won't be as big as the 300 we had in the second quarter.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Mike, maybe, sorry go ahead.\nLawrence Kurzius: Go ahead. Finish this line of\u2026\nPeter Galbo: Sure. Yes, Mike, maybe though -- understanding maybe not the same magnitude of year-over-year change, but sequentially, margins tend still improve in the back half of the year. So just curious kind of how you're thinking about that?\nMike Smith: I mean, based on the mix of our business, generally, the back half does have higher margins, especially in the fourth quarter. Our implied guidance has high of almost 90 basis points improvement, lows 0s, so you get a little bit of a squeeze factor there. But if we continue to have success, and again, we see that ramp up in the second-half. China is going to have a really strong recovery in Q4, that's a positive for us. We have scale over there and have good margins.\nLawrence Kurzius: I mean, we're quite optimistic with continued gross margin improvement and operating profit margin improvement as we go through the year and going forward.\nMike Smith: I guess, Lawrence said, everything is moving in the right direction.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Got it.\nLawrence Kurzius: Peter, you know, I'm not sure that we -- I know that you've got some interest in the DSD exit, so I just want to spend a second with you and elaborate on that. This is a range of very -- there are a lot of units, but they're very low value. We're talking to sell a bag spices and dried peppers in settle bags that largely moved through unscanned channels, and we've had a DSD business in that, that we've banged our head against for a long time and we've chosen as part of optimizing our portfolio, improving the profit performance to exit that part of the business, we still sell those same brands through the warehouse to major customers where -- because of the difference in the distribution channel, the margins are attractive and worth -- and the business is worth staying in. But the DSD portion of it was just not a moneymaker. It's a lot of units, but not a lot of value.\nPeter Galbo: Got it, very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations all around. Thank you so much for everything to all of you. Okay, first question, regaining lost distribution in U.S. retail channels. It seems to me that there were a number of smaller retailers that ended up -- you ended up losing distribution during those supply chain disruptions. As you start to rebuild that distribution, what innings are we in? And are you able to quantify how much of a tailwind that could be over the next year to 18 months?\nBrendan Foley: Well, Alexia, thank you for the question on TDPs and overall distribution. First of all, I'd like to say, we continue to make really good progress year-to-date. And as we look at our performance and our trends and all the different metrics we might look at, we're happy to see that come through as a positive, especially in the second quarter. And we do expect to see continued progress as we go into the back half. We have some significant improvements that we know will start to come online just because as customers reset their shelves, and those things start to happen. A lot of the wins that we get through category management and all of that really important effort we put forth in terms of help the retailer guide the category. We know that there's going to be some helpful improvements coming through on that as we go to the back half. I'm reluctant to kind of quantify all that as we think about that into the back half of \u201823 and all the way into \u201824. But this is an effort, as we've said before, that we're going to continue to be working on over the course of not only this year, but also next year. And as we look at overall distribution, we know that we're not going to get all of that back in terms of rough points, because almost half of that was discontinuations originally. So we feel really good about our progress right now on an overall distribution points, and it should continue to improve as we go through \u201823 and also in \u201824.\nLawrence Kurzius: And Alexia, as I said on our last quarterly call, we have a tremendous amount of innovation. And on top of that, the restoration of our U.S. Everyday spice line starting to hit the market in Q2 and building through the second-half of the year. All of those hands on the shelf give us opportunities to get a more advantageous set and to get a greater amount of distribution on the shelf. We have a number of major customer wins that we talked about in the first quarter that are actually going on shelf in Q3, which should further build on TDP. So we're pretty confident continue to see improvement in those areas we have through the year.\nMike Smith: And then with our brand marketing, we're going to be mid-single-digit increase in the second half. A lot of that's going to go into the third quarter that are willing to support those plans.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And as a follow-up, can you just give us an overview of the one-time costs that are going to be eliminated by 2024? I seem to remember you have two plants running in the U.K. as you transition there, there's co-manufacturing costs here in the U.S. Just a sort of idea of how much more there is to come out that's onetime from recent events?\nMike Smith: Okay. Let me think about that. So you're referring to -- we have dual running costs in our EMEA region, due to our new large facility over there. I feel -- I think, I'm pretty sure I said in the last call, we're around $20 million for this year, which is about the same as last year. We're still going to have some cost next year, because it's going to go into the first and second quarter, the transition, because these are large manufacturing facilities. So if I were winging it, I'd say half of that is going to go away, but I'm going to be off, depending on the exact timing.\nAlexia Howard: Great.\nLawrence Kurzius: And of course, our GOE program continues next year.\nMike Smith: Yes, yes. We'll see a nice wrap into 2024 from that.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Great, good morning. And congratulations to everyone as well from me. Two questions both related to Flavor Solutions. The first one, in part as a follow-up to the topic that Ken Goldman had raised, just around inventory dynamics. We've heard various discussions of potential customer destocking from a Flavor Solutions perspective, as well from different pockets of the industry. I was just curious to see if that's at all impacting you or if you expect it to impact the business over the second half of the year?\nBrendan Foley: Steve, thanks for the question. As it relates to our Flavor Solutions business, when we look at overall, our volume mix profile on it, taking into account, sort of, the exit discussions that we've already had and other impacts, we think our volume profile right now reflects, kind of, the categories that we choose to really focus in on like performance nutrition and seasonings and health and nutrition. These are areas that we still see a lot of healthy growth in and those have been intentionally, kind of, area of growth and focus for us. And so I don't know that we're -- and I won't be able to comment specifically on any particular customer activity, but we believe our volume profile, kind of, reflects more of that composition of our business. And I'm not sure that we're seeing any broad restocking discussions that we have with customers at this point in time.\nLawrence Kurzius: I'll also agree that a lot of customer wins and believe we're gaining share in this space, and so that is a positive contributor for us as well.\nMike Smith: A lot of our growth in flavor solutions comes from innovations too. And those are the things that really drive volume and margin in Flavor Solutions.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Great. Great. And then my second question, actually, a good segue, is on the margin front. Just because you continue to trend well ahead of at least our expectations year-to-date on Flavor Solution's margin recovery. And I guess if you think about that forward, maybe I was wondering if you could just frame for us how much or whether you expect further progress on that front in the second-half. And then any updates as to how the progress you are making here year-to-date influences how you think about that build back to pre-pandemic levels or higher as you look out over the longer term?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean I'd say, one, we're very pleased with our margin progress. As we stated on the call, a lot of -- everything is moving in the right direction, the GOE program, portfolio optimization, things like that are helping both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side. Like I said in the last call, pre-pandemic, we were -- our Flavor Solutions margins were a little over 14%. We don't look at that as a ceiling, however. Longer term, with portfolio migration, we think we will go higher. Short term-wise, we have strong belief we'll get back to 14%. It's not going to be this year, but we're going to see sequential improvement. And quarter-to-quarter, there will be lumpiness based on run cost and good running cost, things like that. So -- but we had a really good second quarter. It was an easy comp, compared to Q2 of last year, but we're pretty bullish on Flavor Solutions' recovery.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I will just add to that, just if I can step it up to the total company level, it's hard not to be excited about the 280 basis point expansion in operating margin that we had this quarter. We're really moving in the right direction in both of our segments in a big way. And we\u2019ve all seen that we raised OP guidance for the year, it's a long time, on the back of that margin improvement. And we're very pleased and -- we're pleased with our progress in this area.\nSteve Powers: Great, thanks for that and congratulations again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. And congrats, everyone. I want to return to the gross margin question with regard to the second-half. So it was nice to see the better-than-expected gross margin expansion in the quarter. And when I look at the updated guidance range, it would seem to imply that, versus pre-pandemic basis, so whether that means fiscal year \u201818 or fiscal year \u201819, that we actually see some reversion in your progress towards gross margin recovery? I'm trying to tie what's implied by that guidance range versus what we're hearing in terms of cost savings ramping up, pricing catching up to inflation, supply chain improving. All of which I would have thought could lead to gross margins continuing to move closer to pre-pandemic levels as we go through the year. And I do recognize that 3Q and 4Q are big quarters for you, and there's probably some prudence embedded in this outlook. But I just wanted to get some clarity on that point? Thank you.\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean what you have to remember, Max, is when you're pricing to cover costs over a multi-year time you're going to have a large dilution impact just due to the math. And we said before, I mean, that has been a large headwind last year, but I think we quantified in the 200 basis point to 300 basis point range as the margin line. We haven't talked about it much this year, but we're still having some of that. We will get that back over time as we said, through our CCI programs, more normal cost inflation in the future. So it's hard to compare the four years ago to gross margin at this point, but a lot of that is dilution, but we see an upward trajectory as we see in the second quarter. That's the important thing. What makes me really excited is even with over -- we're catching up on the pricing we've under recovered the last two years. Even with that, that is a negative dilution impact. Even with that, we're showing gross margin impact, a positive based on the GOE program or the CCI programs. So that really gives us confidence going forward.\nMax Gumport: Got it. Understood. And then turning to the recovery in your TDPs and U.S. spices and seasoning, so it's been nice to see that, and the scanner data that we all track and it does seem to be approaching, sort of, flat year-over-year performance. But we're not seeing a pickup in dollar share yet as significantly. And I would think there should be some natural act, because as you get the distribution points, maybe then you can start to advertise and bring back the brand building more fully as you've flagged today. Is that the right way to think about it? Should we start to see a more full improvement in dollar share as we move through the year in terms of the trends?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Just like we've seen in our current trends, Max, the sequential sales unit, and volume improvement across the portfolio and even specifically within spices and extracts in Americas, we do think that reflects, kind of, those long-term tailwinds of our categories, but also our growth plans. So we continue to invest in brand marketing, really focused category management and innovation. And that allows us to kind of focus on those volumes and that sustainable growth, and also get that compounding effect of those investments. So yes, I do expect that profile to improve as we go through the back half. As you called out, reasonably the improvement in TDP, we should also then start to see an improvement overall as we think about dollar share. And so that is a reasonable thing I think to look out for. What is driving our performance right now and we think will, as we continue moving forward, is increased distribution, brand marketing, category management and innovation, and we also see a similar trend on this in Europe. So these are areas that we continue to put a lot of focus up against. And I would say our outlook is -- as everyone has said so far this morning, I guess, I'm going to say it, too. Everything is moving in the right direction. So we feel that same way about our external performance off shelf.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I don't want to miss that there are big -- as noted, I don't want anyone to miss it. And we've got share gains in Europe, we've got share gains in -- I don't know if you guys mentioned it, in Australia and Asia. And we have share gains in our other categories, the spices, and seasonings, certainly in the U.S. is certainly an important area of focus and justifiable. So we're confident that we're going to get there. We're following the same playbook, as we've said at CAGNY, that we did for recipe mixes and believe that we're going to get to the same with that.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my congratulations to Lawrence, Brendan, and the whole team. I guess just first, making sure -- there's a lot of ground have been covered today. If you think about some of the cadence of earnings and margins, just the headwinds on a year-on-year basis from, kind of, from incentive comp, how much of that has actually been realized in the first-half as we think about layering that into the back half of the year? And then, again, maybe coming back to this question on gross margins, the sequential cadence. I mean, historically, second-half gross margins would be higher than the first particularly in the fourth quarter, given that's your biggest volume quarter. It doesn't seem to imply -- so the guidance doesn't seem to imply much gross margin improvement in the second-half from where you were in the second quarter? And I'm just trying to make -- is that just mix between the different business units or just conservatism? Is there something on price cost and mix in there that we're missing? I'm just -- usually, there's a bigger step up certainly in the fourth quarter, it doesn't seem to be implied even at the high end of the guidance range?\nMike Smith: Yes. Like we said last call on SG&A, I mean, on incentive bill back, it's mostly in the second-half. But the second quarter, if you remember back to the second quarter of last year, it was really difficult quarter, as I mentioned before. So we were obviously making adjustments to incentive comp there. So some of that did come through in Q2, but the majority of it is second-half back loaded. As far as gross margin, I think -- just at a very high level, I mean, we talked a lot about gross margin on this call. We're optimistic, but prudent. I mean we've got a lot of things that are -- we're putting points on the board in the GOE program. Pricing -- I'd say pricing realization is going to be highest in the first quarter and second quarter it's going to ramp down. So that's a little bit of that. And we're still having low to mid-teen cost inflation that we haven't moved on, so that's coming down. But at the end of the day, from a gross margin perspective, we're going to show improvement. And again, we're being prudent.\nLawrence Kurzius: Yes. And I want to be sure we're differentiating -- because your question, actually, I'm confused a little bit. Our gross margin in our underlying business is always higher in third and fourth quarter. That's a mix of the business, and that's the natural state. I think you're asking -- it sounds like you might be asking about that. We're expecting that relationship still holds, and we are expecting to continue to have improvement versus prior year in both those quarters as well.\nAdam Samuelson: Thanks you, Lawrence. And certainly -- versus the 37.1% in the second quarter. And I appreciate that, that gets you higher year-on-year versus where you were last year in the second-half. And I guess, 100 basis points for the consolidated company, kind of, you do the back into the second-half gross margin percentage, it doesn't really get you much above 37% for the second-half of the year in total, and the quarters will mix a little bit. So -- but usually, you would think that the gross margin percent would be higher by 4Q, that's the\u2026\nMike Smith: The gross margin change in the first-half, we were favorable, up 113 basis points to last year. The second-half guidance implies 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So we're showing improvement. Remember that second quarter last year, we had a really positive 300-some basis points increase in Q2. So that's a bit of why it's over 100 basis points in the first-half. But 50 basis points improvement, we're happy with that.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there and pass the line. Thank you.\nMike Smith: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Smith: Hi, good morning and congratulations. Wanted to ask a follow-up question on the Consumer business in the Americas or more specifically in the U.S. We've seen elasticities improve in recent periods in measured channel data, and now you're ramping up new product activity and marketing along with what sounds like some positive distribution tailwinds. So how should we think about elasticity in the second-half? With consideration to the commentary on your outlook talking about elasticities overall in line with the prior year, which are a little softer than the trends we're currently seeing in the U.S.?\nBrendan Foley: I think, first of all, it's important to call out that our base case has been for the Consumer to be under pressure in 2023, and we expect that to kind of continue. And although broadly speaking, the Consumer has held up better-than-expected. Yet, there is still pressure out there. Having said that, though, as we look at our own price elasticities and performance off shelf, it remains pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, most recently. And so we're not seeing a big deviation from where we've been. And in fact, I would say we had a retail price increase come through in early April, and we still see very consistent trends with regard to price elasticity. We don't see any examples right now of it yet or planning to getting worse. But then also, I'm not sure that we're indicating so far that it's getting measurably better. But these are consistent trends that we're planning on for the rest of the year, because we are still on our base case of a pressured Consumer.\nLawrence Kurzius: I would say though that there's a good, solid sustained demand from the Consumer. And as you take that with the -- I think, really robust and compelling growth plans that we've got in the second-half, we're -- we've a good reason to believe that we're going to continue to see volume improvement in our U.S. business specifically as we go through the year.\nMatt Smith: Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could ask one more on a follow-up on the recovery you're seeing in China. It contributed growth in the quarter, but you've talked about how it lagged your expectations and it's progressing more slowly. But could you talk about the momentum in the business exiting the quarter? Did you see sequential improvement through the quarter? And how does the current consumer environment, compared to year-ago levels, which were more normal in the second quarter?\nBrendan Foley: Well, I think in terms of -- did we see a sequential improvement or any sequential changes as we went through the quarter? No, I would say that, largely, as we observed, kind of, the performance in the quarter in China, the one thing that was obvious is they're dealing with higher unemployment. And Consumer spending isn't as robust as maybe many and all of us were planning on, yet still being a strong rebound, but we weren't seeing any sort of different performance throughout the quarter, I would say, it was pretty much consistent. And our view, once we saw the quarter open up, it sort of held that way throughout the end of the second quarter. I think your question though -- in the back half of your question, maybe you meant on sort of how we're thinking about the third quarter. And recall last year though, that was a big rebound period in recovery with China in the third quarter. So we don't expect that same level of recovery in the third quarter this year just, because we're comparing up against that. But we expect those same trends to kind of flow through into the third quarter. And then again, when we get to the fourth, it's going to be different yet again. So we're going to be comparing against a very challenging period with respect to COVID lockdowns, et cetera. And so that is likely to feel more like the second quarter.\nMike Smith: Yes. So maybe in summary, Q3 is a tough comparison on China, because it's a strong recovery last year. Q4 is an easier comparison because they were locked down in the fourth quarter last year.\nLawrence Kurzius: And we just actually had our China management team here in the office a couple of days ago, and we spent quite a lot of time with them talking about the roller coaster ride that they have been on as the economy reopened, lockdown, reopened, lockdown, reopen. And that creates a lot of noise in the year-to-year comparison. We all -- the question about how robust the recovery in China was going to be? It's really strong. I don't want anyone on the call to think otherwise. Our question all along has been is the recovery going to -- is the performance going to -- is the growth is going to start with a two or three or four? Right now, it looks like a three, not a four. And -- but -- so we have actually tempered our -- not just captured it in our results today, but we've also tempered our outlook a little bit for China that is considered in our guidance, I would say it.\nMatt Smith: Okay, thank you for that. I\u2019ll leave it there and pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thank you for getting me in and Lawrence and Brendan, congratulations to both of you. Especially you, Lawrence. It's really been a pleasure working with you all these years.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you so much, Rob. And welcome back by the way. Congratulations to you.\nBrendan Foley: Congratulations to you.\nRobert Moskow: Yes. Well, we're -- I'm a little jealous of you. So -- but -- I got to be honest. But I wanted to follow-up on, Brendan, what you said about what your consumer research says about preferences for brands versus private label. I think you said the consumers prefer brands. The market share data shows that private label is growing and has been growing every year for the last couple of years, I think. And I want to know if your data is showing the same thing in terms of market share and how do you reconcile those two things together in the U.S.?\nBrendan Foley: Well, I mean, I think we have to acknowledge that there has been some trade down to private label, especially more recently. And -- but also, it has moderated, especially I think in our own categories, as we see more pricing on shelf coming from private label. Those gaps narrow, and so therefore, sort of, the unit growth and trends, sort of, decelerate and we're seeing our own unit trends show sequential improvement. But going back to sort of the idea of research and what consumers are telling us and what we're -- we keep finding and it keeps you reinforced with consumer feedback is they're looking for value, not necessarily the cheapest path of smaller items. And we do see consistently consumers do prefer brands. And a lot of what we've been trying to do when we think about just the mix between private label and brand recall, we're also in the private label business with our customers. So we see a role for private label in our categories. And so we are obviously supported from a category management standpoint that both provide a range of offerings for the consumer. Right now, we are pushing a lot on value. We're really focused on the growth of our line sizes. We're seeing consumer shift there more and more as they look for that greater value, and it's definitely showing through in our trends. But it's not dilutive to us or to the retailer. We're not seeing as many signs of trade down right now as maybe we saw during sort of the hype of this inflationary period that we've been going through. If I were to go back to over several years, a little bit harder to comment on category by category, but we typically see this happen during inflationary or recessionary times for private label. It certainly seems to -- appears to gain share. But then again, we're not hitting sort of the highs that are different from what we've seen in previous periods. So that's our perspective on it, but we are certainly, kind of, have our foot in both parts of the category.\nRobert Moskow: Great. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kurzius for any final comments.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you. Well, before we end, I'd like to let all of you in the analyst and investor community know, I have appreciated the opportunity to tell you about McCormick, our great company, and for the insights and the perspective you've provided me, which helped shape our strategies and clarify our messaging. You have all really helped me be a better CEO. Whether you have a buy, a hold or sell on us and whether you've even held our shares, our many interactions have been transparent, constructive, and always mutually respectful. I want to thank you all, and I'm confident McCormick is well positioned for continued success with our alignment to consumer trends, the breadth and reach of our portfolio, as well as our strategic growth investments. We have a strong foundation for sustainable growth and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me. And as we enter the summer season and for some of you in the U.S., the 4th of July, and Canada have to make energize, fire up those grills with the McCormick products. This concludes this morning's conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. To start, last night, we announced that Brendan Foley will become McCormick's next Chief Executive Officer on September 1, and he is joining the Board of Directors immediately. I could not be more pleased with Brendan as my successor. I will continue to serve McCormick and all of its stakeholders as Executive Chairman of the Board once Brendan becomes CEO. This is a transition that we have been planning internally as part of an orderly multi-year succession plan, and it's exciting to finally share the news with all of you. As many of you know, Brendan is exceptionally well qualified and prepared to lead McCormick. He deeply understands the importance of delivering continued strong growth, while doing the right things for people, communities, and the planet. With our advantaged competitive positioning, supported by the growing demand for flavor and with our tremendous depth of talent, I have utmost confidence that McCormick, under Brendan's leadership, will continue to drive differentiated growth and long-term shareholder value. Congratulations, Brendan. Now on to our earnings update. First, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan will provide the business segment update, Mike will provide details on our financial results and 2023 outlook, and after your questions, I will have some final comments. Starting with our second quarter results. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance, which reflects sustained demand across our business and effective execution of our strategy. We delivered double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our pricing actions are in place and, importantly, our volume performance improved. We continue to see top line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth. Additionally, we drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our global operating effectiveness or GOE program, which includes the optimization of our supply chain cost structure, is yielding results. We grew adjusted earnings per share of 25% driven by significant adjusted operating income growth, and despite interest rate and tax headwinds. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations more than doubled driven by higher earnings, I just mentioned and working capital improvements. Notably, we're reducing inventory levels as planned. Both segments in all regions contributed with strong growth. Our results benefited from our recovery in China. And while the timing and pace of recovery in our China business was less robust than anticipated, it was still strong, and we are confident in the contribution China will provide to our results as the year progresses. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results during the first half of 2023. Our year-to-date results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our growth trajectory as we enter the second-half of the year. As such, we are raising our adjusted operating income and earnings per share outlook for the full-year. Turning to slide five. In the second quarter, we drove 8% sales growth or 10% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong business performance, with an 11% contribution from pricing and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Netted in this volume decline are net 1% volume increase from China recovery, partially offset by our Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and 1% decline attributable to pruning low-margin business. As examples, we exited direct store delivery, DSD, of our bagged Hispanic products in our Americas consumer segment and a private label food service line in EMEA. From a segment lens, both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments delivered strong sales growth in each region. In the Consumer segment, we continue to have strong price realization and we drove a sequential improvement in volume performance. Flavor Solutions, our exceptional performance continued with our ninth consecutive quarter of constant currency double-digit sales growth. Our sales performance demonstrates the strength of our broad global portfolio and positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. I'd like to share a few highlights about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in a few moments. We drove significant gross margin improvement, reflecting the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged last year. Cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs and the impact of strategic decisions we've made to optimize our portfolio, with a focus on driving margin improvement as we continue to prune low-margin business. Our gross margin expansion in the quarter was partially offset by higher SG&A as we build back incentive compensation as planned. Our adjusted operating income increased by 35% versus the second quarter of last year or, in constant currency, 36%. This growth drove an adjusted earnings per share increase of 25%, which also reflected higher interest and effective tax rate. We remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. We are halfway through the year. Our year-to-date results speak for themselves. We expect to continue driving profitable growth for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvements in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide for their collective power is driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job that McCormick team has done navigating the dynamic environment over the last few years. I'd like to recognize their energy and excitement for the business, which is coming through in our results. Now I'd like to ask Brendan to share the second quarter business updates for our segments. And Andrew, thank you very much for that as well. I'm glad you mentioned that McCormick does this very well. McCormick pride ourselves of leadership development and succession planning, and the Board and I have been very thoughtful and deliberate in a multiyear process to get us at this point. Over the last few years, I've had a chance to partner with Brendan of many of our key initiatives, and his disciplined approach to delivering growth are leading the qualities you've come to expect McCormick bank of an ideal CEO for this company going forward. With the appointment to President last year, we were signaling this. And we have given all of you on this call and off this call, an opportunity to get to know Brendan and see his qualities first hand. Well, I'll say that, first of all, we are confident in our outlook for the back half of the year. There's a lot that's exciting within the business, and we're pleased with our execution so far this year. The biggest part of the year still is in front of us. Third and fourth quarter are two largest quarters of the year. And so while we are optimistic, we also want to be prudent about what is still in front of us. There are some puts and takes in the business overall. Our recovery in China has been a bit slower than we expected, and we have factored that into our guidance. Whereas, for the most part, everything else is moving in the right direction, and we're quite positive. So we're not trying to signal anything. We did want to reflect the fact that we have had strong performance year-to-date and the increase in our guidance and to reflect -- reflecting that strong performance, but we also didn't want to get ahead of our -- get over the tips of our skis. I'm going to say a few words about that, and I'm going to let Brendan pick it up. But as we have been saying all along, we expect our volume performance to improve as we go through the year and to be stronger in the second-half versus the first-half. And that outlook has not changed. Given that we have slightly softer volumes in China in our outlook, we have a little bit less contribution from that part of the business. But in the second-half, overall, as a company, we're expecting volumes to be very close to flat. Call it, plus or minus 1% and maybe we're talking about numbers that are really not meaningful and well within the range of forecast there. Thanks, Andrew. Brendan, why don't you take that one. And I'll underscore that our service levels have been pretty solid for quite a while now. So retailers have had plenty of time to adjust their stock levels and so on. So this actually seems like something over the past 1.5 years has already occurred for us. Yes. And that it was actually contemplated in our plans for the beginning of the year. Maybe for customer relations reasons, we couldn't be specific about that, but that is not a surprise to us. Thank you. Go ahead. Finish this line of... I mean, we're quite optimistic with continued gross margin improvement and operating profit margin improvement as we go through the year and going forward. Peter, you know, I'm not sure that we -- I know that you've got some interest in the DSD exit, so I just want to spend a second with you and elaborate on that. This is a range of very -- there are a lot of units, but they're very low value. We're talking to sell a bag spices and dried peppers in settle bags that largely moved through unscanned channels, and we've had a DSD business in that, that we've banged our head against for a long time and we've chosen as part of optimizing our portfolio, improving the profit performance to exit that part of the business, we still sell those same brands through the warehouse to major customers where -- because of the difference in the distribution channel, the margins are attractive and worth -- and the business is worth staying in. But the DSD portion of it was just not a moneymaker. It's a lot of units, but not a lot of value. And Alexia, as I said on our last quarterly call, we have a tremendous amount of innovation. And on top of that, the restoration of our U.S. Everyday spice line starting to hit the market in Q2 and building through the second-half of the year. All of those hands on the shelf give us opportunities to get a more advantageous set and to get a greater amount of distribution on the shelf. We have a number of major customer wins that we talked about in the first quarter that are actually going on shelf in Q3, which should further build on TDP. So we're pretty confident continue to see improvement in those areas we have through the year. And of course, our GOE program continues next year. I'll also agree that a lot of customer wins and believe we're gaining share in this space, and so that is a positive contributor for us as well. And I will just add to that, just if I can step it up to the total company level, it's hard not to be excited about the 280 basis point expansion in operating margin that we had this quarter. We're really moving in the right direction in both of our segments in a big way. And we've all seen that we raised OP guidance for the year, it's a long time, on the back of that margin improvement. And we're very pleased and -- we're pleased with our progress in this area. And I don't want to miss that there are big -- as noted, I don't want anyone to miss it. And we've got share gains in Europe, we've got share gains in -- I don't know if you guys mentioned it, in Australia and Asia. And we have share gains in our other categories, the spices, and seasonings, certainly in the U.S. is certainly an important area of focus and justifiable. So we're confident that we're going to get there. We're following the same playbook, as we've said at CAGNY, that we did for recipe mixes and believe that we're going to get to the same with that. Yes. And I want to be sure we're differentiating -- because your question, actually, I'm confused a little bit. Our gross margin in our underlying business is always higher in third and fourth quarter. That's a mix of the business, and that's the natural state. I think you're asking -- it sounds like you might be asking about that. We're expecting that relationship still holds, and we are expecting to continue to have improvement versus prior year in both those quarters as well. I would say though that there's a good, solid sustained demand from the Consumer. And as you take that with the -- I think, really robust and compelling growth plans that we've got in the second-half, we're -- we've a good reason to believe that we're going to continue to see volume improvement in our U.S. business specifically as we go through the year. And we just actually had our China management team here in the office a couple of days ago, and we spent quite a lot of time with them talking about the roller coaster ride that they have been on as the economy reopened, lockdown, reopened, lockdown, reopen. And that creates a lot of noise in the year-to-year comparison. We all -- the question about how robust the recovery in China was going to be? It's really strong.

Our question all along has been is the recovery going to -- is the performance going to -- is the growth is going to start with a two or three or four? Right now, it looks like a three, not a four. And -- but -- so we have actually tempered our -- not just captured it in our results today, but we've also tempered our outlook a little bit for China that is considered in our guidance, I would say it. Thank you so much, Rob. And welcome back by the way. Congratulations to you. Thank you.

            "content": "Thank you, Lawrence. Starting with our Consumer segment, on slide eight. Our underlying performance was strong reflecting our price realization and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trends. We continue to see sequential improvement. Now for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew 7%. The difference between our sales and consumption was attributable to the retail sell-through of discontinued items and listing fees for an increase in the new distribution and products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubs items and Tabitha brown line expansions. As anticipated, our alignment between consumption and shipments is normalizing. As usual, we expect some business fluctuations from period-to-period. In spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters with unit strength in core products such as straight fill spices and vanilla, as well as our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration. Lunch-to-date results of our Lawry's everyday spice range continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profits of the category, and like the first quarter, over half of the purchases are from new buyers to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. We also continue to see consumers trade up from private label. As our proprietary research indicates, consumers still preferred brands, even when under economic pressure. Our excitement and distribution for this product line continues to build. The renovation of our U.S. core Everyday Spice in their portfolio is rolling out according to plan and is a seamless transition for our retail partners as it fits into existing shelf spots. At the end of the second quarter we had about 30% of our SKUs on shelf, we will continue to rollout the product over the course of the year and our significant brand marketing campaign will be ramping up at the end of the third quarter. Our larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continue to benefit the category and McCormick with 11% consumption growth in the second quarter as consumers continue to put more at home. Super Deal's purchase cycle is similar to that of smaller sizes even though they are 3 times the volume. And household penetration remains greater than pre-COVID. We kicked off the grilling season at the end of the second quarter and early results are good. Frank's RedHot and Cholula Hot Sauces, French's mustard, Lawry's Marinade's, and McCormick mayonaisa, all delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter. With Stubs barbecue sauce, as well as Grill Mate's seasoning blends and recipe mixes, following close with high-single-digit growth. We are expecting our new grilling products and strong promotions to heat up share performance. We've launched three new Grill Mates on-trend flavors, including Smash Burger and Garlic Butter, as well as Griller's Choice Marinades, which you can use as three different flavors, all have had strong retailer acceptance. We are really excited about our Stubs Real Smoke Rubs, which capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor and Stubb Jalapeno and Honey Barbecue Sauce, which combines two trending flavor profiles and the nuance of heat and flavor that are Frank's Smoke and Sweet Barbecue Wing sauce offers. We are fired up for the grilling season and expect the launch of our fire up brand marketing campaign in the third quarter to fire up consumer demand as well. Our expansion into the fast growing Mexican aisle with Cholula Taco recipe mixes and salsas based on authentic Mexican formulas is off to a great start following our Cinco de Mayo execution. During the third quarter, we are increasing our Cholula brand marketing investments to support our expanded portfolio. Our third quarter brand marketing will also include increasing our investments for our McCormick Gourmet product line with our further for flavor campaign, highlighting our commitment to sustainability from farm to table. With our supply issues of this product line resolved, we are excited to be able to support this premium product offering for the first time in two years. And importantly, as we enter the second-half of the year, it is historically our most significant period. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers, and growing with new products, such as our new Frank Dill Pickle hot sauce on our direct-to-consumer platform, which sold out in less than a week. We will start to expand distribution in stores late this year. In EMEA, our second quarter was strongest quarterly sales performance in two years, our effective pricing accelerated to contribute double-digit growth and our volume performance improved sequentially. And in fact, we grew volume in the U.K. and Eastern Europe. Consumption data continues to indicate the consumer is holding up well in our categories and our share performance is solid. We are growing herbs, spices and seasonings share in Eastern Europe and in Italy, and our growth plans in France are also yielding results with improved share performance. We are excited about celebrating the 60th anniversary of our [Indiscernible] brand this year. We are scaling up our grilling activation in France, and partnering with key retailers to celebrate the brand's anniversary and to spark another reason to celebrate around the grill. In the U.K., we have also kicked off the grilling season and are building out our support and the discount channel featuring our Schwartz Grill Mates products. In both France and the U.K., we will be increasing our third quarter brand marketing investments to support grilling, as well as new products and to continue to emphasize our value messaging. Across the region, we are making meaningful progress in the fast growing discount channel, expanding distribution, and gaining share. Finally, we are gaining share of the U.K. hot sauce category. We continue to drive strong Frank's RedHot performance and are accelerating our Cholula growth. With new distribution and e-commerce multi-packs, contributing significantly to our hot sauce growth. Overall, our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proven to be effective and are driving growth in EMEA. In the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter reflected lapping the COVID related disruptions in China. While our business is recovering and our second quarter growth was robust, it was lower than our expectations as the pace of reopening is proving to be more gradual and consumer spending was pressured by broad-based economic pressures in region. We remain optimistic for a more normal operating environment emerging as the year progresses and we enter into 2024, driving sustainable growth as we executed on our strategies. Outside of China, new products and brand marketing initiatives drove double-digit growth in other markets with strength and branded spices and seasonings and Frank's RedHot. Wrapping up to consumer update, we are fueling our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved, and we're using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. Our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past, before, during and after the pandemic. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories, and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our leadership in core categories. Now turning to flavor solutions on slide 10. We are continuing our outstanding sales growth momentum in this segment. As Lawrence already mentioned, second quarter was our ninth consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. We have previously shared our commitment to restoring profitability in this segment, and the second quarter is marketing an inflection point toward our objective to continuing to build our margin. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions, we are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lag the last two years. Recovery in the second quarter was even greater than the first. Now for regional highlights. Our Americas second quarter strong sales growth was led by our flavors product category. Within flavors, seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products, which is outpacing last year's new product contribution, as well as our strength in our customers' iconic products. We are winning in seasonings with our heat platform, flavors for performance nutrition beverages, and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new products for existing and new customers. In branded food service, we continue to gain share in hot sauce, mustard, spices, and seasonings, with strength this quarter in Grill Mates and Lawry's. Our grilling portfolio is firing up in branded food service just like in our consumer segment. Moving to EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the second quarter. Overall, our price realization accelerated again from last quarter. Notably, we grew sales constant currency 15% in the quarter despite an impact from pruning low margin business as Lawrence mentioned earlier, and softness in some of our QSR impacted food and beverage customers' volume within their own business. And in APZ, we also experienced recovery in China and are encouraged about the return to normal as growth was also driven by strong performance of our quick service restaurant customers' promotions. Outside of China, we delivered double-digit growth with effective price realization, as well as solid volume growth driven by demand from QSRs. The strength of our flavor solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary inspired innovation are driving our outstanding flavor solutions momentum. The power of McCormick and FONA together continues to create exciting growth opportunities in the technically insulated and value-added part of our portfolio especially with our recent wins in Healthy Nutrition. And in branded food service, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, and culinary partnerships to drive continued growth. Our robust plans of flavor solutions bolster our confidence and continuing our growth trajectory and driving our flavor solutions leadership. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance. Thank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some additional comments. First, I would like to say, I am truly honored and excited about the opportunity to lead this great company with its rich and very promising future. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great, fast growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose minded practices continues to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. We are the global leader in flavor from end-to-end for our consumers and our customers. As we look ahead to the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. We have compelling growth plans in place, including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with successful execution of our plans and concrete actions, we will realize the profitable growth reflected in our updated 2023 financial outlook. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and execution of our proven strategies further bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory in both segments, particularly as the environment begins to normalize. Remaining relentless with our focus on growth, performance and people combined with the compounding impact of our continued growth investments and alignment with consumer trends underscores McCormick's position to deliver long-term differentiated growth. Our fundamentals remain strong and we expect to continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry leading pace. Importantly, I'd like to personally thank Lawrence for his mentorship and continued service to McCormick. On behalf of shareholders and employees, I want to recognize his outstanding leadership as CEO of this great company. Lawrence has been a transformational leader for McCormick, bringing our global flavor platform to life through his entrepreneurial spirit, innovated thinking, and growth oriented vision for company. During his time as CEO, we have grown sales over 50% and market capitalization more than doubled, creating significant shareholder value. We have prioritized investing to drive future growth, increase our profit realization, improved cash flow from operations and have returned more than $2.5 million to shareholders. Lawrence is widely credited with embedding purpose led performance into McCormick's culture by championing the company's industry-leading sustainability efforts, driving a period of tremendous growth, performance, and expansion, including acquisitions of iconic brands like Frank's RedHot, French's, Cholula, as well as FONA, and successfully leading McCormick through the unprecedented global pandemic. This is an enviable track record, congratulations, and we look forward to your continued support as Executive Chairman. Now for your questions. Well, thank you, Andrew. That's very kind of you to say that. Just to build on that from a regional perspective, Andrew. In the Americas, yes, we're performing pretty much as planned. I think you have to look at sort of volume and price together when we take a look at the profile. But we're showing sequential improvement across the portfolio, and that's been fairly consistent, sort of, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter so far. And we also need to recognize that in the second quarter result, it does include, kind of, the exit of this DSD business, which when you take that out, I think it kind of underscores the warrants is kind of broader view of what we think is going to kind of unfold in the back half. But it is broadly an improvement versus the first. China, we think we're going to have a strong recovery. Also, pretty confident in that, although it's a little bit less than just kind of a more gradual recovery than what we initially had planned for. So that's probably a little bit different than what we had been thinking about previously. But nevertheless, it is still a strong recovery. And I would say, in EMEA, we're pretty pleased with the performance on volume. And when you factor out the elements of Russia exit or overall, the underlying volume and mix when you exclude that was really actually pretty nice. So we're pleased to see that we have some volume growth despite those things in the EMEA region. On to the whole idea of this just to provide more color on this DSD exit, I would say that this is a business that we've been trying to kind of improve over time. And what we see from it is that this is -- the DSD portion that we delivered to store, we also have a warehouse and distribution delivery that we would handle. And that was a business that just simply wasn't profitable, and we decided we need to exit, but it was a meaningful chunk, I think, out of the second quarter, about 2 points. So as we transition away from that business, it will probably be an impact for the rest of the year, but something that we have planned for. Ken, thanks for the question. We're not experiencing anything unusual or significant trade inventory destocking. Honestly, there's really how much drama in the quarter for us on this. The difference between our sales and consumption was more attributable to just the retail sell-through of the discontinued items, and the point I just made regarding DSD is an example of that. But also, we have higher listing fees this quarter just due to the fact that we're launching more new products. And so I think you see that in lot of our dialogue in terms of Cholula or Grill Mates items for grilling or at Tabitha brown line, so we definitely had that. But as we anticipated, our alignment between consumption and shipments is normalizing. There's not really anything unusual going on in this quarter. Hey, Ken, on the Flavor Solutions side of our business in EMEA, definitely, it's been softer than what we would have expected, I think, mostly because we're just seeing a slowing of consumer demand from our customers. And that would be both, sort of, food and beverage and -- but I would say, it's most coming through the quick-serve restaurant customer channel. And that -- we think it's really more of a reflection of what we see happening and what's being reported, I think, in terms of overall inflationary impact in EMEA, specifically Europe. But definitely, as we kind of noted in the remarks leading into the call here, that is something that is probably more affecting our overall volume rate in the EMEA region. Thanks, Peter. Thanks for the question, Peter. We're off to a really good start on grilling for this summer season, and we definitely saw that as a good start in Q2. A lot of it's really driven by just -- if you think about we have a solid innovation plan, I think, for the grilling season, we're launching some new grilling items. Plus we're also in just really much healthier supply on mustard and Frank's RedHot. And these are areas in Lawry's marinades, where if we look at last year and before that, certainly we're coming on top of now a period of where we just have really full supply, assured supply for our customers, and we're turning back on normal promotional activity on the business. So we feel like all of those things put together, innovation, supply, getting back to the way you want to run a season on grilling, we have a really good start to the year. And as we look at it kind of from a share standpoint, we really probably performed quite well kicking off in the second quarter. So all those things come together, I think, for a great start to the summer season. Well, Alexia, thank you for the question on TDPs and overall distribution. First of all, I'd like to say, we continue to make really good progress year-to-date. And as we look at our performance and our trends and all the different metrics we might look at, we're happy to see that come through as a positive, especially in the second quarter. And we do expect to see continued progress as we go into the back half. We have some significant improvements that we know will start to come online just because as customers reset their shelves, and those things start to happen. A lot of the wins that we get through category management and all of that really important effort we put forth in terms of help the retailer guide the category. We know that there's going to be some helpful improvements coming through on that as we go to the back half. I'm reluctant to kind of quantify all that as we think about that into the back half of \u201823 and all the way into \u201824. But this is an effort, as we've said before, that we're going to continue to be working on over the course of not only this year, but also next year. And as we look at overall distribution, we know that we're not going to get all of that back in terms of rough points, because almost half of that was discontinuations originally. So we feel really good about our progress right now on an overall distribution points, and it should continue to improve as we go through \u201823 and also in \u201824. Steve, thanks for the question. As it relates to our Flavor Solutions business, when we look at overall, our volume mix profile on it, taking into account, sort of, the exit discussions that we've already had and other impacts, we think our volume profile right now reflects, kind of, the categories that we choose to really focus in on like performance nutrition and seasonings and health and nutrition. These are areas that we still see a lot of healthy growth in and those have been intentionally, kind of, area of growth and focus for us. And so I don't know that we're -- and I won't be able to comment specifically on any particular customer activity, but we believe our volume profile, kind of, reflects more of that composition of our business. And I'm not sure that we're seeing any broad restocking discussions that we have with customers at this point in time. Yes. Just like we've seen in our current trends, Max, the sequential sales unit, and volume improvement across the portfolio and even specifically within spices and extracts in Americas, we do think that reflects, kind of, those long-term tailwinds of our categories, but also our growth plans. So we continue to invest in brand marketing, really focused category management and innovation. And that allows us to kind of focus on those volumes and that sustainable growth, and also get that compounding effect of those investments. So yes, I do expect that profile to improve as we go through the back half. As you called out, reasonably the improvement in TDP, we should also then start to see an improvement overall as we think about dollar share. And so that is a reasonable thing I think to look out for. What is driving our performance right now and we think will, as we continue moving forward, is increased distribution, brand marketing, category management and innovation, and we also see a similar trend on this in Europe. So these are areas that we continue to put a lot of focus up against. And I would say our outlook is -- as everyone has said so far this morning, I guess, I'm going to say it, too. Everything is moving in the right direction. So we feel that same way about our external performance off shelf. I think, first of all, it's important to call out that our base case has been for the Consumer to be under pressure in 2023, and we expect that to kind of continue. And although broadly speaking, the Consumer has held up better-than-expected. Yet, there is still pressure out there. Having said that, though, as we look at our own price elasticities and performance off shelf, it remains pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, most recently. And so we're not seeing a big deviation from where we've been. And in fact, I would say we had a retail price increase come through in early April, and we still see very consistent trends with regard to price elasticity. We don't see any examples right now of it yet or planning to getting worse. But then also, I'm not sure that we're indicating so far that it's getting measurably better. But these are consistent trends that we're planning on for the rest of the year, because we are still on our base case of a pressured Consumer. Well, I think in terms of -- did we see a sequential improvement or any sequential changes as we went through the quarter? No, I would say that, largely, as we observed, kind of, the performance in the quarter in China, the one thing that was obvious is they're dealing with higher unemployment. And Consumer spending isn't as robust as maybe many and all of us were planning on, yet still being a strong rebound, but we weren't seeing any sort of different performance throughout the quarter, I would say, it was pretty much consistent. And our view, once we saw the quarter open up, it sort of held that way throughout the end of the second quarter. I think your question though -- in the back half of your question, maybe you meant on sort of how we're thinking about the third quarter. And recall last year though, that was a big rebound period in recovery with China in the third quarter. So we don't expect that same level of recovery in the third quarter this year just, because we're comparing up against that. But we expect those same trends to kind of flow through into the third quarter. And then again, when we get to the fourth, it's going to be different yet again. So we're going to be comparing against a very challenging period with respect to COVID lockdowns, et cetera. And so that is likely to feel more like the second quarter. Congratulations to you. Well, I mean, I think we have to acknowledge that there has been some trade down to private label, especially more recently. And -- but also, it has moderated, especially I think in our own categories, as we see more pricing on shelf coming from private label. Those gaps narrow, and so therefore, sort of, the unit growth and trends, sort of, decelerate and we're seeing our own unit trends show sequential improvement. But going back to sort of the idea of research and what consumers are telling us and what we're -- we keep finding and it keeps you reinforced with consumer feedback is they're looking for value, not necessarily the cheapest path of smaller items. And we do see consistently consumers do prefer brands. And a lot of what we've been trying to do when we think about just the mix between private label and brand recall, we're also in the private label business with our customers. So we see a role for private label in our categories. And so we are obviously supported from a category management standpoint that both provide a range of offerings for the consumer. Right now, we are pushing a lot on value. We're really focused on the growth of our line sizes. We're seeing consumer shift there more and more as they look for that greater value, and it's definitely showing through in our trends. But it's not dilutive to us or to the retailer. We're not seeing as many signs of trade down right now as maybe we saw during sort of the hype of this inflationary period that we've been going through. If I were to go back to over several years, a little bit harder to comment on category by category, but we typically see this happen during inflationary or recessionary times for private label. It certainly seems to -- appears to gain share. But then again, we're not hitting sort of the highs that are different from what we've seen in previous periods. So that's our perspective on it, but we are certainly, kind of, have our foot in both parts of the category. Thanks, Rob."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 12, our top line constant currency sales grew 10%, compared to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 11% from pricing, partially offset with a 1% volume and mix decline. As Lawrence already mentioned, there were impacts to volume related to the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of our consumer business in Russia, and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. At the total company level, all these impacts netted out. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased 7%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline. Including in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and our business exit in Russia, a 1% decline from exiting DSD or Direct Store Delivery business for our Hispanic bag products in the Americas. On slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, with an 8% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 2% volume decline from the Hispanic product DSD exit and 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Our strong underlying sales growth was driven by the products in our grilling portfolio, Brendan mentioned earlier. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9% with a 12% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline from exiting Russia and a 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all categories and markets. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 28% driven by a 20% volume increase from China recovery and a 6% increase from pricing actions across the entire region, as well as 2% increase in all other volume and product mix. Turning to our flavor solutions segment on slide 16, we grew second quarter constant currency sales 13%, reflecting a 14% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China offset by a 1% decline from discontinuing a private label food service product line in EMEA. In the Americas, flavor solutions, constant currency sales rose 11%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth and seasonings was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low margin business. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15% with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 2% impact from discontinuing the private label product line I mentioned earlier. EMEA's Flavor solutions outstanding growth was driven by pricing and was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. Volume and mix outside the product discontinuation declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses, mainly packaged food and beverage customers as well as QSRs. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor solution sales grew 22% in constant currency with a 13% volume benefit in China due to lapping the prior year COVID-related disruption, an 8% increase from pricing actions and a 1% increase in all other volume and mix driven by Australia. As seen on slide 20, gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period, reflecting our unwavering focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs. The continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the last two years as we planned, and favorable product mix in both segments. We offset current year inflation in the second quarter with our pricing. Notably, in flavor solutions, while we continue to incur some level of higher cost to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. We continue to make progress on reducing the level of these costs. And as we expected, the second quarter's dual running costs we experienced in the U.K. were comparable to last year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year. Now moving to slide 21, selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A increased relative to the second quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI lead and GOE savings. Brand marketing increased compared to the second quarter of last year and we are expecting an even more significant year-over-year increase in the third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 20 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher SG&A costs resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 36%, compared to the second quarter of 2022. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income increased 24% and the Flavor Solutions segment grew 66%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 22. Our interest expense increased significantly over the second quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3%, compared to 18.6% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 23, second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, as compared to $0.48 for the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. On slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was strong. $394 million in 2023, compared to $154 million for the first half of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory, as well as lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $209 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $119 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on slide 25. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance, as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact in the first-half of the year, and projected favorable impact in the second-half. For fiscal 2023, we are reaffirming our sales outlook and as Lawrence mentioned, we are raising adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by our strong year-to-date performance, combined with the robust demand we continue to expect and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure. At the top line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we have taken in 2023, we expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment, a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. And finally, the continual pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. We estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA Flavor Solution private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2022, compared to our prior guidance 25 basis points to 75 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI led and GOE programs and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged for the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 8% to 10% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 10% to 12%, compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low-single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI leg cost savings target of approximately $85 million. We continue to anticipate a meaningful step up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in the third quarter of 2023. The net impact of these interest related items is expected to be approximately 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 10% to 12% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items, I just mentioned impacting profit. The GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest, and tax headwind of 9%. This resulted in an expected increase of 3% to 5% or projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.60 to $2.65. Before turning it back to Brendan, I would like to recap the key takeaways I've seen on slide 27. Our second quarter sales growth reflects sustained demand across our business and the effective execution of our strategies. Our pricing actions are in place and our volume of performance improved. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our cost savings programs are yielding results in line with our expectations. Our year-to-date results combined with continued robust demand expectations and our actions to optimize our cost structure, bolster our confidence in delivering the strong operating performance projected in our enhanced 2023 outlook. I think too, just to add a little color on the volume there. About one-third of that decrease in volume is due to the exit of that private label, the two service lines. So again, another portfolio optimization. Yes. I mean, for the year, Peter, as you know, we did raise our guidance on gross margin, 25 basis points to 75 basis points to 50 basis points to 100 basis points. So we reflected some of the increased pricing realization we talked about in the call. We're really, really doing well in our GOE program and realizing those savings and those ramp up in the second-half. The thing about the second quarter, that 300 basis point improvement, second quarter last year was our worst performance of the year. You'll see improvements in the back half and basis points versus last year, but they won't be as big as the 300 we had in the second quarter. I mean, based on the mix of our business, generally, the back half does have higher margins, especially in the fourth quarter. Our implied guidance has high of almost 90 basis points improvement, lows 0s, so you get a little bit of a squeeze factor there. But if we continue to have success, and again, we see that ramp up in the second-half. China is going to have a really strong recovery in Q4, that's a positive for us. We have scale over there and have good margins. I guess, Lawrence said, everything is moving in the right direction. And then with our brand marketing, we're going to be mid-single-digit increase in the second half. A lot of that's going to go into the third quarter that are willing to support those plans. Okay. Let me think about that. So you're referring to -- we have dual running costs in our EMEA region, due to our new large facility over there. I feel -- I think, I'm pretty sure I said in the last call, we're around $20 million for this year, which is about the same as last year. We're still going to have some cost next year, because it's going to go into the first and second quarter, the transition, because these are large manufacturing facilities. So if I were winging it, I'd say half of that is going to go away, but I'm going to be off, depending on the exact timing. Yes, yes. We'll see a nice wrap into 2024 from that. A lot of our growth in flavor solutions comes from innovations too. And those are the things that really drive volume and margin in Flavor Solutions. Yes. I mean I'd say, one, we're very pleased with our margin progress. As we stated on the call, a lot of -- everything is moving in the right direction, the GOE program, portfolio optimization, things like that are helping both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side. Like I said in the last call, pre-pandemic, we were -- our Flavor Solutions margins were a little over 14%. We don't look at that as a ceiling, however. Longer term, with portfolio migration, we think we will go higher. Short term-wise, we have strong belief we'll get back to 14%. It's not going to be this year, but we're going to see sequential improvement. And quarter-to-quarter, there will be lumpiness based on run cost and good running cost, things like that. So -- but we had a really good second quarter. It was an easy comp, compared to Q2 of last year, but we're pretty bullish on Flavor Solutions' recovery. Yes. I mean what you have to remember, Max, is when you're pricing to cover costs over a multi-year time you're going to have a large dilution impact just due to the math. And we said before, I mean, that has been a large headwind last year, but I think we quantified in the 200 basis point to 300 basis point range as the margin line. We haven't talked about it much this year, but we're still having some of that. We will get that back over time as we said, through our CCI programs, more normal cost inflation in the future. So it's hard to compare the four years ago to gross margin at this point, but a lot of that is dilution, but we see an upward trajectory as we see in the second quarter. That's the important thing. What makes me really excited is even with over -- we're catching up on the pricing we've under recovered the last two years. Even with that, that is a negative dilution impact. Even with that, we're showing gross margin impact, a positive based on the GOE program or the CCI programs. So that really gives us confidence going forward. Yes. Like we said last call on SG&A, I mean, on incentive bill back, it's mostly in the second-half. But the second quarter, if you remember back to the second quarter of last year, it was really difficult quarter, as I mentioned before. So we were obviously making adjustments to incentive comp there. So some of that did come through in Q2, but the majority of it is second-half back loaded. As far as gross margin, I think -- just at a very high level, I mean, we talked a lot about gross margin on this call. We're optimistic, but prudent. I mean we've got a lot of things that are -- we're putting points on the board in the GOE program. Pricing -- I'd say pricing realization is going to be highest in the first quarter and second quarter it's going to ramp down. So that's a little bit of that. And we're still having low to mid-teen cost inflation that we haven't moved on, so that's coming down. But at the end of the day, from a gross margin perspective, we're going to show improvement. And again, we're being prudent. The gross margin change in the first-half, we were favorable, up 113 basis points to last year. The second-half guidance implies 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So we're showing improvement. Remember that second quarter last year, we had a really positive 300-some basis points increase in Q2. So that's a bit of why it's over 100 basis points in the first-half. But 50 basis points improvement, we're happy with that. Great, thanks. Yes. So maybe in summary, Q3 is a tough comparison on China, because it's a strong recovery last year. Q4 is an easier comparison because they were locked down in the fourth quarter last year."

Thank you for joining today's first quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President and COO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of these non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nLawrence Kurzius: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the start of the year. We delivered solid first quarter results that reflect strong demand and early results from our actions to increase our profit realization in 2023. Our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our global operating effectiveness, or GOE program, is yielding results with first quarter cost savings in line with our expectations. The progress we are making on gross margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our plan and our 2023 full year outlook. Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we drove 3% sales growth or 5% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong underlying business performance with an 11% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 3% decline in underlying volume and product mix, a planned 1% decline from in basics divestiture and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, and an expected 1% year-over-year volume decline from lower consumption due to COVID-related disruption in China, which we expect to see a return towards normal consumption trends in the coming quarters. Our underlying first quarter sales performance positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. Our growth in the first quarter was led by outstanding performance in our Flavor Solutions segment with positive momentum continuing in all three regions. In our Consumer segment, our underlying sales growth was led by the Americas region. Moving to profit. Our adjusted operating income was comparable to the first quarter of last year and in constant currency increased 2%. Higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate more than offset our adjusted operating income growth in the quarter, resulting in a 6% decline in adjusted earnings per share. I'd like to say a few words about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in his discussion of our adjusted operating income growth drivers in a few moments. We drove considerable improvement in our gross margin performance in the first quarter. Our gross margin reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. As we've said previously, in 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation our pricing previously lagged as well as offset current year inflation through our pricing actions and other levers. Our gross margin also reflects the result of our diligence in optimizing our cost through our GOE program. This is progressing as planned and remains a key focus. We expect the impact of our GOE program to scale up as the year progresses, and we remain on track to realize $75 million of cost savings in 2023, which we will take to the bottom line because of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs and to streamline our organization. We remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. It's still early, but our first quarter results speak for themselves, and we expect to continue driving profitable growth at an accelerated rate for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvement in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now let's move to first quarter business updates for each of our segments as well as discussion of our growth plans. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 6. Our underlying performance was strong, reflecting the effective execution of our pricing actions and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trend, even with lapping the elevated at-home consumption in the first quarter of 2022 due to Omicron in the Americas and the EMEA regions. That performance was partially offset by the impacts related to the sale of Kitchen Basics, our exit of Russia and the COVID-related disruption in China. Beginning in the second quarter, the activation of exciting growth initiatives, as well as lapping the impact of last year's COVID-related shutdowns in China and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, which we began to exit in the second quarter of last year, is expected to drive an acceleration of our consumer segment growth. Now for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 5% in line with our shipments. As we anticipated, the dynamics between consumption and retail inventory levels have begun to normalize as we move beyond the holiday season impact, and we anticipate greater alignment between consumption and shipments going forward. Importantly, our volume performance in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter on higher price realization. In spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters, with strength in our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration. Early results of our Lawry's everyday spice range, our largest innovation launch sense pre-pandemic, continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category. Over half of the purchases are from new virus to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. Hot sauce remains on fire with double-digit growth of both Cholula and Frank's RedHot in the U.S. and Canada. We continue to build excitement with our hot sauce brand marketing initiatives and reached the younger generation, most recently through gaming. And our big game campaign during the quarter, our flavor pack version of Fortnite, the Floor is Flavor, had players navigating an immersive chicken wing shaped island and a volcano that's put Frank's RedHot and included in partnership with TGI Fridays and DoorDash, a free chicken wings offer. This was our best big game campaign, capturing over 1 billion impressions in North America. And with the resolution of the long-running shortage of French's mustard bottles, we drove over 20% consumption growth for the second consecutive quarter. Our creamy muster launch last year continues to perform very well, with another flavor launch coming this year. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings, but we're realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. For instance, McCormick Corn seasonings and Frank's variety packs are both off to a great start following their online introductions earlier this year. In EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance of herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We're continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K. are building momentum with Cholula. We're driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. We're taking meaningful progress across the region and expanding our distribution and gaining share in the fast-growing discount channel. Our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proving to be effective in driving growth. In the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India, which we will have lapped after this quarter as well as the COVID-related disruptions in China. As we have moved past the Chinese New Year, we are seeing a return to normalization. We continue to expect a benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping the impact of last year's disruptions. Outside of the China and India impact, growth in the region was driven by new products and brand marketing initiatives. Frank's RedHot and Cholula performance was strong in Australia and extending the power of our brands, we have launched Old Bay into the Australian market and Cholula into Southeast Asia. As always, we continue to fuel our Consumer segment growth with the power of our brands as well as our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. We're excited about the growth plans we're executing and expect they will drive an acceleration of growth for the balance of the year. First, as we mentioned at CAGNY, we are completely renovating our U.S. core everyday spice of portfolio with consumer-preferred packaging as well as through leveraging new flavor seal technology. The atmosphere in the bottle is nitrogen flushed to remove oxygen, which means visibly fresher flavor, brighter color and stronger aroma. The modern new Snap-type trademark lid seals in the aroma and freshness. We're also printing the product names and an easy-to-read Best Buy date on the top. The new high-quality bottle and label design highlights the transparency and quality of our spices and herbs, and the bottle is made of 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, approximately a 20% carbon footprint reduction from the current package. We are really excited about these changes and so are consumers. Testing has confirmed 40% higher freshness per session, 2x higher preference and a 25% increase in loyalty among current buyers. The products began rolling out last month. The transition on store shelves will happen over the course of the year, supported with our highest spend brand marketing campaign of the past five years. Importantly, the new packaging fits right into the existing shelf stock. This is a seamless transition for our retail partners that we expect to drive category performance. This initiative, coupled with other new product introductions, I'll mention in a minute, along with our stabilized service levels, will build total distribution points and market share improvement as we go through the year as we outlined last month at CAGNY. We're also expanding into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with authentic Mexican flavor of Cholula in new formats. We are launching Cholula Taco recipe as well as sauces based on authentic Mexican formulas and crafted in Mexico using locally sourced fresh tomatoes and. Retail acceptance has been strong and consumers will find these new products and the authenticity they are looking for on U.S. shelves soon. Product began shipping yesterday ahead of, and the rollout will continue over the course of the second quarter. We're launching new products in the first half of 2023 to inspire consumers flavor exploration as well as the opinions consumers are looking for. In the Americas, we are kicking off the grilling season with new flavors including a Griller's Choice marinate you can use as three different flavors. And we're really excited about our new Stubs Master series made with technology from our FONA acquisition, these dry seasoning rubs capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor. Leveraging the product successes of 2022, we are extending our Tabitha brown line into new flavors, formats and channels, and we're also launching a French's creamy roasted garlic mustard. In direct-to-consumer, we continue to grow our platform with new innovative flavors as a testing ground and in the club channel, we're launching a world flavors line. In EMEA, we're enabling consumers to discover the authentic taste of America by introducing old Bay to the U.K. market as well as introducing a new line of products leveraging the French's brand, including American favorites recipe. In the U.K., we also just launched Schwartz brand gravy, which are beating the top competitor on taste. In APZ, we've recently launched meal basis, a favorite Keane's recipes and will be launching a Gourmet Garden SD lemon paste, both making consumers flavor exploration easier. In China, we've introduced new packaging for our Chicken Bullion product, a pouch with a resealable port cap that makes it convenient for consumers and extends the open product shelf life by locking up moisture. We're continuing to build our heat platform across all regions with the launch of new products, including in the U.S., Gourmet Nashville hot chicken season, Frank's RedHot Dill Pickle hot sauce and a Cholula reserve crafted with 100% tequila and our flavor forecast of the year, Vietnam's agent sale season. In China, we're introducing iconic Chinese city spicy blend and then the U.K. Frank's RedHot spicy recipe mixes. Across all regions, we're increasing our brand marketing investments in 2023 and expect the most significant year-over-year increase in the second quarter. We will continue to support our brands with messaging on everyday use, value and the superiority of our ingredients and flavors and more specifically, with mustard supply issues resolved, we've launched a flavor on campaign for mustard or elevating our mother of sauce, Cholula campaign to support the launch of the new format and capitalize on. And of course, with grilling season starting during the quarter, we plan to reach grillers with our just flame and flavor campaign. A robust growth plan gives us confidence in continuing to drive positive momentum. We believe they will all be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our flavor leadership in core categories. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9. Our sales performance in this segment continues to be outstanding. This was our eighth consecutive quarter with double-digit sales growth. Our first quarter growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions, which as we expected, accelerated versus previous quarters. Now for regional highlights. Our Americas first quarter strong sales growth was led by our Flavors product category. Within Flavors, snack seasoning growth was strong including volume growth related to new products and strengthen our customers' iconic products, partially fueled by their marketing as well as our improved ability to service our customers as we began to realize the benefit of the capacity we're bringing online. Flavors for Performance Nutrition and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new customers and new products. Volume was tempered in the quarter by the pruning of some low-margin business. The impact of a very cold December on the away-from-home part of our portfolio and lower volume of alcoholic beverage flavors due to what must have been a drier January than last year. In EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, which was led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the first quarter. Overall, our price realization nearly doubled versus last quarter. And in APC, we delivered solid volume growth in the markets outside of China, driven by demand from quick service restaurants, or QSRs, for our products to heat up their hot and spicy offerings. Overall, labor solutions demand has remained strong, particularly in certain parts of our business in our Americas and EMEA regions. As we continue to bring additional capacity online and reduce both supply chain pressure and the extraordinary cost to service our customers, we appreciate their patience and collaboration. We're continuing our positive sales growth momentum in Flavor solutions, and we're committed to restoring profitability in this segment, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We're confident we will achieve margin recovery. In our January earnings call, we set our price increases had just begun to catch up with the pace of inflation and we were beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing lag in the last two years. This is continuing at an even greater rates in the first quarter. And earlier, I discussed cost through our two lead program, which will contribute to the Flavor Solutions margin recovery. GOE will have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, we continue to focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio such as the flavor product category volume growth I mentioned a few minutes ago in the Americas region. Now I'm excited to share the growth plans we're executing on and expect will continue to drive our growth momentum. We continue to fuel our Flavor Solutions segment growth using our differentiation, including our culinary foundation, our unique and powerful consumer insights advantage, our proprietary technologies and our passion for providing our customers with a differentiated collaborative experience. While we cannot get too specific about product development, following a strong year of innovation in 2022, we carried a robust new product pipeline into 2023. As we mentioned at CAGNY, we are specifically targeting opportunities to grow in high-growth end markets. Applications such as savory snacks, alcoholic beverages and Performance Nutrition and have outpaced market growth and as I just shared, our robust growth momentum continued in the first quarter. As we expect it will the balance of the year, the capabilities we built for these categories are creating significant top line opportunities. The power of McCormick and FONA together continues to fuel greater opportunities for growth. This acquisition is exceeding our expectations. We're capitalizing on opportunities to increase our sales to existing customers by cross-selling across our more comprehensive product offering and target new customers. We're leveraging our global footprint and capabilities to drive future growth. We are currently in the process of expanding performance nutrition into Canada as well as localizing confectionery flavors in for our FONA customer. Finally, in branded foodservice, we have a robust 2023 innovation agenda, launching more than double the new items than in 2022, including Frank's RedHot, Nashville Hot, a line of Cholula Street Tacos, McCormick culinary Global blend and a French's portion control package. Our plans include continuing to leverage our culinary partnerships, inspire menu ideas with our customers, win placement on away-from-home menus, including with quick service restaurants and drive growth with promotional activities. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions also give us confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and drive our Flavor Solutions leadership. Now for summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we've intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its demand for great taste, with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. Through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth, we are end-to-end flavor. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies give us confidence in our growth momentum and ability to continue navigating the dynamic mobile environment. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth. We have robust growth plans in place including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with the successful execution of our planned and concrete actions we will drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. I want to also thank all of our customers, suppliers and investors for their collaboration and patients as we move beyond the unique environment we've been operating in since the onset of the pandemic. The fundamentals that drove our historical financial performance remain intact, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 14. Our top line constant currency sales grew 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 2% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the consumer business in Russia and lower consumption due to the COVID-related disruption in China. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased to 1%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline related to the Kitchen Basics, Russia and China impacts I just mentioned as well as a 5% decline in all other volume and product mix. On Slide 15, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, including a 2% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. Growth was broad-based across all product categories, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 2%. Pricing actions were more than fully offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from the lower sales in Russia. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 8%, driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by pricing actions. The combination of lower volume in China due to COVID-related disruptions and the exit of lower-margin business in India drove an 11% reduction in volume. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 18. We grew first quarter constant currency sales of 12%, reflecting a 13% increase from pricing actions and a 1% decline in volume and mix. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 12%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base, which skews to packaged food and beverage companies as well as branded foodservice customers. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth in snack seasonings and flavors for Performance Nutrition and health applications was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low-margin businesses and lower volume of away-from-home products as our customers' business was impacted by cold weather. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 17%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions outstanding growth was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. First quarter volume declined, driven primarily by softness in some of our packaged food and beverage customers volume within their own businesses. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined as the impact of scale back QSR activities in China due to COVID-related disruptions more than offset QSR volume growth outside of China. As seen on Slide 22, gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This is an improvement from our performance last year. While more work needs to be done, we are pleased with our progress and are confident in the actions underway to continue driving further improvement over the balance of the year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by several drivers. First, we're still incurring elevated costs in Flavor Solutions to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful in the short term, we know making these investments to support our customers is the right approach to driving long-term growth. That said, we continue to progress on reducing the level of these costs in the first quarter. Also in Flavor Solutions, we incurred dual running costs related to the transition to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. We expect the balance of the year costs to be comparable to 2022 and a sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments as compared to last year unfavorably impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings as well as the cost savings from our GOE program that Lawrence discussed, and which were in line with our expectations. Finally, end of note, we offset current year inflation in the first quarter, which we expect will be the highest of the year through our pricing actions. And as Lawrence said, we continue to recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as we planned. While the net of these impacts drives gross profit dollar growth, there is level of dilution that tempers the actual gross margin percentage. Now moving to Slide 23. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the first quarter of last year. Higher distribution costs were offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings as well as lower planned brand marketing and employee benefits expenses in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect both brand marketing and employee benefits expenses to be higher than last year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined 40 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. Higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, Consumer segment adjusted operating income increased 6%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 11%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 24. Our interest expense increased significantly over the first quarter of 2022, driven by the higher rate environment. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.63 for the year ago period. The decrease was due to higher interest expense and a higher first quarter adjusted effective tax rate. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $103 million compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $105 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow, driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. Now turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we project an unfavorable act in the first half of the year and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which are consistent with '22 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter, and finally, the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. Adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an even 100 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a further low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI cost savings target of approximately $85 million. We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense, driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be approximately an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook is to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with the continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. Our first quarter sales growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our underlying business performance was driven by our pricing actions and strong ongoing demand. Our first quarter progress on margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. We are committed to increasing our profit realization, and our actions are yielding results on optimizing our cost structure and recovering the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. We expect our progress to scale up as the year progresses. We have robust growth plans in place, including building momentum with product innovation and renovation and are driving improvement in our margin profile. We expect to drive profitable sales growth at an accelerated rate in the balance of the year and have bolstered confidence in delivering our outlook for 2023 in building shareholder value. The compounding benefit of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. Now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: I was just curious how 1Q came in versus your internal expectations. I guess, post in a broad sense, and maybe if anything specific stands out in terms of drivers. I won't ask if you considered raising guidance. I assume it's a little early in the year. But if the quarter was above what you would forecast, were there specific reasons that stand out. And I guess, is there any reason to think some of those drivers can't continue into 2Q and beyond maybe?\nLawrence Kurzius: Ken thanks. We are off to a solid start on the year. That is for sure. And we're really pleased with the start of the year. We had good sales growth and we made excellent progress on our plans for improved profit realization. Most of our team that we have planned for the years in place and our GOE program is beginning to show results. And as I said, we are bolstered in our confidence -- in our guidance, in part because the quarter did come in a little bit better than we planned. There's no one specific thing that stands out. But overall, it was a little bit better. We had a sense of that confidence already when we spoke at CAGNY. And -- from where we were at that time, it came in pretty much as we thought.\nMike Smith: And as you said, Ken, the first quarter to your March Madness, I think we put some points on the board, and we're going to continue focusing on growing the business. And as Lawrence said, we've made real good progress on our cost agenda to it, which is great.\nKen Goldman: Got it. And then sort of along the same lines, but maybe more specifically, Flavor Solutions volume, they were down slightly in the first quarter, but was our hardest comp of the year. It was high pricing. It seems that they're doing pretty well in the scheme of things. Just curious how to think about modeling volumes for Flavor Solution into and for the rest of the -- 2Q rather and for the rest of the year, just given that there may be a little more moving pieces than usual. You have that pricing. And then you guys mentioned some headwinds in 1Q, maybe some lower sales to CPGs in EMEA, for example. So I just wanted to get a sense of that kind of cadence as we go through the year as far as you can tell now.\nLawrence Kurzius: Sure. It was strong performance. In our guide for the year, we've said our volumes are going to be flattish overall. And I'd say our expectation by segment is maybe a little bit -- a little bit positive in Flavor Solutions, a little bit negative in the Consumer. But overall, all of it within kind of a plus or minus one range versus flat. And so I think that's a good way to think about it. We do expect to see strong pricing impact the year as we go through the whole year on Flavor Solutions.\nBrendan Foley: I would just -- Ken, just to maybe add a few thoughts to that. We did see volume strength in our portfolio, especially -- I think we called it out in the script of it just from snack seasoning on Performance Nutrition and Health, and that's pretty consistent with what we've been seeing, but the offsets really are not related to price elasticity. So I think that's maybe important to call out. And there was a couple of things noted like some cold weather impact on branded foodservice or we're certainly seeing an inflationary impact on our customer base and EMEA. They're going through a fair amount of inflation right now in that market, the consumer is. And just pruning of -- natural pruning of lower margin business. So, those are having an impact, too, on the volume profile. But I think our confidence still for the balance of the year is where Lawrence placed it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about what you're seeing evolve in terms of price gaps in core spices and seasonings versus private label, particularly with some of the incremental pricing that came into play sequentially in the first quarter.\nLawrence Kurzius: Brendan, why don't you take that?\nBrendan Foley: Andrew, we still see price gaps continuing to narrow compared to private label. That happened in Q4. We saw it again in Q1. It's really a result of seeing more private label taking price on the shelf. So that seems to be coming through and reading through the scanner data. And we would say and what we're seeing is that the impact just continues to moderate. Again, it's pretty consistent with what we saw in Q4. We really do believe a lot of our initiatives and a focus on value is also having a positive impact on our brands. And we continue this effort, whether it's messaging or focused on value sizes, et cetera. So that's also probably having an impact too. So that's really the nature of what we're seeing right now with regard to price gaps in private label.\nAndrew Lazar: And then you mentioned -- it's early, I know, but early results of sort of the Lawry's sort of value brand launches or kind of doing what you wanted to do. I think you said that over half of the purchases are from new buyers to McCormick. And then I think overall, incremental to the category. So I'm just trying to get a sense of where -- I guess, where are these new consumers to the category coming from where they just didn't operate in this category before? Or what is it about the Lawry's brand launch that's drawing, I guess, new consumers overall to the category because that's obviously particularly important, I guess, for your retail partners as well?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. It is performing better than we expected right now. And so we're pretty pleased with the performance. A lot of the volume that we are sourcing as we called out, it's definitely incremental to from a retailer standpoint, but also a lot of new brand buyers are coming into the McCormick franchise through Lawry's. I think its people seeking the brand. They're looking for value. And so, we see that playing out. And it's been largely positive as we think about building out even more distribution. These are some of the positive results that we're getting from this. It's just simply turning faster itself. But their -- Lawry's brand really is appealing to sort of a number of consumers. It's really strong with Hispanic households. It's strong with many other sort of demographic groups, and we see them coming into those stores being offered. They may not be buying then private label or they may not be buying in other retail outlets. So that's where we see a lot of the growth coming from in the incrementality. You're going to see more distribution growth on this, though, in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: First question is on China. You called out the fact that the China lockdowns and disruption over there pressured sales this quarter. Is that getting better? And what should we expect in Q2? And then I have a follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, of course, China was really complicated story this quarter because our first quarter begins in December. And in December, the country was still largely in lockdown -- now they got a train going behind the ground. The country is largely locked down in December, then they reopened and they had a very concentrated pandemic period or a huge proportion of the population. I wonder if you've lost -- but a question of the population got COVID. So that was quite a big impact on McCormick. We thought that post-Chinese New Year would probably begin to see a recovery. And I think we were seeing that unfold after Chinese New Year in a positive way. And in second quarter, we're going to lap the lockdowns from last year, and we're expecting a significant recovery in China. As we go through the second quarter, we're certainly going to have double-digit growth compared to a year ago unless there's some other exogenous shock. The question on that double digit is just what the first number is, but it's going to be big.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then...\nLawrence Kurzius: Brendon?\nBrendan Foley: No, I just think, Alexia, we're optimistic that this normalization will continue to unfold in the market. We expect to see much of that come through in Q2.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And sorry about the noise there. We've got some very impatient taxi drivers out here on the New York City street apparently. A quick follow-up. Inventory, retailer inventories were a big upset last quarter in terms of the year-on-year changes. Is that now behind us? And are you seeing any shifts, particularly in North America relative to the Nielsen data that we're seeing, consumer takeaway versus shipments?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I said that we thought that this would be behind us in the first quarter, and that's largely how it's played out.\nOperator: The next questions are from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: For modeling purposes, I wanted to know the phasing of the comparisons on your incentive comp. I couldn't quite tell in first quarter whether it was flat year-over-year? Or it was a -- and also for the rest of the year, it's a big number for the full year. Can you tell us how to think about it in the second and third...\nLawrence Kurzius: I'm going to let Mike go for this one.\nMike Smith: Yes. It was a relatively small favorable first quarter, but it will build during the year, as we said on the last conference call. So third and fourth quarter, second half will be significantly higher. That's why you'll see the impact.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. When you said favorable, so it was favorable in first...\nMike Smith: Last year. Yes, slightly unfavorable at first. But over the next three quarters, really the third and fourth and second half will be -- that's where you'll see the incrementality versus...\nRobert Moskow: Right, right, right. Okay. And I guess a similar question on China. I remember you called out an $0.11 per share impact in 2Q last year. So can I assume you're going to get all that back and more? And then in third, was there also an impact? It was never quantified, but it must be significant, too.\nLawrence Kurzius: We -- and actually because of the second fourth quarter negative impact, we had a big negative impact in the second quarter and then had a reopening, solid third quarter and then a re-lockdown in the fourth quarter. We're just part of our miss in the fourth quarter. You had no idea that was going to happen when we gave guidance. I think our full year guide for the order of magnitude that you're talking about...\nMike Smith: Yes. If you look at that the 2023 outlook chart in our earnings deck, a 3% impact on EPS, that's the full year impact, which is around...\nRobert Moskow: Sure. Okay. But it's really 2Q and 4Q that are the real comparisons?\nMike Smith: Yes. Those are the -- exactly. Yes.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Last question. Have -- do you think your sales force will get some more momentum regaining shelf space that they lost in 2022 as a result of the packaging redesign? Is that kind of a good way to get in with retailers to regain some of the SKUs that were cut? Or is it kind of two separate discussions?\nLawrence Kurzius: I think that absolutely, there is a tremendous opportunity for our sales force this year for a couple of reasons. One is that our service is in much better condition so that we don't have as many unproductive conversations with our customers. The second is the sheer amount of innovation and the balance that we're bringing to our customers is going to be really positive. And Brendan, I'm going to ask you to just say a few words about that.\nBrendan Foley: Yes. It isn't -- as we would always say, Rob, it's never just one thing, it's a system of things, and that really drive that competitive strength, and that applies, I think, to your question as well. Yes, we have a big renovation plan as you called out, and that's definitely going to be a big lever. And I think it's all about driving and improving the category. And so our sales organization certainly is kind of selling behind the strength of story. We'll continue to reclaim distribution points, not only over this year, but also over next year. That's part of the process of doing this. But as Lawrence called out, I just think our innovation platform is going to continue building also additional distribution points. We really like our innovation platform and the items that we're coming out with this year. So, we expect to see a lot from that too. And all of these things put together with a very, very strong levels of brand marketing, brings together a really strong category conversation with the retailer. I think importantly, though, we keep pointing out the performance of McCormick and our other brands on shelf just continues to sort of outperform competition. And so those are some of the things that we use in category management to really prove the case that it's a more productive shelf, the more McCormick guidance you have on it.\nMike Smith: And I think supporting those new products in our brand marketing, we were slightly favorable in the first quarter versus last year, but you'll see in the second quarter that support will increase year-on-year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Max Gimport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: For the question. First one is on gross margin. So it came in well above Street expectations in the quarter. And I recognize it's early and you talked about putting points on the board. But I do wonder that as you think about your path to mitigating the pressure points that impacted this line last year, have your used changed at all? It would seem like with inflation accepted to ramp down through the year and your GOE program as to ramp up through the year, you might now have a bit more visibility towards the higher end of your previous 25 to 75 basis point guidance range.\nMike Smith: Again, this is the first quarter. The first quarter results though do really give us -- they bolster our confidence, as Lawrence said, the pricing realization, recovering those costs we've had and, frankly, over recovering in the year, which gives us more confidence, the GEO program, the implementation of those programs, which are very programmatic in nature gives us more confidence. But before we start celebrating, we want to, again, put points on the board in the second quarter. I will note, consumer margins, operating profit margin, up 110 basis points in the first quarter. We're really happy with that. And while Flavor Solutions is still negative, it was about 200 basis points less than that last year. There was a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, and we're really focused on driving those margins higher this year.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I think you'll see as we go through the year, that we will steadily improve that flavor solution margin performance. But as Mike said, this is our first quarter, it's also the smallest quarter of the year. We certainly bolstered in our confidence, but we don't want to get overconfident.\nMax Gumport: Great. Makes sense. And then on the GOE program, is there a number you're giving for the first quarter? I realize it's $75 million for the year, but just curious if you can get in for what occurred?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean basically, like two months ago, we said it's a small impact on first building into the second then in the second half is where you see the significant impact it scales up.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Just going back maybe to the question on trade inventory that I think Alexia originally raised. Just to play it back, it seems like from what you had said before that you exited the quarter with trade inventory levels roughly in balance from the consumer business. Just want to make sure that was correct. And then so as we go forward, I guess the base case is that you ship more or less to consumption for the balance of the year with maybe a little bit of opportunity to ship ahead to the sense that the renovation work leads to those incremental distribution points. Is that the right interpretation of what you said so far?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I think if I took the question mark of replacement, we have the answer. But Brendan, do you want to comment on that?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. I mean maybe, Steve, just to focus on the front end of your question first. What we saw in the first quarter, we did -- shipments were in line with consumption. But I think more importantly, the dynamics that we would typically see in the first quarter following a holiday season played out as it behave much like a normal period of time. So that's what we'd hope to see in Q1. That's what we did see in Q1. And what that, I think, means looking ahead now, which is kind of the back end of your question is we see things normalizing and operating a little bit more like we would typically operate. I have to think a little bit of what that means by the end of the year, but we would just see a shift to consumption model really play out as we normally do. Just remember, though, in that fourth quarter, we have a big -- that's our biggest quarter of the year, in our big holiday season. So we tend to kind of even things out after Q1 and then sort of like begins again as we think about that cycle. So that's the way I would think about it. But the important takeaway for me and I think maybe in this call is that we saw a normalization of that, how that would typically behave in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: So, I guess I wanted to come back to Flavor Solutions. And I think the comments in response to earlier question was kind of expect to see the margins there build through the year. And that's also, I think, where the majority of the global operating effectiveness program would show up. Can you just remind us this year, kind of the excess costs that you're carrying for the U.K. facility as you execute the changeover to the new plant, and we think about that layering out of the system in '24 and beyond? And maybe more broadly, help us think about the road map to building the Flavor Solutions margins back up to the mid-teens level that they were at pre-COVID?\nMike Smith: Yes. I mean we're roughly comparable on the little bar facility the last year, as we said, I mean, in...\nLawrence Kurzius: After this quarter.\nMike Smith: After this quarter, but into next year, there's still going to be some carryover into next year. So I almost hesitate to say a number right now. Overall, we've said before around $20 million of kind of dual running costs on an annual basis. So a good chunk of that should go away next year. But again, that depends on there's a lot of factors relating into that. But if you think about this year with Flavor Solutions, the first quarter is one of the highest commodity and other costs were and that will -- just like on the consumer side of the business, that will go down the rest of the year. Pricing realization will support that. Then the GOE business -- the GOE program, and that really benefits both of our segments too. I wouldn't say all of us going to Flavor Solutions. It's really across the board where we've had inefficiencies that have built up in the system since the pre-pandemic. We've called out some of those very clear examples of Flavor Solutions like Topak and things like\nAdam Samuelson: And I guess then as we think about kind of exiting this year on Flavor Solutions and beyond, I mean you're still kind of -- the margin structure of the business seem to be well below where you were a couple of years ago. And just trying to think about kind of some of the building blocks, whether it's, say, concentrated customer base and getting kind of the full price recovery there? Is it mix? Is it capacity? I'm just trying to think about what -- where the margins have gotten to in 2018, 2019. And exiting this year, they're still going to be in kind of high single-digit range, I think.\nMike Smith: We think we have a long runway of improvement Flavor Solutions margins. You refer back '18 and '19. I mean our margins are 14-ish range, and we feel we can get back there over time as we over -- we recover those costs, we've talked about as costs moderate as we get more efficient. So we don't see 2019 as really the ceiling. And our portfolio -- the pruning portfolio driving more towards the higher-margin products as we -- you've seen accelerated growth there we talked about today. So, we do -- but it's not going to happen snap your fingers by the end of this year. This is a program that is going to play out over the next couple of years.\nAdam Samuelson: Well, I get that's not going to happen just this year, but if I just push in -- the business mix isn't all that different today versus where it was three or four years ago. So apart from we've had this big run of inflation, what's really changed in terms of the profitability of the portfolio today?\nMike Smith: Well, I mean the three things we said in the last earnings call, where the significant inflation and we're recovering that inflation now through incremental pricing. The significant incremental costs we've incurred since pre-COVID, we're addressing them through the GOE program across both segments and the incremental cost for driving additional capacities as an example, a little of our investment. So, those three things have really driven that operating profit degradation, which we are in the process of now reversing.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I would say that it's not true that the business mix has not changed. The business mix has changed, and we continue our portfolio migration towards more value-added products. You hear us talking about pruning the portfolio. We have not been specific because we don't want to talk about things that are -- that might be identifiable to a specific customer, but there's definitely been a movement within our portfolio, both by category and within product categories to improve that business for the long term. And Mike said that we don't look at the pre-pandemic operating margin as a ceiling. As we said at the time, we look to some of our pure labor house peers who publish public numbers who have significantly higher operating margins. That's more what we aspire to in the very long run.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Mike, just to go back to the question around kind of GOE and to square some of the gross margin kind of math on the quarter. It seemed like you were saying GOE was pretty minimal in terms of contribution to gross in 1Q. But maybe you can just help us like the other components, what did CCI contribute in 1Q? And just where did the actual inflation rate -- the COGS inflation rate in the quarter fall relative to that low to mid-teens number for the year?\nMike Smith: Well, we've said, I mean, the first quarter is the highest of our inflation rates turned out to be that way, and it will go down the rest of the year sequentially. GOE was a small impact as you referred to. CCI roughly, is really spread throughout the year. So we don't get really specific around what CCI occurs because it's a continuous program. So you have every quarter. It's approximately the same level as last year or slightly higher, depending on your guidance. We said that this year is $85 million. Last year, it was $85 million, so probably roughly the same. But I think as you think about the margin improvement, the pricing realization that we've seen -- as you've seen in our numbers, is really driving a good chunk of that. So that's what gives us confidence on the rest of the year too. We're recovering these costs. We said that we incurred the last couple of years. We're catching up this year, and you've seen that in the first quarter.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. That's helpful. And Lawrence, maybe just -- you talked a little bit about drilling season and some of the new product innovation. We've heard from some others as well. Just curious how you're thinking about promotional maybe cadence over some of the summer holidays, if that's maybe the depths aren't back to a more normal level. But are you seeing a chance to maybe increase promotional frequency as you get into some of your bigger, more important holiday season?\nLawrence Kurzius: Actually, I would say that with our higher -- with our improved service levels, I'd say, our promotional levels have also normalized. Now we were able to support promotional volumes now. The promotions that we run tend to be ROI positive. I think that's an important part of building back market share that we didn't talk about actually in making our points and I'm glad you asked the question. But sometimes promotion is thought of as dealing back price has not what we're talking about. We're talking about quality merchandising events that drive consumer takeaway. We're going to over a little bit over time, but we're going to take everybody's question. So hope they're not too long.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nCody Ross: I just wanted to hit back on the last question as it related to your volume expectations for the quarter. How do you think about promotions for the rest of the year, especially in terms of what your competitors are doing? Are you seeing promotions increase? And then as it's related, how did your volume come in, in the quarter relative to your expectations?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, as I said, I think our -- our ability to full schedule of merchandising activity with our customers. I think that's part of what gives us confidence in our outlook for the year, frankly, is that we're able to have those kinds of positive conversations with our customers as opposed to some of the negative ones that we might have been having over the last few years about supply and their desire to promote. I mean, I think some great examples are like our French mustard where we finally have bottles in supply, and we've been able to drive 20% volume growth for the last two quarters and gained significant share. And I think that we're going to do a similar thing with growing products. I think the renewal of our ability to meet our core product demand is also allowed us to innovate. And so those promotions, in many cases, are showcasing our products in store, which also, I think, will contribute to volume. And again, our outlook for volume on the Consumer side of the business relatively flat for the year, I think we're up against a tough comparison in the first quarter, and that's part of the reason why volume is down lapping Omicron a year ago and so on. But I think we're pretty optimistic actually on volume. And the pricing actions that we needed to take are loaded to the year. And again, so I think that, that's something that will -- it's not in the way of growing our volume.\nCody Ross: And then just one last question, more on capital allocation. Your leverage stands above 4x. You called that out as a reason why interest expense is moving higher this year. Historically, share repurchases have not been a big use of cash. Just given the difficult operating environment in the credit markets right now, can you share with us how you think about prioritizing debt pay down versus M&A? And then in that context, can you also update us on what the M&A pipeline looks like right now?\nLawrence Kurzius: It's always dangerous when the CEO talks about capital allocation, so I'll let Mike give us the talking here. The one thing I'll say about M&A is it's not our priority right now, but we would not miss a good strategic opportunity.\nMike Smith: Yes. And I'd say like we've said, both at CAGNY and probably in the earnings -- last earnings call two months ago, I mean our priorities right now is paying down debt, generating more cash, getting our debt-to-EBITDA back down to 3x by the end of 2024. So really nothing has changed from that. And we continue -- as Lawrence said, we continue to look at great assets along the way, but our priority right now is paying down debt.\nOperator: Our final question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: I guess just the first question on the top line. Simplistically, you said, obviously, there's some expected tailwinds coming from China as we get through Q2 and lap some Omicron pressure, et cetera. Just in terms of that kind of expected acceleration, is that fairly similar in Consumer relative to Flavor Solutions just obviously because you have a little bit of a clearly an easier compare on the volume side in Consumer? And then secondly, just kind of any perspective as to -- it seems like you've been able to take a little bit more incremental pricing in Flavor Solutions versus Consumer? And maybe just why that is? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nLawrence Kurzius: Brendan, why don't you take?\nBrendan Foley: Yes, I would take. It's Rob, as we take a look at kind of the profile that you see in the first quarter, I think that's probably a profile largely that you'll see carried out through the rest of the year. As Mike and Lawrence have said a couple of times, we expect volume to be kind of in that plus or minus to 4% range. So, there's effectively more pricing in Flavor Solutions as a result of kind of the inflation profile that we've talked about. So that should provide, I think, a little bit of indication as to how we think about sort of the balance between Flavor Solutions and Consumer on the sales line. Having said that, we expect continued underlying strength as we go throughout the year in our Consumer business too, but the profile that you see in Q1, I think it tends to move forward that way throughout the rest of the quarters.\nLawrence Kurzius: And I'm going to say that on the Consumer side, we have tremendous growth plans, including a lot of innovation and the renovation of our everyday spice line, hitting the market in the second quarter and a number of major customer wins that are going to go on shelf in the third quarter. And we're expecting a strong recovery in China in the second quarter. So while it's a dynamic and that we are actually really encouraged about the sales outlook for the rest of the year.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Super. And then I guess maybe more for you, Lawrence, kind of some questions asked already just around kind of the mix of the business. How you're thinking about price gaps and private label in the U.S.? We've heard from a number of companies over the past couple of years that we've seen actions taken to potentially divest certain pieces of the business to kind of reduce overall private label exposure. Clearly, you would not be divesting your U.S. spices and herbs business, right?\nLawrence Kurzius: That's not our...\nRob Dickerson: Yes. Well, probability. But I am curious, just kind of given your commentary on product pruning and lower-margin businesses and then this innovation slate you have, I mean there still is some innovation kind of coming in the core space easing business. But when I look at like Cholula and look at Red Frank's, it would seem like there's a little bit higher share in those brands, better market penetration potential, maybe less private label exposure. So as you think of those innovation plans on a go forward as it also relates back to the overall mix of the business, would you say it's kind of part of the internal plan to be pushing on that part of the business, maybe more on the innovation side relative to, let's say, like special organic pepper?\nLawrence Kurzius: Well, I will say that, that is a wide-ranging question, and I can go absolutely while answering it. However, we have gotten rid of some -- when I say when we said we're pruning the business, I mean, some of it is not visible, as we talked about on a previous question. But some of it is Kitchen Basics, for example, is a brand that -- well, it's a great brand. We like it a lot. It was the only thing we had in that aisle. It was hard for us to bring our category management tools to bear on it and it was a little bit of an orphan. There was pressure both from leading brands and from private label on that. And we didn't see a good path to grow it with a good return for us, the wrong owner of that brand. And so we've thought about other parts of our portfolio that way. The things that we've gotten out of have tended to be pretty small, though. And that's a good example of one of the bigger things that we've done. Most of what we -- the other things we've gotten out of have been small or would be less familiar to you because they're in a different region of the world. But the innovation that we will do is differentiated. It brings more differentiation to our brand, flavors, blends that are hard to duplicate. We brought on a technology into some of our innovation as we have with the true taste technology that we are using in our new stubs rugs. And I think we just had a tough act to follow. And the renovation that we're doing on our core herbs and spice brands is going to be very differentiating, not just versus private label, but versus other brands. I mean to be able to have that oxygen-free atmosphere that is going to bring freshness to the market and a better appearance and aroma for consumers, that is going to be very differentiating and difficult to follow quickly. That's for sure. And a lot of the things that we're doing around that renovation are either trademarked or patented. And I think -- I mean, I think that everything you look at, whether it's the pruning of our portfolio or the migration of our portfolio to higher value or technically insulated products on the Flavor side, to the innovation that we're bringing in our brands, serves to differentiate us, extend our leadership and push the gap between us and private label to be more of a discussion around total value and cost and benefits than just about the cheapest price.\nBrendan Foley: And we really love the categories we're in, whether it's or Frank's RedHot, things like that. So, it's -- we've intentionally picked these categories.\nLawrence Kurzius: Thanks for your question. And that is our final question. So, I was waiting for the moderator to possibly say something, but that's okay. It's not necessary. But core alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for Flavor in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We are disciplined and our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nKasey Jenkins: Thank you, Lawrence, and thank you to everybody for joining today's call. If you have any other questions, please follow-up. Please feel free to contact me. This concludes this earnings call. Thank you all, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Lawrence Kurzius",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the start of the year. We delivered solid first quarter results that reflect strong demand and early results from our actions to increase our profit realization in 2023. Our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our global operating effectiveness, or GOE program, is yielding results with first quarter cost savings in line with our expectations. The progress we are making on gross margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our plan and our 2023 full year outlook. Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we drove 3% sales growth or 5% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong underlying business performance with an 11% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 3% decline in underlying volume and product mix, a planned 1% decline from in basics divestiture and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, and an expected 1% year-over-year volume decline from lower consumption due to COVID-related disruption in China, which we expect to see a return towards normal consumption trends in the coming quarters. Our underlying first quarter sales performance positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. Our growth in the first quarter was led by outstanding performance in our Flavor Solutions segment with positive momentum continuing in all three regions. In our Consumer segment, our underlying sales growth was led by the Americas region. Moving to profit. Our adjusted operating income was comparable to the first quarter of last year and in constant currency increased 2%. Higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate more than offset our adjusted operating income growth in the quarter, resulting in a 6% decline in adjusted earnings per share. I'd like to say a few words about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in his discussion of our adjusted operating income growth drivers in a few moments. We drove considerable improvement in our gross margin performance in the first quarter. Our gross margin reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. As we've said previously, in 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation our pricing previously lagged as well as offset current year inflation through our pricing actions and other levers. Our gross margin also reflects the result of our diligence in optimizing our cost through our GOE program. This is progressing as planned and remains a key focus. We expect the impact of our GOE program to scale up as the year progresses, and we remain on track to realize $75 million of cost savings in 2023, which we will take to the bottom line because of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs and to streamline our organization. We remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. It's still early, but our first quarter results speak for themselves, and we expect to continue driving profitable growth at an accelerated rate for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvement in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now let's move to first quarter business updates for each of our segments as well as discussion of our growth plans. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 6. Our underlying performance was strong, reflecting the effective execution of our pricing actions and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trend, even with lapping the elevated at-home consumption in the first quarter of 2022 due to Omicron in the Americas and the EMEA regions. That performance was partially offset by the impacts related to the sale of Kitchen Basics, our exit of Russia and the COVID-related disruption in China. Beginning in the second quarter, the activation of exciting growth initiatives, as well as lapping the impact of last year's COVID-related shutdowns in China and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, which we began to exit in the second quarter of last year, is expected to drive an acceleration of our consumer segment growth. Now for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 5% in line with our shipments. As we anticipated, the dynamics between consumption and retail inventory levels have begun to normalize as we move beyond the holiday season impact, and we anticipate greater alignment between consumption and shipments going forward. Importantly, our volume performance in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter on higher price realization. In spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters, with strength in our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration. Early results of our Lawry's everyday spice range, our largest innovation launch sense pre-pandemic, continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category. Over half of the purchases are from new virus to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. Hot sauce remains on fire with double-digit growth of both Cholula and Frank's RedHot in the U.S. and Canada. We continue to build excitement with our hot sauce brand marketing initiatives and reached the younger generation, most recently through gaming. And our big game campaign during the quarter, our flavor pack version of Fortnite, the Floor is Flavor, had players navigating an immersive chicken wing shaped island and a volcano that's put Frank's RedHot and included in partnership with TGI Fridays and DoorDash, a free chicken wings offer. This was our best big game campaign, capturing over 1 billion impressions in North America. And with the resolution of the long-running shortage of French's mustard bottles, we drove over 20% consumption growth for the second consecutive quarter. Our creamy muster launch last year continues to perform very well, with another flavor launch coming this year. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings, but we're realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. For instance, McCormick Corn seasonings and Frank's variety packs are both off to a great start following their online introductions earlier this year. In EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance of herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We're continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K. are building momentum with Cholula. We're driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. We're taking meaningful progress across the region and expanding our distribution and gaining share in the fast-growing discount channel. Our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proving to be effective in driving growth. In the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India, which we will have lapped after this quarter as well as the COVID-related disruptions in China. As we have moved past the Chinese New Year, we are seeing a return to normalization. We continue to expect a benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping the impact of last year's disruptions. Outside of the China and India impact, growth in the region was driven by new products and brand marketing initiatives. Frank's RedHot and Cholula performance was strong in Australia and extending the power of our brands, we have launched Old Bay into the Australian market and Cholula into Southeast Asia. As always, we continue to fuel our Consumer segment growth with the power of our brands as well as our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. We're excited about the growth plans we're executing and expect they will drive an acceleration of growth for the balance of the year. First, as we mentioned at CAGNY, we are completely renovating our U.S. core everyday spice of portfolio with consumer-preferred packaging as well as through leveraging new flavor seal technology. The atmosphere in the bottle is nitrogen flushed to remove oxygen, which means visibly fresher flavor, brighter color and stronger aroma. The modern new Snap-type trademark lid seals in the aroma and freshness. We're also printing the product names and an easy-to-read Best Buy date on the top. The new high-quality bottle and label design highlights the transparency and quality of our spices and herbs, and the bottle is made of 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, approximately a 20% carbon footprint reduction from the current package. We are really excited about these changes and so are consumers. Testing has confirmed 40% higher freshness per session, 2x higher preference and a 25% increase in loyalty among current buyers. The products began rolling out last month. The transition on store shelves will happen over the course of the year, supported with our highest spend brand marketing campaign of the past five years. Importantly, the new packaging fits right into the existing shelf stock. This is a seamless transition for our retail partners that we expect to drive category performance. This initiative, coupled with other new product introductions, I'll mention in a minute, along with our stabilized service levels, will build total distribution points and market share improvement as we go through the year as we outlined last month at CAGNY. We're also expanding into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with authentic Mexican flavor of Cholula in new formats. We are launching Cholula Taco recipe as well as sauces based on authentic Mexican formulas and crafted in Mexico using locally sourced fresh tomatoes and. Retail acceptance has been strong and consumers will find these new products and the authenticity they are looking for on U.S. shelves soon. Product began shipping yesterday ahead of, and the rollout will continue over the course of the second quarter. We're launching new products in the first half of 2023 to inspire consumers flavor exploration as well as the opinions consumers are looking for. In the Americas, we are kicking off the grilling season with new flavors including a Griller's Choice marinate you can use as three different flavors. And we're really excited about our new Stubs Master series made with technology from our FONA acquisition, these dry seasoning rubs capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor. Leveraging the product successes of 2022, we are extending our Tabitha brown line into new flavors, formats and channels, and we're also launching a French's creamy roasted garlic mustard. In direct-to-consumer, we continue to grow our platform with new innovative flavors as a testing ground and in the club channel, we're launching a world flavors line. In EMEA, we're enabling consumers to discover the authentic taste of America by introducing old Bay to the U.K. market as well as introducing a new line of products leveraging the French's brand, including American favorites recipe. In the U.K., we also just launched Schwartz brand gravy, which are beating the top competitor on taste. In APZ, we've recently launched meal basis, a favorite Keane's recipes and will be launching a Gourmet Garden SD lemon paste, both making consumers flavor exploration easier. In China, we've introduced new packaging for our Chicken Bullion product, a pouch with a resealable port cap that makes it convenient for consumers and extends the open product shelf life by locking up moisture. We're continuing to build our heat platform across all regions with the launch of new products, including in the U.S., Gourmet Nashville hot chicken season, Frank's RedHot Dill Pickle hot sauce and a Cholula reserve crafted with 100% tequila and our flavor forecast of the year, Vietnam's agent sale season. In China, we're introducing iconic Chinese city spicy blend and then the U.K. Frank's RedHot spicy recipe mixes. Across all regions, we're increasing our brand marketing investments in 2023 and expect the most significant year-over-year increase in the second quarter. We will continue to support our brands with messaging on everyday use, value and the superiority of our ingredients and flavors and more specifically, with mustard supply issues resolved, we've launched a flavor on campaign for mustard or elevating our mother of sauce, Cholula campaign to support the launch of the new format and capitalize on. And of course, with grilling season starting during the quarter, we plan to reach grillers with our just flame and flavor campaign. A robust growth plan gives us confidence in continuing to drive positive momentum. We believe they will all be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our flavor leadership in core categories. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9. Our sales performance in this segment continues to be outstanding. This was our eighth consecutive quarter with double-digit sales growth. Our first quarter growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions, which as we expected, accelerated versus previous quarters. Now for regional highlights. Our Americas first quarter strong sales growth was led by our Flavors product category. Within Flavors, snack seasoning growth was strong including volume growth related to new products and strengthen our customers' iconic products, partially fueled by their marketing as well as our improved ability to service our customers as we began to realize the benefit of the capacity we're bringing online. Flavors for Performance Nutrition and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new customers and new products. Volume was tempered in the quarter by the pruning of some low-margin business. The impact of a very cold December on the away-from-home part of our portfolio and lower volume of alcoholic beverage flavors due to what must have been a drier January than last year. In EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, which was led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the first quarter. Overall, our price realization nearly doubled versus last quarter. And in APC, we delivered solid volume growth in the markets outside of China, driven by demand from quick service restaurants, or QSRs, for our products to heat up their hot and spicy offerings. Overall, labor solutions demand has remained strong, particularly in certain parts of our business in our Americas and EMEA regions. As we continue to bring additional capacity online and reduce both supply chain pressure and the extraordinary cost to service our customers, we appreciate their patience and collaboration. We're continuing our positive sales growth momentum in Flavor solutions, and we're committed to restoring profitability in this segment, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We're confident we will achieve margin recovery. In our January earnings call, we set our price increases had just begun to catch up with the pace of inflation and we were beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing lag in the last two years. This is continuing at an even greater rates in the first quarter. And earlier, I discussed cost through our two lead program, which will contribute to the Flavor Solutions margin recovery. GOE will have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, we continue to focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio such as the flavor product category volume growth I mentioned a few minutes ago in the Americas region. Now I'm excited to share the growth plans we're executing on and expect will continue to drive our growth momentum. We continue to fuel our Flavor Solutions segment growth using our differentiation, including our culinary foundation, our unique and powerful consumer insights advantage, our proprietary technologies and our passion for providing our customers with a differentiated collaborative experience. While we cannot get too specific about product development, following a strong year of innovation in 2022, we carried a robust new product pipeline into 2023. As we mentioned at CAGNY, we are specifically targeting opportunities to grow in high-growth end markets. Applications such as savory snacks, alcoholic beverages and Performance Nutrition and have outpaced market growth and as I just shared, our robust growth momentum continued in the first quarter. As we expect it will the balance of the year, the capabilities we built for these categories are creating significant top line opportunities. The power of McCormick and FONA together continues to fuel greater opportunities for growth. This acquisition is exceeding our expectations. We're capitalizing on opportunities to increase our sales to existing customers by cross-selling across our more comprehensive product offering and target new customers. We're leveraging our global footprint and capabilities to drive future growth. We are currently in the process of expanding performance nutrition into Canada as well as localizing confectionery flavors in for our FONA customer. Finally, in branded foodservice, we have a robust 2023 innovation agenda, launching more than double the new items than in 2022, including Frank's RedHot, Nashville Hot, a line of Cholula Street Tacos, McCormick culinary Global blend and a French's portion control package. Our plans include continuing to leverage our culinary partnerships, inspire menu ideas with our customers, win placement on away-from-home menus, including with quick service restaurants and drive growth with promotional activities. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions also give us confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and drive our Flavor Solutions leadership. Now for summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we've intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its demand for great taste, with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. Through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth, we are end-to-end flavor. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies give us confidence in our growth momentum and ability to continue navigating the dynamic mobile environment. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth. We have robust growth plans in place including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with the successful execution of our planned and concrete actions we will drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. I want to also thank all of our customers, suppliers and investors for their collaboration and patients as we move beyond the unique environment we've been operating in since the onset of the pandemic. The fundamentals that drove our historical financial performance remain intact, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. Our first quarter sales growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our underlying business performance was driven by our pricing actions and strong ongoing demand. Our first quarter progress on margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. We are committed to increasing our profit realization, and our actions are yielding results on optimizing our cost structure and recovering the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. We expect our progress to scale up as the year progresses. We have robust growth plans in place, including building momentum with product innovation and renovation and are driving improvement in our margin profile. We expect to drive profitable sales growth at an accelerated rate in the balance of the year and have bolstered confidence in delivering our outlook for 2023 in building shareholder value. The compounding benefit of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. Now for your questions. Ken thanks. We are off to a solid start on the year. That is for sure. And we're really pleased with the start of the year. We had good sales growth and we made excellent progress on our plans for improved profit realization. Most of our team that we have planned for the years in place and our GOE program is beginning to show results. And as I said, we are bolstered in our confidence -- in our guidance, in part because the quarter did come in a little bit better than we planned. There's no one specific thing that stands out. But overall, it was a little bit better. We had a sense of that confidence already when we spoke at CAGNY. And -- from where we were at that time, it came in pretty much as we thought. Sure. It was strong performance. In our guide for the year, we've said our volumes are going to be flattish overall. And I'd say our expectation by segment is maybe a little bit -- a little bit positive in Flavor Solutions, a little bit negative in the Consumer. But overall, all of it within kind of a plus or minus one range versus flat. And so I think that's a good way to think about it. We do expect to see strong pricing impact the year as we go through the whole year on Flavor Solutions. Brendan, why don't you take that? Well, of course, China was really complicated story this quarter because our first quarter begins in December. And in December, the country was still largely in lockdown -- now they got a train going behind the ground. The country is largely locked down in December, then they reopened and they had a very concentrated pandemic period or a huge proportion of the population. I wonder if you've lost -- but a question of the population got COVID. So that was quite a big impact on McCormick. We thought that post-Chinese New Year would probably begin to see a recovery. And I think we were seeing that unfold after Chinese New Year in a positive way. And in second quarter, we're going to lap the lockdowns from last year, and we're expecting a significant recovery in China. As we go through the second quarter, we're certainly going to have double-digit growth compared to a year ago unless there's some other exogenous shock. The question on that double digit is just what the first number is, but it's going to be big. Brendon? Well, I said that we thought that this would be behind us in the first quarter, and that's largely how it's played out. I'm going to let Mike go for this one. We -- and actually because of the second fourth quarter negative impact, we had a big negative impact in the second quarter and then had a reopening, solid third quarter and then a re-lockdown in the fourth quarter. We're just part of our miss in the fourth quarter. You had no idea that was going to happen when we gave guidance. I think our full year guide for the order of magnitude that you're talking about... I think that absolutely, there is a tremendous opportunity for our sales force this year for a couple of reasons. One is that our service is in much better condition so that we don't have as many unproductive conversations with our customers. The second is the sheer amount of innovation and the balance that we're bringing to our customers is going to be really positive. And Brendan, I'm going to ask you to just say a few words about that. And I think you'll see as we go through the year, that we will steadily improve that flavor solution margin performance. But as Mike said, this is our first quarter, it's also the smallest quarter of the year. We certainly bolstered in our confidence, but we don't want to get overconfident. Well, I think if I took the question mark of replacement, we have the answer. But Brendan, do you want to comment on that? After this quarter. And I would say that it's not true that the business mix has not changed. The business mix has changed, and we continue our portfolio migration towards more value-added products. You hear us talking about pruning the portfolio. We have not been specific because we don't want to talk about things that are -- that might be identifiable to a specific customer, but there's definitely been a movement within our portfolio, both by category and within product categories to improve that business for the long term. And Mike said that we don't look at the pre-pandemic operating margin as a ceiling. As we said at the time, we look to some of our pure labor house peers who publish public numbers who have significantly higher operating margins. That's more what we aspire to in the very long run. Actually, I would say that with our higher -- with our improved service levels, I'd say, our promotional levels have also normalized. Now we were able to support promotional volumes now. The promotions that we run tend to be ROI positive. I think that's an important part of building back market share that we didn't talk about actually in making our points and I'm glad you asked the question. But sometimes promotion is thought of as dealing back price has not what we're talking about. We're talking about quality merchandising events that drive consumer takeaway. We're going to over a little bit over time, but we're going to take everybody's question. So hope they're not too long. Well, as I said, I think our -- our ability to full schedule of merchandising activity with our customers. I think that's part of what gives us confidence in our outlook for the year, frankly, is that we're able to have those kinds of positive conversations with our customers as opposed to some of the negative ones that we might have been having over the last few years about supply and their desire to promote. I mean, I think some great examples are like our French mustard where we finally have bottles in supply, and we've been able to drive 20% volume growth for the last two quarters and gained significant share. And I think that we're going to do a similar thing with growing products. I think the renewal of our ability to meet our core product demand is also allowed us to innovate. And so those promotions, in many cases, are showcasing our products in store, which also, I think, will contribute to volume. And again, our outlook for volume on the Consumer side of the business relatively flat for the year, I think we're up against a tough comparison in the first quarter, and that's part of the reason why volume is down lapping Omicron a year ago and so on. But I think we're pretty optimistic actually on volume. And the pricing actions that we needed to take are loaded to the year. And again, so I think that, that's something that will -- it's not in the way of growing our volume. It's always dangerous when the CEO talks about capital allocation, so I'll let Mike give us the talking here. The one thing I'll say about M&A is it's not our priority right now, but we would not miss a good strategic opportunity. Brendan, why don't you take? And I'm going to say that on the Consumer side, we have tremendous growth plans, including a lot of innovation and the renovation of our everyday spice line, hitting the market in the second quarter and a number of major customer wins that are going to go on shelf in the third quarter. And we're expecting a strong recovery in China in the second quarter. So while it's a dynamic and that we are actually really encouraged about the sales outlook for the rest of the year. That's not our... Well, I will say that, that is a wide-ranging question, and I can go absolutely while answering it. However, we have gotten rid of some -- when I say when we said we're pruning the business, I mean, some of it is not visible, as we talked about on a previous question. But some of it is Kitchen Basics, for example, is a brand that -- well, it's a great brand. We like it a lot. It was the only thing we had in that aisle. It was hard for us to bring our category management tools to bear on it and it was a little bit of an orphan. There was pressure both from leading brands and from private label on that. And we didn't see a good path to grow it with a good return for us, the wrong owner of that brand. And so we've thought about other parts of our portfolio that way. The things that we've gotten out of have tended to be pretty small, though. And that's a good example of one of the bigger things that we've done. Most of what we -- the other things we've gotten out of have been small or would be less familiar to you because they're in a different region of the world. But the innovation that we will do is differentiated. It brings more differentiation to our brand, flavors, blends that are hard to duplicate. We brought on a technology into some of our innovation as we have with the true taste technology that we are using in our new stubs rugs. And I think we just had a tough act to follow. And the renovation that we're doing on our core herbs and spice brands is going to be very differentiating, not just versus private label, but versus other brands. I mean to be able to have that oxygen-free atmosphere that is going to bring freshness to the market and a better appearance and aroma for consumers, that is going to be very differentiating and difficult to follow quickly. That's for sure. And a lot of the things that we're doing around that renovation are either trademarked or patented. And I think -- I mean, I think that everything you look at, whether it's the pruning of our portfolio or the migration of our portfolio to higher value or technically insulated products on the Flavor side, to the innovation that we're bringing in our brands, serves to differentiate us, extend our leadership and push the gap between us and private label to be more of a discussion around total value and cost and benefits than just about the cheapest price. Thanks for your question. And that is our final question. So, I was waiting for the moderator to possibly say something, but that's okay. It's not necessary. But core alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for Flavor in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and our strategic investments provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. We are disciplined and our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. We're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategy, actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from our relative strength. We continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "I would just -- Ken, just to maybe add a few thoughts to that. We did see volume strength in our portfolio, especially -- I think we called it out in the script of it just from snack seasoning on Performance Nutrition and Health, and that's pretty consistent with what we've been seeing, but the offsets really are not related to price elasticity. So I think that's maybe important to call out. And there was a couple of things noted like some cold weather impact on branded foodservice or we're certainly seeing an inflationary impact on our customer base and EMEA. They're going through a fair amount of inflation right now in that market, the consumer is. And just pruning of -- natural pruning of lower margin business. So, those are having an impact, too, on the volume profile. But I think our confidence still for the balance of the year is where Lawrence placed it. Andrew, we still see price gaps continuing to narrow compared to private label. That happened in Q4. We saw it again in Q1. It's really a result of seeing more private label taking price on the shelf. So that seems to be coming through and reading through the scanner data. And we would say and what we're seeing is that the impact just continues to moderate. Again, it's pretty consistent with what we saw in Q4. We really do believe a lot of our initiatives and a focus on value is also having a positive impact on our brands. And we continue this effort, whether it's messaging or focused on value sizes, et cetera. So that's also probably having an impact too. So that's really the nature of what we're seeing right now with regard to price gaps in private label. Yes. It is performing better than we expected right now. And so we're pretty pleased with the performance. A lot of the volume that we are sourcing as we called out, it's definitely incremental to from a retailer standpoint, but also a lot of new brand buyers are coming into the McCormick franchise through Lawry's. I think its people seeking the brand. They're looking for value. And so, we see that playing out. And it's been largely positive as we think about building out even more distribution. These are some of the positive results that we're getting from this. It's just simply turning faster itself. But their -- Lawry's brand really is appealing to sort of a number of consumers. It's really strong with Hispanic households. It's strong with many other sort of demographic groups, and we see them coming into those stores being offered. They may not be buying then private label or they may not be buying in other retail outlets. So that's where we see a lot of the growth coming from in the incrementality. You're going to see more distribution growth on this, though, in 2023. No, I just think, Alexia, we're optimistic that this normalization will continue to unfold in the market. We expect to see much of that come through in Q2. Yes. It isn't -- as we would always say, Rob, it's never just one thing, it's a system of things, and that really drive that competitive strength, and that applies, I think, to your question as well. Yes, we have a big renovation plan as you called out, and that's definitely going to be a big lever. And I think it's all about driving and improving the category. And so our sales organization certainly is kind of selling behind the strength of story. We'll continue to reclaim distribution points, not only over this year, but also over next year. That's part of the process of doing this. But as Lawrence called out, I just think our innovation platform is going to continue building also additional distribution points. We really like our innovation platform and the items that we're coming out with this year. So, we expect to see a lot from that too. And all of these things put together with a very, very strong levels of brand marketing, brings together a really strong category conversation with the retailer. I think importantly, though, we keep pointing out the performance of McCormick and our other brands on shelf just continues to sort of outperform competition. And so those are some of the things that we use in category management to really prove the case that it's a more productive shelf, the more McCormick guidance you have on it. Yes. I mean maybe, Steve, just to focus on the front end of your question first. What we saw in the first quarter, we did -- shipments were in line with consumption. But I think more importantly, the dynamics that we would typically see in the first quarter following a holiday season played out as it behave much like a normal period of time. So that's what we'd hope to see in Q1. That's what we did see in Q1. And what that, I think, means looking ahead now, which is kind of the back end of your question is we see things normalizing and operating a little bit more like we would typically operate. I have to think a little bit of what that means by the end of the year, but we would just see a shift to consumption model really play out as we normally do. Just remember, though, in that fourth quarter, we have a big -- that's our biggest quarter of the year, in our big holiday season. So we tend to kind of even things out after Q1 and then sort of like begins again as we think about that cycle. So that's the way I would think about it. But the important takeaway for me and I think maybe in this call is that we saw a normalization of that, how that would typically behave in Q1. Yes, I would take. It's Rob, as we take a look at kind of the profile that you see in the first quarter, I think that's probably a profile largely that you'll see carried out through the rest of the year. As Mike and Lawrence have said a couple of times, we expect volume to be kind of in that plus or minus to 4% range. So, there's effectively more pricing in Flavor Solutions as a result of kind of the inflation profile that we've talked about. So that should provide, I think, a little bit of indication as to how we think about sort of the balance between Flavor Solutions and Consumer on the sales line. Having said that, we expect continued underlying strength as we go throughout the year in our Consumer business too, but the profile that you see in Q1, I think it tends to move forward that way throughout the rest of the quarters. And we really love the categories we're in, whether it's or Frank's RedHot, things like that. So, it's -- we've intentionally picked these categories."

            "content": "Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 14. Our top line constant currency sales grew 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 2% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the consumer business in Russia and lower consumption due to the COVID-related disruption in China. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased to 1%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline related to the Kitchen Basics, Russia and China impacts I just mentioned as well as a 5% decline in all other volume and product mix. On Slide 15, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, including a 2% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. Growth was broad-based across all product categories, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 2%. Pricing actions were more than fully offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from the lower sales in Russia. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 8%, driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by pricing actions. The combination of lower volume in China due to COVID-related disruptions and the exit of lower-margin business in India drove an 11% reduction in volume. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 18. We grew first quarter constant currency sales of 12%, reflecting a 13% increase from pricing actions and a 1% decline in volume and mix. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 12%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base, which skews to packaged food and beverage companies as well as branded foodservice customers. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth in snack seasonings and flavors for Performance Nutrition and health applications was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low-margin businesses and lower volume of away-from-home products as our customers' business was impacted by cold weather. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 17%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions outstanding growth was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. First quarter volume declined, driven primarily by softness in some of our packaged food and beverage customers volume within their own businesses. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined as the impact of scale back QSR activities in China due to COVID-related disruptions more than offset QSR volume growth outside of China. As seen on Slide 22, gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This is an improvement from our performance last year. While more work needs to be done, we are pleased with our progress and are confident in the actions underway to continue driving further improvement over the balance of the year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by several drivers. First, we're still incurring elevated costs in Flavor Solutions to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful in the short term, we know making these investments to support our customers is the right approach to driving long-term growth. That said, we continue to progress on reducing the level of these costs in the first quarter. Also in Flavor Solutions, we incurred dual running costs related to the transition to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. We expect the balance of the year costs to be comparable to 2022 and a sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments as compared to last year unfavorably impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings as well as the cost savings from our GOE program that Lawrence discussed, and which were in line with our expectations. Finally, end of note, we offset current year inflation in the first quarter, which we expect will be the highest of the year through our pricing actions. And as Lawrence said, we continue to recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as we planned. While the net of these impacts drives gross profit dollar growth, there is level of dilution that tempers the actual gross margin percentage. Now moving to Slide 23. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the first quarter of last year. Higher distribution costs were offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings as well as lower planned brand marketing and employee benefits expenses in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect both brand marketing and employee benefits expenses to be higher than last year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined 40 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. Higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, Consumer segment adjusted operating income increased 6%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 11%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 24. Our interest expense increased significantly over the first quarter of 2022, driven by the higher rate environment. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.63 for the year ago period. The decrease was due to higher interest expense and a higher first quarter adjusted effective tax rate. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $103 million compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $105 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow, driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. Now turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we project an unfavorable act in the first half of the year and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which are consistent with '22 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter, and finally, the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. Adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an even 100 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a further low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI cost savings target of approximately $85 million. We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense, driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be approximately an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook is to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with the continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023. And as you said, Ken, the first quarter to your March Madness, I think we put some points on the board, and we're going to continue focusing on growing the business. And as Lawrence said, we've made real good progress on our cost agenda to it, which is great. Yes. It was a relatively small favorable first quarter, but it will build during the year, as we said on the last conference call. So third and fourth quarter, second half will be significantly higher. That's why you'll see the impact. Last year. Yes, slightly unfavorable at first. But over the next three quarters, really the third and fourth and second half will be -- that's where you'll see the incrementality versus... Yes. If you look at that the 2023 outlook chart in our earnings deck, a 3% impact on EPS, that's the full year impact, which is around... Yes. Those are the -- exactly. Yes. And I think supporting those new products in our brand marketing, we were slightly favorable in the first quarter versus last year, but you'll see in the second quarter that support will increase year-on-year. Again, this is the first quarter. The first quarter results though do really give us -- they bolster our confidence, as Lawrence said, the pricing realization, recovering those costs we've had and, frankly, over recovering in the year, which gives us more confidence, the GEO program, the implementation of those programs, which are very programmatic in nature gives us more confidence. But before we start celebrating, we want to, again, put points on the board in the second quarter. I will note, consumer margins, operating profit margin, up 110 basis points in the first quarter. We're really happy with that. And while Flavor Solutions is still negative, it was about 200 basis points less than that last year. There was a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, and we're really focused on driving those margins higher this year. Yes. I mean basically, like two months ago, we said it's a small impact on first building into the second then in the second half is where you see the significant impact it scales up. Yes. I mean we're roughly comparable on the little bar facility the last year, as we said, I mean, in... After this quarter, but into next year, there's still going to be some carryover into next year. So I almost hesitate to say a number right now. Overall, we've said before around $20 million of kind of dual running costs on an annual basis. So a good chunk of that should go away next year. But again, that depends on there's a lot of factors relating into that. But if you think about this year with Flavor Solutions, the first quarter is one of the highest commodity and other costs were and that will -- just like on the consumer side of the business, that will go down the rest of the year. Pricing realization will support that. Then the GOE business -- the GOE program, and that really benefits both of our segments too. I wouldn't say all of us going to Flavor Solutions. It's really across the board where we've had inefficiencies that have built up in the system since the pre-pandemic. We've called out some of those very clear examples of Flavor Solutions like Topak and things like We think we have a long runway of improvement Flavor Solutions margins. You refer back '18 and '19. I mean our margins are 14-ish range, and we feel we can get back there over time as we over -- we recover those costs, we've talked about as costs moderate as we get more efficient. So we don't see 2019 as really the ceiling. And our portfolio -- the pruning portfolio driving more towards the higher-margin products as we -- you've seen accelerated growth there we talked about today. So, we do -- but it's not going to happen snap your fingers by the end of this year. This is a program that is going to play out over the next couple of years. Well, I mean the three things we said in the last earnings call, where the significant inflation and we're recovering that inflation now through incremental pricing. The significant incremental costs we've incurred since pre-COVID, we're addressing them through the GOE program across both segments and the incremental cost for driving additional capacities as an example, a little of our investment. So, those three things have really driven that operating profit degradation, which we are in the process of now reversing. Well, we've said, I mean, the first quarter is the highest of our inflation rates turned out to be that way, and it will go down the rest of the year sequentially. GOE was a small impact as you referred to. CCI roughly, is really spread throughout the year. So we don't get really specific around what CCI occurs because it's a continuous program. So you have every quarter. It's approximately the same level as last year or slightly higher, depending on your guidance. We said that this year is $85 million. Last year, it was $85 million, so probably roughly the same. But I think as you think about the margin improvement, the pricing realization that we've seen -- as you've seen in our numbers, is really driving a good chunk of that. So that's what gives us confidence on the rest of the year too. We're recovering these costs. We said that we incurred the last couple of years. We're catching up this year, and you've seen that in the first quarter. Yes. And I'd say like we've said, both at CAGNY and probably in the earnings -- last earnings call two months ago, I mean our priorities right now is paying down debt, generating more cash, getting our debt-to-EBITDA back down to 3x by the end of 2024. So really nothing has changed from that. And we continue -- as Lawrence said, we continue to look at great assets along the way, but our priority right now is paying down debt."

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Marcos Gabriel, Senior Vice President, Global Finance and Capital Markets and Incoming CFO. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statement on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin reviewing our financial results, I would like to address Hurricane Helene. Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by this devastating storm. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Now moving to our results. Our third quarter performance is aligned with our expectations, especially as we continue to navigate an evolving and complex consumer landscape. Our results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments in the areas that we believe will drive the most value and improved unit share trends, drive volume growth and capitalize on our advantaged categories. As we have said, McCormick remains a growth company and our investments in 2024 are yielding results that support our confidence in delivering on our top-tier long-term objectives. We're excited to share our strategic roadmap and building blocks that support these long-term objectives at our upcoming Investor Day. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results, focusing on the top line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on consumer trends, highlight some areas of success and the areas that we continue to work on. Mick will then go into more depth on the third quarter financial results and Marcos will review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the third quarter, sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting flat pricing, 1% volume and product mix as well as the impact of our canning divestiture. This quarter, we reached a meaningful milestone by delivering total positive volume growth despite the challenging environment. Our volume trends improved sequentially across both consumer and flavor solutions. Our results to date, coupled with our proven growth plans, fuel our continued confidence in our ability to deliver on the mid to high end of our constant currency sales growth guidance. In our Consumer segment in the Americas, we delivered solid sequential volume improvement for the third consecutive quarter, leading to 1% volume growth. Volume growth reflects our continued focus on accelerating innovation and alignment with consumer trends and expanding distribution. Our pricing reflects the continuation of our price gap management plans to support improved volumes as planned. In EMEA, we continue to drive positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories for the third consecutive quarter. We realized benefits from new product innovation and expanded distribution. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we delivered strong volume-led sales growth as we continue to benefit from the rollout of our new consumer-preferred packaging for our core spices and seasonings portfolio as well as distribution gains. This performance was tempered by China, slightly more than we had originally expected. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the environment in China to remain challenged and this is reflected within our guidance. Marcos will provide more color on this when he covers our outlook for the remainder of the year. Moving to Flavor Solutions. We delivered strong sequential volume improvement, primarily driven by growth in the Americas. In the EMEA, our volume trends were impacted by softness in our QSR customers' volumes. And in Asia Pacific, our results were impacted by the timing of customer promotions. From a profitability perspective, we delivered strong results relative to the prior year, as the third quarter benefited primarily from the timing of investments, which are shifting to the fourth quarter. As we look at the second half of the year, operating income results remained largely in line with our expectations and earnings per share results are slightly ahead due to a discrete tax item benefit. Let me now share our view on the state of the consumer, which has remained similar since we reported our second quarter results. Overall, consumers are resilient, but remain challenged. They are exhibiting value-seeking behavior making more frequent trips to the grocery store with smaller baskets and shopping just for what they need. They are also focused on reducing waste and stretching their budgets. Foodservice traffic remains soft across most restaurant types, particularly in QSRs. These trends are starting to benefit growth in food at home and this shift is driven by older generations as well as lower income households. Consumers overall continue to cook at home and they are increasingly shopping the perimeter for protein and produce. This further reinforces their demand for flavor and McCormick's categories, included spices and seasonings as well as condiments and sauces. Flavor is not something consumers are willing to sacrifice. Spices and extracts remain the number one center store growth category. From a value perspective, we are seeing several trends. Demand for larger sizes remains elevated. At the same time, there is increased demand for small or trial sizes as well as onetime use recipe mixes, highlighting that flavor exploration remains important to consumers and our plans need to match that demand with the right product offering. Gen Z, our new and future customers, are also cooking at home. They're interested in seasoning blends that make cooking easier and convenient. Interestingly, they are leaning into higher quality and premium flavor items. We're seeing velocity pick up on our gourmet line and it's coming from Gen Z as they seek to recreate restaurant quality meals. As we step back and reflect on all these trends, it reinforces the importance of our consumer-centric mindset, which is present across our entire business. It's at the heart of everything that we do at McCormick. We are strengthening our broad portfolio to meet evolving consumer demands and delighting them with innovation. And we believe we have the right plans in place that are continually informed by what matters most to our consumers and customers. Moving to Slide 5. Let me highlight for the quarter some of the key areas of our success. In our Global Consumer segment, we drove solid unit consumption growth in spices and seasoning across our key markets in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In the US, we continue to improve on our competitiveness relative to private label as our volume consumption outpaced private label for spices and seasonings this quarter. This quarter, our grilling portfolio outpaced category growth on unit sales, displays, velocity and distribution. And in the fourth quarter, we are excited to begin the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for Grill Mates, ahead of next year's grilling season. In recipe mixes, we continue to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas, driving both unit and volume share and outpacing private label in the US. Our Cholula line continues to be a significant driver of growth. We are innovating with Cholula recipe mixes, bringing new consumers to the category, particularly with millennials and younger families. In EMEA, recipe mixes were a significant driver of UK volume growth and realized dollar market share gains for two consecutive quarters. In Mustard, we had a strong quarter as we drove both unit and volume share in the Americas. In addition, our unit and volume growth outpaced private label in the US. In Poland, mustard consumption continues to grow and we are realizing unit and dollar market share gains. We made great progress over the last two quarters and are pleased to see that our plans are driving the expected improvement. In Americas Consumer, the declines we previously experienced in the prepared food categories that we participate in like Frozen and Asian, which represent a small part of our portfolio, have now stabilized, and we are seeing improved growth. We continue to make progress on total distribution points. We expanded TDPs and gained TDP share in spices and seasonings, recipe mixes and mustard in the Americas. Finally, in the Americas and EMEA, we drove double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, outpacing the market. E-commerce was a significant driver of our unit consumption growth for the quarter as consumers continue to seek convenience. In Flavor Solutions, we saw strength in both of our technically insulated high-margin product categories, branded foodservice and flavors. In Americas branded foodservice business, despite softness in the overall foodservice market, we grew volumes and expanded points of distribution across spices and seasonings and condiments. In addition, we are winning hot sauce tabletop share behind new distribution, packaging and promotion. In Flavors, our consumer packaged food customers are seeing some improvement in volumes within their own business in both the Americas and EMEA. In the Americas, our performance with high-growth innovator customers remained strong. We delivered solid growth in Performance Nutrition beverages as well as alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, outpacing category growth. Let me now touch on some areas where we're seeing some pressure. In Hot Sauce, we continue to have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our share trends remain impacted by a peer that is lapping their own supply chain disruptions. In the Americas, our unit share trends improved sequentially. However, volumes are impacted by mini trial sizes. We are pleased so far with the performance of Frank's minis. Minis are incremental to the category and are driving trial of our new flavors. We expect our innovation, expanded distribution and brand marketing to help improve our trends as we exit 2024. In Flavor Solutions, our volumes were impacted by slower QSR traffic, particularly in EMEA. We have seen this pressure impact our results for several quarters. It's difficult to predict QSR traffic. However, we are collaborating with our customers as they focus on improving their volumes through innovation and value aligned with consumer trends. In Asia Pacific, volume was soft as was impacted by slower QSR traffic outside of China, most notably in Australia and Southeast Asia, where some of our customers remain impacted by geopolitical boycotts. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season. With our promotion and innovation plans, we are well positioned entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels, supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns and are expecting a strong holiday season. Before I wrap up, let me reiterate our growth plans on Slide 6, which support our performance year-to-date and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and into 2025. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories. We have several initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. And I look forward to sharing more details on these plans at our upcoming Investor Day. To wrap up, let me share three key points. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continue to be strong. And importantly, consumer interest in cooking remains strong. We are dedicated to accelerating our volume trends. We refine and adapt our plans as needed and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to sustainable volume-led growth. You should continue to expect improvement as we close the year and into 2025 and beyond. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Today's earnings call is bittersweet for me as it marks my last one as CFO of this incredible company before I retire. Reflecting on my tenure of more than three decades, I am filled with immense pride and gratitude for our entire team and appreciate all of their contributions and efforts over the years. Lastly, I would like to thank all of you, our sell-side analysts and investors, for your time and engagement over the years. Your thoughtful questions and insights have been invaluable to me, and they reflect your commitment to understanding our business and long-term strategy. Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. Starting on Slide 8, our top line sales were comparable to the third quarter of last year, including the impact of the canning divestiture and reflect 1% volume growth, partially offset by pricing. In our Consumer segment, sales were comparable with the prior year as the 1% impact of pricing investments was offset by 1% volume growth, reflecting solid sequential improvement from the second quarter. On Slide 9, consumer sales in the Americas were comparable with the prior year. This reflects 1% volume growth offset by pricing investments and this volume growth was driven by our core categories. We continue to take a surgical and data-driven approach to managing price gaps and our investments are still expected to impact about 15% of our Americas consumer segment. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 3%, driven by volumes of 4%, partially offset by pricing of 1%. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were flat, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we delivered volume-led growth that was broad-based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 12. Third quarter constant currency sales were comparable to the prior year, reflecting a contribution from price, which was fully offset by a 1% impact of the divestiture of the canning business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales increased 3%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price and a 2% increase in volume, driven by the timing of customer activities as well as strength in branded foodservice. In the EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 9%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business, lower volume and product mix of 5%, reflecting the impact of QSR customers volumes and lower price of 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales were comparable in constant currency with minimal contributions from both price and volume. As Brendan mentioned, our volumes in APAC were impacted by slower QSR traffic outside of China, most notably in Australia and Southeast Asia, where some of our customers remain impacted by geopolitical boycotts. This was offset by growth in China due to QSR customer promotions. As seen on Slide 16, gross profit margin expanded by 170 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by favorable mix within our Flavor Solutions segment and the impact of our comprehensive continuous improvement program or CCI. Now moving to Slide 17. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A decreased relative to the third quarter of last year, driven by lower distribution costs generated by our CCI program and lower employee-related benefit expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 15% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 or 16% in constant currency, with gross margin expansion and lower SG&A expenses both contributing. Operating profit benefited from a shift in the timing of our investments, which now will be reflected in our fourth quarter results. Marcos will address this shortly when he reviews our outlook for the remainder of the year. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment increased 8% with minimal impact from currency. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 31% or 32% in constant currency, reflecting our continued focus on restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments to fuel top line growth. And touching on tax. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 16.8% compared to 21.4% in the year-ago period. The tax rate benefited from the resolution of an outstanding tax matter dating back several years as well as our state sales mix. As a result, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the year, which is slightly better than the 22% rate we had previously provided and reflects the discrete items I just discussed. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. It is important to note that in the fourth quarter, we will be lapping strong results in the prior year period for McCormick de Mexico. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 20, third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 as compared to $0.65 for the year ago period. This increase was primarily due to our increased operating profit as well as the discrete tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. With that, let me turn the call over to Marcos, who will cover our balance sheet and outlook for 2024.\nMarcos Gabriel: Thanks, Mike. On Slide 22, we'll summarize highlights for our cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first nine months of 2024, our cash flow from operations was $463 million compared to $660 million in 2023. The benefit from the increasing earnings year-over-year was more than offset by the impact of cash used for working capital, increased incentive compensation payments and timing of cash tax payments. We returned $338 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $189 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, return a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to strong investment grade rating and expect our leverage ratio to be below three times for 2024 with another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 23. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are now expected to have a minimal impact on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a change from the previously anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1% and anticipate our results will be at the mid to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we anticipate about a 1% increase for the year, similar to what we said last quarter. In China, our food away from home business, which is included in APAC consumer, continues to be impacted by lower demand. And we now expect China consumer sales to be down slightly compared to 2023 for the full year, while we presently expect it to be flat, and this is reflected within our guidance. While we recognize there has been continued weak demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term trajectory of the China business. Moving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. In addition to our gross margin expansion, SG&A benefits from cost savings will be partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. For the year, we continue to expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single-digits, reflecting a double-digit increase in investment partially offset by CCI savings. In terms of tax, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the year, which is slightly better than the 22% rate we had previously provided and reflects the benefit of discrete items Mike mentioned earlier. We continue to expect mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico for the year. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.85 to $2.90 reflects a 5% to 7% increase compared to 2023 and we anticipate our results will be close to the high end of the range as we benefit from the improved tax rate. As we head into the fourth quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes to consider. We expect to drive volume growth in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions and sequential improvement from the third quarter. Pricing is expected to have a slight negative impact with the price investments in our Consumer segment, only partially offset by Flavor Solutions. We expect gross margins to sequentially improve from the third quarter and to be flat relative to the prior year, driven by price a comparable year-over-year Flavor Solutions product mix and planned supply chain investments to support growth. We expect our investments in brand marketing to ramp sequentially from the third quarter and anticipate an increase in SG&A year-over-year related to IT and digital transformation investments shifting into the fourth quarter and I will talk more about these investments at our upcoming Investor Day. As a result, our operating profit will likely be comparable with the prior year due mostly to the time of our investment. However, this remained largely in line with how we had expected our operating profit to perform for the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results. Our return to volume light growth underscores that we are moving in the right direction and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2024 financial outlook and long-term objectives over time.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Marcos. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 24. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, especially as it marks an inflection point for total company volumes turning positive. This demonstrates that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value and reinforces our confidence in our plans and long-term objectives. We continue to execute on our strategic roadmap with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer trends, further capitalizing on our attractive categories across segments. In addition, our plans are yielding the expected results. We also continued to expand margins and manage our costs as we are investing in the business. These improvements are led by our favorable product mix and cost savings programs. Our results in the third quarter benefited from the timing of these investments and we continue to expect our second half operating profit results to be in line with our expectations. Our year-to-date performance coupled with our growth plans give us confidence in achieving the mid to high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions, particularly as we navigate this complex environment and reiterate my confidence that together we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Good morning, everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Brendan, it's certainly nice to see the continued sequential volume improvement in consumer, especially in the Americas. I think pricing in consumer was a little less than a point and that was pretty close to where expectations were. But I'm curious if you're seeing the expected magnitude of volume lift right from some of these pricing actions and investments that you've made? And I guess, if you are, would there be a reason maybe to lean in even a little bit further right to keep the momentum going, given you've got some flexibility this year from things like tax rate and some below the line items?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Let me just maybe lead in with a couple of opening thoughts here. I mean, we do continue to make the right progress, and we're on track with where we expected to be. We turned the corner in our growing volume, which was obviously as we started the year, our goal in the second half of the year. I think importantly, we're outperforming private label and volume across all of our core categories and I do like the progress that we're making in Flavor Solutions especially in this last quarter in the Americas region. Having said that, we're never going to be satisfied. So I think that we still see an opportunity to continue strengthening our plans and execution in the back, the rest of '24 going into '25. But our programs are working and we believe they're delivering the growth that we thought that they would. Just to add context on all those levers that on top of that price gap management that you referred to that we think are really driving our business. It is increased investment in brand marketing and A&P just across all of our core categories. We've launched innovation that's really contributed meaningfully to our performance. And that's been an exciting part because that's a lot more innovation that we launched in 2022 and 2023 which was an important goal that we had here in '24. We're expanding distribution in our core categories. I think we had a really good quarter there in terms of performance as we expected it would start to build. And in terms of pricing, we maintain that price gap management program that we've talked about in the third quarter. It will continue to play out as expected in the fourth quarter too, but it's only a portion of our strategy, but it is yielding I think the results that we expected from that. And I just would add, we're also operating in great categories. So let's not forget that that's also part of the, I think, the strength behind our businesses that we do operate in really strong categories. I do want to say broadly at a global level, we also saw really good performance across the consumer segment at a global level, definitely in EMEA, Australia, Southeast Asia, we just saw broadly good performance, including our spices and seasonings category growing volume across the entire consumer segment for McCormick. Having said all of that, I think our guidance is appropriate, given the dynamic consumer environment. So we're confident in our plans and we will be at that mid to high end of our top line range. But we also have to really, I think, make sure that we reflect what's going on in the environment right now. Hey, China is slightly worse than we expected and it does remain challenging. So we're factoring that into our thinking. QSR trends continue to be a bit uncertain. And so that's kind of factored into our thinking too. And as we go into the fourth quarter, as all of you know, this is the biggest part of the year for us. So we want to make sure that we're balanced and we deliver on our expectations, but it is a big quarter for us.\nAndrew Lazar: And that's helpful. Thank you. And then quick one is, I think you mentioned that your sort of prepared foods business in the Americas, which had been weaker was stabilizing and that trends in the sales that you make to other sort of packaged food manufacturers were starting to look a bit better, I think you mentioned. So I guess as it relates to the sort of the industry as a whole right where the big debate is when do we start to see some sort of better volume trends recover and whatnot across the space. Your view into that based on some of the businesses that you've got seemed to suggest maybe that's sort of starting to happen, albeit gradually. I'm curious to get your sense on your view into that aspect. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Yes. I think and that certainly bridges off of our second quarter call. More or less, our customer plans were performing as expected, which was, we were expecting some improvement compared to the second quarter. And so we believe that largely did start to play out. Our Flavors business in the Americas region, we saw good results across those areas that we consider like high innovator growth customers. So that plays out in categories like Performance Nutrition or alcoholic beverages or nonalcoholic beverages, but we believe we outperformed the category broadly there. And then we did see strength in our branded foodservice business. And that also played into, I think, some of the improvement that we're seeing broadly across Flavor Solutions, the segment. Having said that, QSR traffic was weak and slower than probably we would have expected, but that's speaking back again to that level of uncertainty. However, having said that, we do see our customers being responsive to what's going on in the market and trying to drive volume growth et cetera. So we do think as we go into Q4, that trend should continue broadly that we see sequential improvement from the third quarter.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much and see you in a couple of weeks.\nBrendan Foley: Great.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: Hi and Mike thanks again for everything and we appreciate all your help over the years. Two questions, if I can. Number one, I don't think you quantified, forgive me if you did, the timing of the activities of your customers, how much that benefited 3Q. I think it was largely in Americas Flavor Solutions, but just wanted to clarify that. And you did say that shift will be reflected in 4Q results. Just making sure we should kind of model all of that reversing in 4Q and then I have a follow-up.\nMike Smith: Yes. This is Mike. Yes, as we said in the last call, there's a bit of a positive that was going to come into the third quarter from Q2 and that happened. It wasn't the biggest you know Brendan talked about the really good Flavor Solutions underlying performance and Branded Foodservice and other areas. But that did have a positive impact in Q3, which will kind of normalize in Q4 as we think about year-on-year comparisons.\nKen Goldman: Okay. And then for my follow-up, I know you're -- it's too early to talk about 2025, but I'll take a quick stab anyway. I guess the main question is, I'll give it a shot. Is there any reason to think at this time you won't be on algo? And the reason I'm asking is you have talked volume growth into next year. You kind of reiterated that a little bit today. You previously said you have the right level of investments in place, so I don't expect that to rise. You always have great CCI. So just trying to get a sense, is there anything you're seeing? Obviously, there's hot sauce, there's QSRs, there's China in general that could hold you back, but there's other positives happening as well. So just wanted to get that sense. And then while you're answering it, I'm just curious, what is the underlying EPS algo ex-M&A? I mean many years ago, you said that the combination of M&A and repo would contribute around 2% in the average year to EPS, but I wasn't sure how you broke that down today. So hopefully that makes sense. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, that last follow-up question, I like to have maybe a few buried in there. So I'm going to do my best to remember everything, but I'm going to ask Mike and Marcos to help me out with this. Yes, we're not prepared to talk about '25 guidance at this point. So although in Investor Day, we feel like we'll share more context about how we're looking at the future and how we think about overall performance and what will drive our long-term volume growth, which is something that we've historically done. And so we'll spend some time talking about our view into what will be those drivers as we look from a long-term perspective. And when I think about what's going well in '24 and why should it continue in '25, it's just we believe that these are the right programs and the right things to do in our business. And these are things that we believe is part of just doing a good job and delivering growth within our categories. Mike, do you want to add anything else on the EPS question?\nMike Smith: Yes, I would just add too, as we, if you go back to guidance early or late in January in CAGNY, the things we talked about making investments this year to really drive the second half volume growth, which we're attaining. We're happy with the performance, not totally satisfied, as Brendan said. We'd love to do more, but build that momentum into 2025. There's uncertainty in the economic market, as there always is, but we feel like we're well positioned. And I think you'll hear more from Investor Day, which would be in three weeks.\nBrendan Foley: Yes, that's right.\nKen Goldman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Thanks for taking the questions. And Mike thanks again. Maybe to follow-up on Ken's question just around this year. The gross margin guidance, I think, we're getting questions this morning. Just you're up 125 basis points year-to-date. Obviously, you didn't move the gross margin guidance higher. And maybe there's some timing factors there. But just trying to understand if there's maybe a bit of conservatism in there as well and why that rate of change just wouldn't kind of continue through the fourth quarter.\nMike Smith: Yes. If you think about it and some perspective here, we talked about this year in half a lot, first half, second half. And because, as you know, a quarter can such a small unit of measure, sometimes you get some moves. But so we try to keep it pretty high level in half this year. And we've seen really good sequential improvement first half into second half. And actually, by quarter, it's gone that way too. We see the fourth quarter actually higher gross margin than the third quarter, which is our normal trend. So we're really happy with that. Year-on-year, you always get a little mix sometimes that happens. We talk about normalizing mix versus last year in the Flavor Solutions side, not necessarily from third to fourth quarter, but from fourth quarter of this year to last year. Marcos highlighted some of the supply chain investments and I'll let him talk about that in a second. And there's a slight pricing quarter year-on-year comparison there that puts a little bit of pressure, not a whole lot. But why don't you talk a little bit about that?\nMarcos Gabriel: Yes. So you think about the gross margin and the puts and takes between Q3 and Q4. We're thinking about Q4 as more of a normalized Flavor Solutions product mix than Q3. So we think about it that way. We're also thinking about some of the supply chain investments that we had planned for the year around building capacity, particularly around the heat platform that we have continued to invest in the platform will be impacting Q4 more so than the rest of the year. So that is an impact there. And also, I would say that in a little of pricing, we're going to have a slightly negative pricing in consumer going into Q4 offset by partially offset by Flavor Solutions, but there's going to be a little bit of that negative impact through pricing as we continue to invest back in the business to drive top line growth. So there are some elements between Q3 and Q4. As Mike said, some puts and takes between the two quarters. I think if you look at the second half profitability it's very much in line with what we expected before.\nBrendan Foley: And you'll hear us today talk about Investor Day about 10 times, but this heat investments that we're making in supply chain, I think you'll be excited to see the potential, as we've talked about in the past on heat, but it's really driving a lot of our growth, which is great.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe just pivoting. Brendan, I wanted to ask you on China specifically. I think maybe you spent some time there earlier this year and the market at least seems to be rewarding China exposed stocks in the past week or so on the back of some of the macro there. Just curious kind of get your perspectives on if there is some kind of stimulus policy in China, how you're thinking about improved consumer demand or improved consumer psyche there. Any perspectives would be helpful. Thanks very much.\nBrendan Foley: Sure, Peter. On China, we do expect the environment there. It's going to remain broadly challenged. And we do expect our business probably to be down slightly in '24. So just for the sake of clarity, I mean, that's the outlook that we're looking at for the balance of our year. But when you reference, I think, this latest news on stimulus, I'm just not in a position to sort of predict the impact of that. I will say though in previous actions that have been taken in terms of in the country regarding stimulus, I don't know that they've necessarily had a material impact on our sort of the consumption in our business. And so at this moment, right now, we believe that they'll just continue to make sequentially good progress. It's just not the speed we thought it might happen. And by the way, we didn't plan on a lot, I think, this year in China to begin with. So it's just a little bit, it's more muted than we expected. And I think given the latest economic news out of the country, we're still waiting to see what kind of impact that might have.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. So can I ask about the margin recovery in Flavor Solutions. I think you mentioned that it may have been driven partially by product mix. I'm just wondering how much more runway there is for continued improvement on that side and specifically what the mix driver was?\nMike Smith: Yes, Alexia. You think about our long-term journey on Flavor Solutions and we've talked about portfolio migration in the past and more recently. And as you think about the things that are higher margin within that portfolio, Branded Foodservice, as Brendan mentioned, had a really good quarter gaining share, driving growth some of the categories within flavors, which we're gaining share in Performance Nutrition and things like that again lean to the higher margin side of things. So it's a little indication of a proof point of our vision to move these margins higher as we migrate the portfolio. Considering with the CCI, as someone mentioned CCI before again another bedrock. We've taken you know we approved Flavor Solutions margins in the last two years through our CCI and our global operating effectiveness program, continue that CCI journey there. We'll talk about that more at Investor Day too. So, yes, I think we're very positive on Flavor Solutions longer term. Quarter-to-quarter, it's going to, we've talked about this business sometimes being lumpy. I think we've got to come up with another word since I'll be leaving, but volatile. But again there is a room for margin improvement here.\nMarcos Gabriel: And also just add to that, Mike, for me as we continue to grow the business, we'll see leverage coming through the P&L and that is also going to impact our margins going forward.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned Branded Foodservice being a big driver of the margin improvement on the Flavor Solutions side. Is that because traffic is improving in the quick service restaurants as their value menus are picking up? Or is it something different that's happening? I think you mentioned share gains? Just trying to get a flavor for what's happening on the Branded Foodservice side and what's driving that? Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Alexia, to give you a flavor of that, just to repeat the pun a little bit. The drivers on Branded Foodservice have less to do with traffic trends. In fact we see them quite subdued still at this point in time, and they have been for the last even in the second quarter when we reported, we saw just depressed trends from a traffic perspective in most sort of segments within foodservice. The driver of our growth seems to be or it is gaining share, gaining more tabletop placements on things like Frank's RedHot. And just broadly, I think winning in the marketplace with our full platform of both spices and seasonings and also condiments and sauces. And so we like the programs that we drive and that we run. And often what you'll see, I think, in that business is we're doing a lot of limited time offers with our brands. So brands like Cholula or Frank's RedHot tend to be brands that we've seen operators like to use as leverage as ways of driving interest and excitement on their menu because those are obviously flavors that are quite appealing to consumers. And so we're seeing that part of our Branded Foodservice business pick up even a little bit more because we've been running a lot more of those types of programs and promotions with our customer base. So it's really doing well in a tough marketplace, I think, is broadly the answer I would give.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. Just to follow-up on Flavor Solutions margin. So you had a very strong quarter, up 300 basis points year-over-year. I think it's the highest margin we've seen for that segment since the pandemic started. And by our math and the few assumptions we're making, it would seem like the guidance for the full year implies you have a pretty big step back in 4Q in Flavor Solutions margins. It sounds like product mix is one headwind you're seeing on the horizon, although it wasn't clear to me if you're saying product mix was abnormal in 4Q '23 and it's a tough compare or abnormal in 3Q '24. I mean you take a step back towards a more normal mix in 4Q '24. But I'm curious if there's any other factors you're seeing on the horizon? Or this is really just some conservatism for the volatility and lumpiness of the segment? Thanks.\nMike Smith: Thanks. Yes, I'd say it's more balanced, honestly. I mean again quarter-to-quarter, you're going to get some variability here. If you look back at the fourth quarter last year, as I mentioned before, the kind of compare and mix, it's normalizing. Supply chain investments, I think, honestly, if you think about it, supply chain investments, the things we're doing on heat Marcos talked about, impact Flavor Solutions. It's a smaller sales base too, so you probably get more of a gross margin impact. But for the year, going back to your comment, we're on plan. We're happy with the margin improvement there.\nMarcos Gabriel: But overall, I mean, our operating profit should -- margin should improve for the full year versus last year. So we are going to continue to make that sequential improvement in terms of operating margin. So we've increased margins by 200 basis points 2023 versus 2022 and that will continue to drive operating margin up for the full year as we had planned before.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks. And then turning to hot sauce in the US. So it sounds like it remains a challenge. You're still seeing pressure from peers' trial size package offerings. It sounds like also that you're pleased with the initial reaction to your own trial size packages. But can you just give us an update on what you're seeing there? What you expect from your action plans over the coming quarters? Thanks very much. I'll leave it there.\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Max, yes, thank you for the question on hot sauce. Hot sauce is an attractive category. There's new competition always entering the category. So that's something that we sort of deal with all the time. And but we as I said in the prepared remarks, we really do like the underlying health of our base business and just continued strong consumer loyalty. And this is also part of our portfolio that's also receiving a fair amount of increased investment. But there is one thing that's really, I think, impacting from a share perspective, just two particular things going on in the marketplace. A peer of ours is lapping a big supply chain constraint from the prior year, which hasn't affected our business as much, but definitely affect theirs. And so we're seeing that volume return back under their label. But also, we're seeing a lot of surge in unit volume from these mini trial sizes, which we were able to participate in or begin to participate in the third quarter. Our units are holding up well in this category too. So there is a fair amount of noise going on in the hot sauce category. And so when we look at those minis, just to give you some more perspective around that, we're seeing a lot of pickup in velocity. What it's doing is it's helping us drive trial on new flavors. I think we have sriracha in there, and we also have a creamy buffalo sauce. Both were super good. But at a dollar, these are really low price points for consumers to just really, it lowers the barrier to trial. And so we've seen a nice pickup in velocity on those mini trial sizes and expect that obviously to be a positive part of our portfolio or that brand assortment that we'll have moving forward. I also do want to draw attention to. We have strongly acceptance on our overall innovation like our Frank's RedHot Squeeze products that are coming out, Frank's Dill Pickle Hot Sauce. These are items from an innovation perspective and then kind of rolling out in the market in the back half of this year and we like the performance that we've seen there. So we'll continue to work through that. We believe we'll have better performance as we move towards the end of 2024 sequentially improved versus the third quarter. But this is an area that we get a lot of attention to and it's an exciting area in the store.\nMax Gumport: Thanks very much. Very helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Powers: Yes, hi, good morning.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Powers: Just the first question on the planned ramp in marketing and advertising support that you called out and that's implied in the fourth quarter guidance. I'm curious as to sort of how much of that is just more intense programming around holidays and sort of specific to stimulating 4Q demand versus maybe more everyday programming that has maybe a more durable ROI in '25?\nBrendan Foley: Well, when you think about the fourth quarter and our posture walking into the fourth quarter, I think maybe a good way to think about it is, we still have the same level of programs and activity that's been driving our business results. And we expect that will continue in its strength going into the fourth quarter. So we're not pulling back or anything like that. But we like the progress and the results that we're getting across the portfolio with those investments and those plans and programs. It's also our big holiday season quarter. And we really do believe we have very strong holiday plan setup with our customers. And so this is an area that we expect to have really good performance in the holiday. And so that obviously is a tick up when you think about it sequentially from the third quarter and that's something to be expected.\nMike Smith: But some of this, as you mentioned, every day we talked about Frank's RedHot Sauce early in the year turning that on every day, so that's a change we made earlier this year.\nStephen Powers: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then I know this is very new, but the dock workers' strike that's in news this morning. I guess from your perspective, I'm assuming that if it's relatively short lived, the impact is relatively manageable. But from the outside, how long if this extends, how long before this becomes a more material issue for you based on your current visibility inventory levels?\nBrendan Foley: Thanks for the question on this, Steve. On the East Coast port strike, from an inbound supply planning perspective for us, we've been contingency planning on this on the potential for this since like April of this year. We really have been thinking about this as maybe something that could happen. And so we've been planning our actions around that possibility. We've also coordinated mitigation plans with our domestic suppliers because they might be counting on inbound supply coming from outside the United States. So we believe we've mitigated most of those risks with the strike now officially occurring. But we believe we're broadly covered. We are monitoring it daily, though, just to make sure that we don't have any interruption of supply, but we feel like we planned for this. Overall, though, we encourage both sides to work through this as productively as they can and with pace because this is something obviously that we don't want to see have a long extended event. But that -- those were our thoughts right now on that and we're going to watch it closely like everyone else.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Just two quick ones. I guess first one is just kind of wanted to get maybe a little bit more color on Q4 because I think kind of around midpoint of the EPS implied guide, it looks like it's down about 15% year-over-year. But at the same time, it sounds like maybe sales could be a little bit better sequentially like relative to what we're seeing in Q3 and then the comments around gross margin, seems like gross margin a little bit more normalized, but still better than Q3, maybe flat year-over-year. So kind of what's implied, everything we're talking about, right, is like SG&A should be up a decent amount. And then I guess there is a little bit of implied tax rate headwind, but then also like income from unconsolidated clearly has been up like 50% year-over-year, year-to-date versus the mid-teens guide. So I'm just trying to kind of gauge like what's the core driver of that year-over-year absolute EPS implied decline in Q4 and it sounds like it's SG&A. Thanks.\nMike Smith: Yes, I think you kind of walked the P&L very well highlighting kind of the squeeze there. We talked about the SG&A investments we're making and that was a timing shift in some of the supply chain investments. Just to touch on tax and unconsolidated really briefly and I'll let Marcos then cover a little bit of the other stuff. But the tax, so a little bit of a headwind after some pretty large favorables that we talked about in the call, which were more timing related, but we did call the tax rate down for the whole year by 1%. But unconsolidated, really great performance by McMex continues. We're lapping a really great performance in the fourth quarter of last year, but also the pace that hits the value pretty significantly. So I think that's part of the reason that it may look wonky to you on that line. But maybe I'll turn it to Marcos to talk a little bit more about the P&L.\nMarcos Gabriel: Yes, yes. So we talked about the top line, I mean, sequentially improving from Q3 into Q4. We gave the mid to high double the range in terms of the full year. But that means if you think about Q4, it's going to improve both in Consumer and Flavor Solutions from Q3. The same applies to gross margin. Even gross margin is going to continue to improve sequentially from Q3 into Q4. If you compare with prior year, it's going to be flat, given the reasons that I mentioned before in terms of the investments that we're making in supply chain, the normalization of the mix a bit on the Flavor Solutions side, and some of the pricing that within Consumer that's going to be partially offset by Flavor Solutions. So that's how we see the gross margin coming into Q4. On SG&A, we had some investments that shifted from Q3 to Q4 as well, particularly around IT and digital transformation. As you know, we have a digital transformation journey across the company. I'm going to be commenting more about that at the Investor Day. But we see some investments in Q4 around digital marketing. In terms of data analytics, we are putting a hub around data analytics to serve the business as well as some efficiencies across manufacturing. Some of the investments that we're making in terms of digital transformation that is really kind of a lending in Q4. So that's a little bit of that impact that you see. But operating profit is going to be comparable to last year, so for Q4. And those are kind of the puts and takes that we see from Q3 to Q4.\nMike Smith: I think the other thing, Rob, I mean, if you get to the fourth quarter, again, it's one quarter out of four. It's the biggest quarter. Again, it's a little bit of a squeeze play. So we've already, in essence, narrowed the sales by going mid to high earlier in the year, we've kind of said zero to 1% in essence. We've never gone below 1% of the spread in the fourth quarter. So it's just you get a little bit into that, you get a math exercise. So the range is maybe a little bit more than you'd like. But I think you've understood that in the past.\nRob Dickerson: Yes, yes, yes. All very helpful. Very clear. And then maybe just one easy follow-up. I just I heard you kind of mentioned a couple of times throughout the call kind of that, let's call it, more little IT, digital transformation spend, right? I mean, it doesn't sound like that's like the lion's share of like what's coming in Q4. Maybe there's some timing shift. And I also respect the fact that you're not talking '25 and probably don't even want to talk long-term. That's for the Investor Day. But is there like something more to that? Is that like a, yes, I mean, there could be a little bit more of kind of an investment program around kind of a bigger piece of kind of where we're viewing the digital IT side and that could be ongoing for a little bit or is that like, no, that's just a Q4 thing? That's all. Thanks.\nMarcos Gabriel: Yes, we're going to be talking more about our digital transformation journey at the Investor Day, Rob. And in Q4, particularly around continuing to drive investments that can sustain our top line performance, digital marketing is one of them that we're going to be continuing to do that in Q4 particularly and others as I mentioned in the call. So it's too early to get into specifics for 2025. We're going to impact the long-term plans as part of the Investor Day and we're going to be covering all our digital transformation program at that point.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Great. Cool. See you there. Thank you so much.\nMarcos Gabriel: Okay. See you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. Maybe I'll just clean up a couple of things. The FX no longer being a headwind and also this discrete tax benefit. When you add all that together, is that like an $0.08 benefit versus your prior expectations? You raised guidance by $0.05. I'm just wondering if I'm doing the math right or if it's not material.\nBrendan Foley: Well, there's a lot of circularity in anything when you look at these things with other programs too, incentive comp and things like that. So we've kind of moved it in essence due to the tax reason due to FX kind of that $0.05 really reflects that.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And another question on third quarter, did brand investment increase high single-digit in third quarter similar to your guidance for the year? I don't remember hearing about it in the comments.\nMike Smith: We've talked about this again in halves, Rob. I mean the first half heavy investment. Second half, we talked about moving the dollars up third and the fourth, which we're doing. So we haven't really talked about if it's up quarter-on-quarter.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So just the guidance is for the halves, not for the quarters?\nMike Smith: Well, actually for the year.\nRobert Moskow: For the year overall?\nMike Smith: It gives insight into the half, yes.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then finally, as you head into 2025, it would appear that there's not a lot of room for additional pricing. But I believe that the long-term algo includes some pricing assumptions. And given we've been in this hyperinflation environment for a couple of years, and now it's kind of come to a screeching halt, is there any reason to think that the pricing lever is kind of off for until further notice? And how do you think about that in terms of your long-term algo? Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Rob, I'll open up with maybe a couple of thoughts here and then ask Mike to wrap it up. But in our long-term algorithm, I think, we've always talked about there very well might be a little bit of price in those long-term objectives. I don't think we're in a position to say today like whether or not anything has sort of materially changed in our outlook there. But as we deal with sort of the near end 2024 perspective, I mean, clearly, we've made some decisions there in order to make sure that we get back to healthy top line, sorry, healthy volume growth pretty quickly. Predicting the future from an inflation standpoint or how it will play out pricing, I think, it's a bit challenging unless we're speaking just in broad terms regarding the long-term algorithm. Mike, do you want to add anything there?\nMike Smith: Yes. I think too there's been a lot of focus, deservedly so in things like price gap management this year for us and others. I think of these things as long-term revenue management, category management initiatives, which we've really invested in and continue to drive. And some of the things Marcos talked about in fourth quarter investment continue to get closer to understanding cannibalization of product lines, innovation, how it impacts, what price does. So I think we think we're really close to best-in-class in this area and really going to continue that into next year. So I think you always have to have that pricing tool in your toolbox because commodities may go up or down, freight costs may go up because of the dock price -- the dock strike. We don't know that right now. So you have to have that lever. And we've been really good with our customers about making sure we pass on cost increases versus margin -- keeping margin. And we've been very, I think we won a lot of trust from both our Flavor Solutions and Consumer customers there. And we'll look at that into the future. I'm sure Marcos will carry that banner going forward.\nMarcos Gabriel: What I would add is that, in addition to that, pricing is a lever that will continue to be part of our long-term algo. I mean we have -- we look at P&L holistically right? And we think about our CCI program working for us and it has been working for us over the last so many years, and will continue to work for us in the future. So that is kind of the first lever that we go about is like using the CCI as a way of funding the investments that we need to continue to drive top line growth. So it's always a mix about all these levers about a little bit of pricing, the CCI coming through the top line, it's very important to top line volume coming through. So all those levers, we kind of manage from a more holistic standpoint, I would say.\nRobert Moskow: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A lot of grounds has been covered. I wanted to maybe come back to spices and seasonings in the US if I may. I think you kind of you alluded to your consumption growth outpacing private label in the quarter. But notably didn't necessarily say the category isn't really what we would see in Nielsen either. And I'm wondering if you could talk about kind of the share environment in that category. And maybe outperforming private label, but there are some smaller brands that continue to grow pretty rapidly. And just how you think about the competitive positioning and how maybe the assortment or price points in that category maybe still have some adjustment to do or if there's adjustment needed to respond to some of the smaller brands which are growing.\nBrendan Foley: Adam, from a perspective of that category, what we're seeing right now is we're doing quite nicely especially from a volume perspective across that part of our business. And on checkout whether or not we're growing share in that particular metric. But what we're seeing broadly in the category is, as we have a very broad offering across the category, we think we compete quite well with all different forms of competitors in what is an attractive category for people to enter. And so that is something that I would just give you. We always have sort of dealt with smaller competitors and at the same time private label. So this doesn't feel like we have any sort of really new dynamic going on as we kind of take a look at the performance of the third quarter. What you're seeing is McCormick really focused on capturing what is healthy category growth in the consumer and making sure that we're growing both unit and volume measures across our business. Now we're also growing TDPs or total distribution points, across this part of our, well frankly, across all of our core categories. But we're also seeing a nice distribution point gain across the whole portfolio, so we believe that's also helping us. But these are the perspectives I think I would share right now in terms of our third quarter performance and as we go into the fourth quarter.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up just on cash flow. I know last year there was -- working capital was a big source of cash for the full year. Just year-to-date, it's been a decent sized use of cash. I know fourth quarter is generally a big working capital reversal. Is there an expectation that working capital is a source or use of cash for the full year once the book is closed?\nMike Smith: Yes, fourth quarter is our strongest cash flow quarter, as you know. It's interesting. We talked about some of the drivers of why we're a little short year-to-date versus prior year. One of those drivers is working capital. And Brendan alluded to the port strike, and part of that is due to us, some of our contingency planning that he mentioned to make sure we were ready. So that should naturally hopefully unwind, but we're still expecting a strong cash flow year.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Palmer: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the SG&A step-up here coming in 4Q. Is there a particular segment where we're going to see this most apparently? And I'm really just trying to get kind of operating profit on a segment basis. You got flattish overall, but is there one area where maybe we'll see more growth than the other?\nMarcos Gabriel: Not specifically. It's going to be across both segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, yes.\nThomas Palmer: Okay. Thanks. And on the unconsolidated operations, what maybe the answer is just a little conservatism. But the level of growth this year, close to 50%. I know the comparison is a lot tougher in 4Q. But when we look at the run rate of the past couple of quarters, is there anything notable to call out that could trigger incremental earnings pressure or again, is the reiteration just more with respect to thinking about last year's 4Q being so strong?\nMike Smith: Well, I think it's that and I mentioned before the FX, I mean, the pesos dancing around 20 now versus 17.5 this last year. So that's a pretty material impact as we translate their earnings back to our P&L.\nThomas Palmer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you and thanks to all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. That concludes our conference call for this morning.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin reviewing our financial results, I would like to address Hurricane Helene. Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by this devastating storm. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Now moving to our results. Our third quarter performance is aligned with our expectations, especially as we continue to navigate an evolving and complex consumer landscape. Our results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments in the areas that we believe will drive the most value and improved unit share trends, drive volume growth and capitalize on our advantaged categories. As we have said, McCormick remains a growth company and our investments in 2024 are yielding results that support our confidence in delivering on our top-tier long-term objectives. We're excited to share our strategic roadmap and building blocks that support these long-term objectives at our upcoming Investor Day. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results, focusing on the top line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on consumer trends, highlight some areas of success and the areas that we continue to work on. Mick will then go into more depth on the third quarter financial results and Marcos will review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the third quarter, sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting flat pricing, 1% volume and product mix as well as the impact of our canning divestiture. This quarter, we reached a meaningful milestone by delivering total positive volume growth despite the challenging environment. Our volume trends improved sequentially across both consumer and flavor solutions. Our results to date, coupled with our proven growth plans, fuel our continued confidence in our ability to deliver on the mid to high end of our constant currency sales growth guidance. In our Consumer segment in the Americas, we delivered solid sequential volume improvement for the third consecutive quarter, leading to 1% volume growth. Volume growth reflects our continued focus on accelerating innovation and alignment with consumer trends and expanding distribution. Our pricing reflects the continuation of our price gap management plans to support improved volumes as planned. In EMEA, we continue to drive positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories for the third consecutive quarter. We realized benefits from new product innovation and expanded distribution. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we delivered strong volume-led sales growth as we continue to benefit from the rollout of our new consumer-preferred packaging for our core spices and seasonings portfolio as well as distribution gains. This performance was tempered by China, slightly more than we had originally expected. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the environment in China to remain challenged and this is reflected within our guidance. Marcos will provide more color on this when he covers our outlook for the remainder of the year. Moving to Flavor Solutions. We delivered strong sequential volume improvement, primarily driven by growth in the Americas. In the EMEA, our volume trends were impacted by softness in our QSR customers' volumes. And in Asia Pacific, our results were impacted by the timing of customer promotions. From a profitability perspective, we delivered strong results relative to the prior year, as the third quarter benefited primarily from the timing of investments, which are shifting to the fourth quarter. As we look at the second half of the year, operating income results remained largely in line with our expectations and earnings per share results are slightly ahead due to a discrete tax item benefit. Let me now share our view on the state of the consumer, which has remained similar since we reported our second quarter results. Overall, consumers are resilient, but remain challenged. They are exhibiting value-seeking behavior making more frequent trips to the grocery store with smaller baskets and shopping just for what they need. They are also focused on reducing waste and stretching their budgets. Foodservice traffic remains soft across most restaurant types, particularly in QSRs. These trends are starting to benefit growth in food at home and this shift is driven by older generations as well as lower income households. Consumers overall continue to cook at home and they are increasingly shopping the perimeter for protein and produce. This further reinforces their demand for flavor and McCormick's categories, included spices and seasonings as well as condiments and sauces. Flavor is not something consumers are willing to sacrifice. Spices and extracts remain the number one center store growth category. From a value perspective, we are seeing several trends. Demand for larger sizes remains elevated. At the same time, there is increased demand for small or trial sizes as well as onetime use recipe mixes, highlighting that flavor exploration remains important to consumers and our plans need to match that demand with the right product offering. Gen Z, our new and future customers, are also cooking at home. They're interested in seasoning blends that make cooking easier and convenient. Interestingly, they are leaning into higher quality and premium flavor items. We're seeing velocity pick up on our gourmet line and it's coming from Gen Z as they seek to recreate restaurant quality meals. As we step back and reflect on all these trends, it reinforces the importance of our consumer-centric mindset, which is present across our entire business. It's at the heart of everything that we do at McCormick. We are strengthening our broad portfolio to meet evolving consumer demands and delighting them with innovation. And we believe we have the right plans in place that are continually informed by what matters most to our consumers and customers. Moving to Slide 5. Let me highlight for the quarter some of the key areas of our success. In our Global Consumer segment, we drove solid unit consumption growth in spices and seasoning across our key markets in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. In the US, we continue to improve on our competitiveness relative to private label as our volume consumption outpaced private label for spices and seasonings this quarter. This quarter, our grilling portfolio outpaced category growth on unit sales, displays, velocity and distribution. And in the fourth quarter, we are excited to begin the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for Grill Mates, ahead of next year's grilling season. In recipe mixes, we continue to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas, driving both unit and volume share and outpacing private label in the US. Our Cholula line continues to be a significant driver of growth. We are innovating with Cholula recipe mixes, bringing new consumers to the category, particularly with millennials and younger families. In EMEA, recipe mixes were a significant driver of UK volume growth and realized dollar market share gains for two consecutive quarters. In Mustard, we had a strong quarter as we drove both unit and volume share in the Americas. In addition, our unit and volume growth outpaced private label in the US. In Poland, mustard consumption continues to grow and we are realizing unit and dollar market share gains. We made great progress over the last two quarters and are pleased to see that our plans are driving the expected improvement. In Americas Consumer, the declines we previously experienced in the prepared food categories that we participate in like Frozen and Asian, which represent a small part of our portfolio, have now stabilized, and we are seeing improved growth. We continue to make progress on total distribution points. We expanded TDPs and gained TDP share in spices and seasonings, recipe mixes and mustard in the Americas. Finally, in the Americas and EMEA, we drove double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, outpacing the market. E-commerce was a significant driver of our unit consumption growth for the quarter as consumers continue to seek convenience. In Flavor Solutions, we saw strength in both of our technically insulated high-margin product categories, branded foodservice and flavors. In Americas branded foodservice business, despite softness in the overall foodservice market, we grew volumes and expanded points of distribution across spices and seasonings and condiments. In addition, we are winning hot sauce tabletop share behind new distribution, packaging and promotion. In Flavors, our consumer packaged food customers are seeing some improvement in volumes within their own business in both the Americas and EMEA. In the Americas, our performance with high-growth innovator customers remained strong. We delivered solid growth in Performance Nutrition beverages as well as alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, outpacing category growth. Let me now touch on some areas where we're seeing some pressure. In Hot Sauce, we continue to have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our share trends remain impacted by a peer that is lapping their own supply chain disruptions. In the Americas, our unit share trends improved sequentially. However, volumes are impacted by mini trial sizes. We are pleased so far with the performance of Frank's minis. Minis are incremental to the category and are driving trial of our new flavors. We expect our innovation, expanded distribution and brand marketing to help improve our trends as we exit 2024. In Flavor Solutions, our volumes were impacted by slower QSR traffic, particularly in EMEA. We have seen this pressure impact our results for several quarters. It's difficult to predict QSR traffic. However, we are collaborating with our customers as they focus on improving their volumes through innovation and value aligned with consumer trends. In Asia Pacific, volume was soft as was impacted by slower QSR traffic outside of China, most notably in Australia and Southeast Asia, where some of our customers remain impacted by geopolitical boycotts. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season. With our promotion and innovation plans, we are well positioned entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels, supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns and are expecting a strong holiday season. Before I wrap up, let me reiterate our growth plans on Slide 6, which support our performance year-to-date and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and into 2025. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories. We have several initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. And I look forward to sharing more details on these plans at our upcoming Investor Day. To wrap up, let me share three key points. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continue to be strong. And importantly, consumer interest in cooking remains strong. We are dedicated to accelerating our volume trends. We refine and adapt our plans as needed and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to sustainable volume-led growth. You should continue to expect improvement as we close the year and into 2025 and beyond. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now over to Mike. Thank you, Marcos. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 24. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, especially as it marks an inflection point for total company volumes turning positive. This demonstrates that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value and reinforces our confidence in our plans and long-term objectives. We continue to execute on our strategic roadmap with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer trends, further capitalizing on our attractive categories across segments. In addition, our plans are yielding the expected results. We also continued to expand margins and manage our costs as we are investing in the business. These improvements are led by our favorable product mix and cost savings programs. Our results in the third quarter benefited from the timing of these investments and we continue to expect our second half operating profit results to be in line with our expectations. Our year-to-date performance coupled with our growth plans give us confidence in achieving the mid to high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions, particularly as we navigate this complex environment and reiterate my confidence that together we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now for your questions. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Let me just maybe lead in with a couple of opening thoughts here. I mean, we do continue to make the right progress, and we're on track with where we expected to be. We turned the corner in our growing volume, which was obviously as we started the year, our goal in the second half of the year. I think importantly, we're outperforming private label and volume across all of our core categories and I do like the progress that we're making in Flavor Solutions especially in this last quarter in the Americas region. Having said that, we're never going to be satisfied. So I think that we still see an opportunity to continue strengthening our plans and execution in the back, the rest of '24 going into '25. But our programs are working and we believe they're delivering the growth that we thought that they would. Just to add context on all those levers that on top of that price gap management that you referred to that we think are really driving our business. It is increased investment in brand marketing and A&P just across all of our core categories. We've launched innovation that's really contributed meaningfully to our performance. And that's been an exciting part because that's a lot more innovation that we launched in 2022 and 2023 which was an important goal that we had here in '24. We're expanding distribution in our core categories. I think we had a really good quarter there in terms of performance as we expected it would start to build. And in terms of pricing, we maintain that price gap management program that we've talked about in the third quarter. It will continue to play out as expected in the fourth quarter too, but it's only a portion of our strategy, but it is yielding I think the results that we expected from that. And I just would add, we're also operating in great categories. So let's not forget that that's also part of the, I think, the strength behind our businesses that we do operate in really strong categories. I do want to say broadly at a global level, we also saw really good performance across the consumer segment at a global level, definitely in EMEA, Australia, Southeast Asia, we just saw broadly good performance, including our spices and seasonings category growing volume across the entire consumer segment for McCormick. Having said all of that, I think our guidance is appropriate, given the dynamic consumer environment. So we're confident in our plans and we will be at that mid to high end of our top line range. But we also have to really, I think, make sure that we reflect what's going on in the environment right now. Hey, China is slightly worse than we expected and it does remain challenging. So we're factoring that into our thinking. QSR trends continue to be a bit uncertain. And so that's kind of factored into our thinking too. And as we go into the fourth quarter, as all of you know, this is the biggest part of the year for us. So we want to make sure that we're balanced and we deliver on our expectations, but it is a big quarter for us. Yes. I think and that certainly bridges off of our second quarter call. More or less, our customer plans were performing as expected, which was, we were expecting some improvement compared to the second quarter. And so we believe that largely did start to play out. Our Flavors business in the Americas region, we saw good results across those areas that we consider like high innovator growth customers. So that plays out in categories like Performance Nutrition or alcoholic beverages or nonalcoholic beverages, but we believe we outperformed the category broadly there. And then we did see strength in our branded foodservice business. And that also played into, I think, some of the improvement that we're seeing broadly across Flavor Solutions, the segment. Having said that, QSR traffic was weak and slower than probably we would have expected, but that's speaking back again to that level of uncertainty. However, having said that, we do see our customers being responsive to what's going on in the market and trying to drive volume growth et cetera. So we do think as we go into Q4, that trend should continue broadly that we see sequential improvement from the third quarter. Great. Well, that last follow-up question, I like to have maybe a few buried in there. So I'm going to do my best to remember everything, but I'm going to ask Mike and Marcos to help me out with this. Yes, we're not prepared to talk about '25 guidance at this point. So although in Investor Day, we feel like we'll share more context about how we're looking at the future and how we think about overall performance and what will drive our long-term volume growth, which is something that we've historically done. And so we'll spend some time talking about our view into what will be those drivers as we look from a long-term perspective. And when I think about what's going well in '24 and why should it continue in '25, it's just we believe that these are the right programs and the right things to do in our business. And these are things that we believe is part of just doing a good job and delivering growth within our categories. Mike, do you want to add anything else on the EPS question? Yes, that's right. Good morning, Peter. And you'll hear us today talk about Investor Day about 10 times, but this heat investments that we're making in supply chain, I think you'll be excited to see the potential, as we've talked about in the past on heat, but it's really driving a lot of our growth, which is great. Sure, Peter. On China, we do expect the environment there. It's going to remain broadly challenged. And we do expect our business probably to be down slightly in '24. So just for the sake of clarity, I mean, that's the outlook that we're looking at for the balance of our year. But when you reference, I think, this latest news on stimulus, I'm just not in a position to sort of predict the impact of that. I will say though in previous actions that have been taken in terms of in the country regarding stimulus, I don't know that they've necessarily had a material impact on our sort of the consumption in our business. And so at this moment, right now, we believe that they'll just continue to make sequentially good progress. It's just not the speed we thought it might happen. And by the way, we didn't plan on a lot, I think, this year in China to begin with. So it's just a little bit, it's more muted than we expected. And I think given the latest economic news out of the country, we're still waiting to see what kind of impact that might have. Good morning. Alexia, to give you a flavor of that, just to repeat the pun a little bit. The drivers on Branded Foodservice have less to do with traffic trends. In fact we see them quite subdued still at this point in time, and they have been for the last even in the second quarter when we reported, we saw just depressed trends from a traffic perspective in most sort of segments within foodservice. The driver of our growth seems to be or it is gaining share, gaining more tabletop placements on things like Frank's RedHot. And just broadly, I think winning in the marketplace with our full platform of both spices and seasonings and also condiments and sauces. And so we like the programs that we drive and that we run. And often what you'll see, I think, in that business is we're doing a lot of limited time offers with our brands. So brands like Cholula or Frank's RedHot tend to be brands that we've seen operators like to use as leverage as ways of driving interest and excitement on their menu because those are obviously flavors that are quite appealing to consumers. And so we're seeing that part of our Branded Foodservice business pick up even a little bit more because we've been running a lot more of those types of programs and promotions with our customer base. So it's really doing well in a tough marketplace, I think, is broadly the answer I would give. Yes. Max, yes, thank you for the question on hot sauce. Hot sauce is an attractive category. There's new competition always entering the category. So that's something that we sort of deal with all the time. And but we as I said in the prepared remarks, we really do like the underlying health of our base business and just continued strong consumer loyalty. And this is also part of our portfolio that's also receiving a fair amount of increased investment. But there is one thing that's really, I think, impacting from a share perspective, just two particular things going on in the marketplace. A peer of ours is lapping a big supply chain constraint from the prior year, which hasn't affected our business as much, but definitely affect theirs. And so we're seeing that volume return back under their label. But also, we're seeing a lot of surge in unit volume from these mini trial sizes, which we were able to participate in or begin to participate in the third quarter. Our units are holding up well in this category too. So there is a fair amount of noise going on in the hot sauce category. And so when we look at those minis, just to give you some more perspective around that, we're seeing a lot of pickup in velocity. What it's doing is it's helping us drive trial on new flavors. I think we have sriracha in there, and we also have a creamy buffalo sauce. Both were super good. But at a dollar, these are really low price points for consumers to just really, it lowers the barrier to trial. And so we've seen a nice pickup in velocity on those mini trial sizes and expect that obviously to be a positive part of our portfolio or that brand assortment that we'll have moving forward. I also do want to draw attention to. We have strongly acceptance on our overall innovation like our Frank's RedHot Squeeze products that are coming out, Frank's Dill Pickle Hot Sauce. These are items from an innovation perspective and then kind of rolling out in the market in the back half of this year and we like the performance that we've seen there. So we'll continue to work through that. We believe we'll have better performance as we move towards the end of 2024 sequentially improved versus the third quarter. But this is an area that we get a lot of attention to and it's an exciting area in the store. Good morning, Steve. Well, when you think about the fourth quarter and our posture walking into the fourth quarter, I think maybe a good way to think about it is, we still have the same level of programs and activity that's been driving our business results. And we expect that will continue in its strength going into the fourth quarter. So we're not pulling back or anything like that. But we like the progress and the results that we're getting across the portfolio with those investments and those plans and programs. It's also our big holiday season quarter. And we really do believe we have very strong holiday plan setup with our customers. And so this is an area that we expect to have really good performance in the holiday. And so that obviously is a tick up when you think about it sequentially from the third quarter and that's something to be expected. Thanks for the question on this, Steve. On the East Coast port strike, from an inbound supply planning perspective for us, we've been contingency planning on this on the potential for this since like April of this year. We really have been thinking about this as maybe something that could happen. And so we've been planning our actions around that possibility. We've also coordinated mitigation plans with our domestic suppliers because they might be counting on inbound supply coming from outside the United States. So we believe we've mitigated most of those risks with the strike now officially occurring. But we believe we're broadly covered. We are monitoring it daily, though, just to make sure that we don't have any interruption of supply, but we feel like we planned for this. Overall, though, we encourage both sides to work through this as productively as they can and with pace because this is something obviously that we don't want to see have a long extended event. But that -- those were our thoughts right now on that and we're going to watch it closely like everyone else. Well, there's a lot of circularity in anything when you look at these things with other programs too, incentive comp and things like that. So we've kind of moved it in essence due to the tax reason due to FX kind of that $0.05 really reflects that. Rob, I'll open up with maybe a couple of thoughts here and then ask Mike to wrap it up. But in our long-term algorithm, I think, we've always talked about there very well might be a little bit of price in those long-term objectives. I don't think we're in a position to say today like whether or not anything has sort of materially changed in our outlook there. But as we deal with sort of the near end 2024 perspective, I mean, clearly, we've made some decisions there in order to make sure that we get back to healthy top line, sorry, healthy volume growth pretty quickly. Predicting the future from an inflation standpoint or how it will play out pricing, I think, it's a bit challenging unless we're speaking just in broad terms regarding the long-term algorithm. Mike, do you want to add anything there? Adam, from a perspective of that category, what we're seeing right now is we're doing quite nicely especially from a volume perspective across that part of our business. And on checkout whether or not we're growing share in that particular metric. But what we're seeing broadly in the category is, as we have a very broad offering across the category, we think we compete quite well with all different forms of competitors in what is an attractive category for people to enter. And so that is something that I would just give you. We always have sort of dealt with smaller competitors and at the same time private label. So this doesn't feel like we have any sort of really new dynamic going on as we kind of take a look at the performance of the third quarter. What you're seeing is McCormick really focused on capturing what is healthy category growth in the consumer and making sure that we're growing both unit and volume measures across our business. Now we're also growing TDPs or total distribution points, across this part of our, well frankly, across all of our core categories. But we're also seeing a nice distribution point gain across the whole portfolio, so we believe that's also helping us. But these are the perspectives I think I would share right now in terms of our third quarter performance and as we go into the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Today's earnings call is bittersweet for me as it marks my last one as CFO of this incredible company before I retire. Reflecting on my tenure of more than three decades, I am filled with immense pride and gratitude for our entire team and appreciate all of their contributions and efforts over the years. Lastly, I would like to thank all of you, our sell-side analysts and investors, for your time and engagement over the years. Your thoughtful questions and insights have been invaluable to me, and they reflect your commitment to understanding our business and long-term strategy. Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. Starting on Slide 8, our top line sales were comparable to the third quarter of last year, including the impact of the canning divestiture and reflect 1% volume growth, partially offset by pricing. In our Consumer segment, sales were comparable with the prior year as the 1% impact of pricing investments was offset by 1% volume growth, reflecting solid sequential improvement from the second quarter. On Slide 9, consumer sales in the Americas were comparable with the prior year. This reflects 1% volume growth offset by pricing investments and this volume growth was driven by our core categories. We continue to take a surgical and data-driven approach to managing price gaps and our investments are still expected to impact about 15% of our Americas consumer segment. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 3%, driven by volumes of 4%, partially offset by pricing of 1%. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were flat, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we delivered volume-led growth that was broad-based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 12. Third quarter constant currency sales were comparable to the prior year, reflecting a contribution from price, which was fully offset by a 1% impact of the divestiture of the canning business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales increased 3%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price and a 2% increase in volume, driven by the timing of customer activities as well as strength in branded foodservice. In the EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 9%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business, lower volume and product mix of 5%, reflecting the impact of QSR customers volumes and lower price of 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales were comparable in constant currency with minimal contributions from both price and volume. As Brendan mentioned, our volumes in APAC were impacted by slower QSR traffic outside of China, most notably in Australia and Southeast Asia, where some of our customers remain impacted by geopolitical boycotts. This was offset by growth in China due to QSR customer promotions. As seen on Slide 16, gross profit margin expanded by 170 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by favorable mix within our Flavor Solutions segment and the impact of our comprehensive continuous improvement program or CCI. Now moving to Slide 17. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A decreased relative to the third quarter of last year, driven by lower distribution costs generated by our CCI program and lower employee-related benefit expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 15% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 or 16% in constant currency, with gross margin expansion and lower SG&A expenses both contributing. Operating profit benefited from a shift in the timing of our investments, which now will be reflected in our fourth quarter results. Marcos will address this shortly when he reviews our outlook for the remainder of the year. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment increased 8% with minimal impact from currency. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 31% or 32% in constant currency, reflecting our continued focus on restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments to fuel top line growth. And touching on tax. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 16.8% compared to 21.4% in the year-ago period. The tax rate benefited from the resolution of an outstanding tax matter dating back several years as well as our state sales mix. As a result, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the year, which is slightly better than the 22% rate we had previously provided and reflects the discrete items I just discussed. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. It is important to note that in the fourth quarter, we will be lapping strong results in the prior year period for McCormick de Mexico. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 20, third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 as compared to $0.65 for the year ago period. This increase was primarily due to our increased operating profit as well as the discrete tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. With that, let me turn the call over to Marcos, who will cover our balance sheet and outlook for 2024. Good morning. Yes. This is Mike. Yes, as we said in the last call, there's a bit of a positive that was going to come into the third quarter from Q2 and that happened. It wasn't the biggest you know Brendan talked about the really good Flavor Solutions underlying performance and Branded Foodservice and other areas. But that did have a positive impact in Q3, which will kind of normalize in Q4 as we think about year-on-year comparisons. Yes, I would just add too, as we, if you go back to guidance early or late in January in CAGNY, the things we talked about making investments this year to really drive the second half volume growth, which we're attaining. We're happy with the performance, not totally satisfied, as Brendan said. We'd love to do more, but build that momentum into 2025. There's uncertainty in the economic market, as there always is, but we feel like we're well positioned. And I think you'll hear more from Investor Day, which would be in three weeks. Yes. If you think about it and some perspective here, we talked about this year in half a lot, first half, second half. And because, as you know, a quarter can such a small unit of measure, sometimes you get some moves. But so we try to keep it pretty high level in half this year. And we've seen really good sequential improvement first half into second half. And actually, by quarter, it's gone that way too. We see the fourth quarter actually higher gross margin than the third quarter, which is our normal trend. So we're really happy with that. Year-on-year, you always get a little mix sometimes that happens. We talk about normalizing mix versus last year in the Flavor Solutions side, not necessarily from third to fourth quarter, but from fourth quarter of this year to last year. Marcos highlighted some of the supply chain investments and I'll let him talk about that in a second. And there's a slight pricing quarter year-on-year comparison there that puts a little bit of pressure, not a whole lot. But why don't you talk a little bit about that? Good morning. Yes, Alexia. You think about our long-term journey on Flavor Solutions and we've talked about portfolio migration in the past and more recently. And as you think about the things that are higher margin within that portfolio, Branded Foodservice, as Brendan mentioned, had a really good quarter gaining share, driving growth some of the categories within flavors, which we're gaining share in Performance Nutrition and things like that again lean to the higher margin side of things. So it's a little indication of a proof point of our vision to move these margins higher as we migrate the portfolio. Considering with the CCI, as someone mentioned CCI before again another bedrock. We've taken you know we approved Flavor Solutions margins in the last two years through our CCI and our global operating effectiveness program, continue that CCI journey there. We'll talk about that more at Investor Day too. So, yes, I think we're very positive on Flavor Solutions longer term. Quarter-to-quarter, it's going to, we've talked about this business sometimes being lumpy. I think we've got to come up with another word since I'll be leaving, but volatile. But again there is a room for margin improvement here. Thanks. Yes, I'd say it's more balanced, honestly. I mean again quarter-to-quarter, you're going to get some variability here. If you look back at the fourth quarter last year, as I mentioned before, the kind of compare and mix, it's normalizing. Supply chain investments, I think, honestly, if you think about it, supply chain investments, the things we're doing on heat Marcos talked about, impact Flavor Solutions. It's a smaller sales base too, so you probably get more of a gross margin impact. But for the year, going back to your comment, we're on plan. We're happy with the margin improvement there. But some of this, as you mentioned, every day we talked about Frank's RedHot Sauce early in the year turning that on every day, so that's a change we made earlier this year. Yes, I think you kind of walked the P&L very well highlighting kind of the squeeze there. We talked about the SG&A investments we're making and that was a timing shift in some of the supply chain investments. Just to touch on tax and unconsolidated really briefly and I'll let Marcos then cover a little bit of the other stuff. But the tax, so a little bit of a headwind after some pretty large favorables that we talked about in the call, which were more timing related, but we did call the tax rate down for the whole year by 1%. But unconsolidated, really great performance by McMex continues. We're lapping a really great performance in the fourth quarter of last year, but also the pace that hits the value pretty significantly. So I think that's part of the reason that it may look wonky to you on that line. But maybe I'll turn it to Marcos to talk a little bit more about the P&L. I think the other thing, Rob, I mean, if you get to the fourth quarter, again, it's one quarter out of four. It's the biggest quarter. Again, it's a little bit of a squeeze play. So we've already, in essence, narrowed the sales by going mid to high earlier in the year, we've kind of said zero to 1% in essence. We've never gone below 1% of the spread in the fourth quarter. So it's just you get a little bit into that, you get a math exercise. So the range is maybe a little bit more than you'd like. But I think you've understood that in the past. We've talked about this again in halves, Rob. I mean the first half heavy investment. Second half, we talked about moving the dollars up third and the fourth, which we're doing. So we haven't really talked about if it's up quarter-on-quarter. Well, actually for the year. It gives insight into the half, yes. Yes. I think too there's been a lot of focus, deservedly so in things like price gap management this year for us and others. I think of these things as long-term revenue management, category management initiatives, which we've really invested in and continue to drive. And some of the things Marcos talked about in fourth quarter investment continue to get closer to understanding cannibalization of product lines, innovation, how it impacts, what price does. So I think we think we're really close to best-in-class in this area and really going to continue that into next year. So I think you always have to have that pricing tool in your toolbox because commodities may go up or down, freight costs may go up because of the dock price -- the dock strike. We don't know that right now. So you have to have that lever. And we've been really good with our customers about making sure we pass on cost increases versus margin -- keeping margin. And we've been very, I think we won a lot of trust from both our Flavor Solutions and Consumer customers there. And we'll look at that into the future. I'm sure Marcos will carry that banner going forward. Yes, fourth quarter is our strongest cash flow quarter, as you know. It's interesting. We talked about some of the drivers of why we're a little short year-to-date versus prior year. One of those drivers is working capital. And Brendan alluded to the port strike, and part of that is due to us, some of our contingency planning that he mentioned to make sure we were ready. So that should naturally hopefully unwind, but we're still expecting a strong cash flow year. Well, I think it's that and I mentioned before the FX, I mean, the pesos dancing around 20 now versus 17.5 this last year. So that's a pretty material impact as we translate their earnings back to our P&L."

            "name": "Marcos Gabriel",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. On Slide 22, we'll summarize highlights for our cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first nine months of 2024, our cash flow from operations was $463 million compared to $660 million in 2023. The benefit from the increasing earnings year-over-year was more than offset by the impact of cash used for working capital, increased incentive compensation payments and timing of cash tax payments. We returned $338 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $189 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, return a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to strong investment grade rating and expect our leverage ratio to be below three times for 2024 with another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 23. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are now expected to have a minimal impact on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a change from the previously anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1% and anticipate our results will be at the mid to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we anticipate about a 1% increase for the year, similar to what we said last quarter. In China, our food away from home business, which is included in APAC consumer, continues to be impacted by lower demand. And we now expect China consumer sales to be down slightly compared to 2023 for the full year, while we presently expect it to be flat, and this is reflected within our guidance. While we recognize there has been continued weak demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term trajectory of the China business. Moving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. In addition to our gross margin expansion, SG&A benefits from cost savings will be partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. For the year, we continue to expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single-digits, reflecting a double-digit increase in investment partially offset by CCI savings. In terms of tax, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the year, which is slightly better than the 22% rate we had previously provided and reflects the benefit of discrete items Mike mentioned earlier. We continue to expect mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico for the year. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.85 to $2.90 reflects a 5% to 7% increase compared to 2023 and we anticipate our results will be close to the high end of the range as we benefit from the improved tax rate. As we head into the fourth quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes to consider. We expect to drive volume growth in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions and sequential improvement from the third quarter. Pricing is expected to have a slight negative impact with the price investments in our Consumer segment, only partially offset by Flavor Solutions. We expect gross margins to sequentially improve from the third quarter and to be flat relative to the prior year, driven by price a comparable year-over-year Flavor Solutions product mix and planned supply chain investments to support growth. We expect our investments in brand marketing to ramp sequentially from the third quarter and anticipate an increase in SG&A year-over-year related to IT and digital transformation investments shifting into the fourth quarter and I will talk more about these investments at our upcoming Investor Day. As a result, our operating profit will likely be comparable with the prior year due mostly to the time of our investment. However, this remained largely in line with how we had expected our operating profit to perform for the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results. Our return to volume light growth underscores that we are moving in the right direction and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2024 financial outlook and long-term objectives over time. Yes. So you think about the gross margin and the puts and takes between Q3 and Q4. We're thinking about Q4 as more of a normalized Flavor Solutions product mix than Q3. So we think about it that way. We're also thinking about some of the supply chain investments that we had planned for the year around building capacity, particularly around the heat platform that we have continued to invest in the platform will be impacting Q4 more so than the rest of the year. So that is an impact there. And also, I would say that in a little of pricing, we're going to have a slightly negative pricing in consumer going into Q4 offset by partially offset by Flavor Solutions, but there's going to be a little bit of that negative impact through pricing as we continue to invest back in the business to drive top line growth. So there are some elements between Q3 and Q4. As Mike said, some puts and takes between the two quarters. I think if you look at the second half profitability it's very much in line with what we expected before. And also just add to that, Mike, for me as we continue to grow the business, we'll see leverage coming through the P&L and that is also going to impact our margins going forward. But overall, I mean, our operating profit should -- margin should improve for the full year versus last year. So we are going to continue to make that sequential improvement in terms of operating margin. So we've increased margins by 200 basis points 2023 versus 2022 and that will continue to drive operating margin up for the full year as we had planned before. Yes, yes. So we talked about the top line, I mean, sequentially improving from Q3 into Q4. We gave the mid to high double the range in terms of the full year. But that means if you think about Q4, it's going to improve both in Consumer and Flavor Solutions from Q3. The same applies to gross margin. Even gross margin is going to continue to improve sequentially from Q3 into Q4. If you compare with prior year, it's going to be flat, given the reasons that I mentioned before in terms of the investments that we're making in supply chain, the normalization of the mix a bit on the Flavor Solutions side, and some of the pricing that within Consumer that's going to be partially offset by Flavor Solutions. So that's how we see the gross margin coming into Q4. On SG&A, we had some investments that shifted from Q3 to Q4 as well, particularly around IT and digital transformation. As you know, we have a digital transformation journey across the company. I'm going to be commenting more about that at the Investor Day. But we see some investments in Q4 around digital marketing. In terms of data analytics, we are putting a hub around data analytics to serve the business as well as some efficiencies across manufacturing. Some of the investments that we're making in terms of digital transformation that is really kind of a lending in Q4. So that's a little bit of that impact that you see. But operating profit is going to be comparable to last year, so for Q4. And those are kind of the puts and takes that we see from Q3 to Q4. Yes, we're going to be talking more about our digital transformation journey at the Investor Day, Rob. And in Q4, particularly around continuing to drive investments that can sustain our top line performance, digital marketing is one of them that we're going to be continuing to do that in Q4 particularly and others as I mentioned in the call. So it's too early to get into specifics for 2025. We're going to impact the long-term plans as part of the Investor Day and we're going to be covering all our digital transformation program at that point. Okay. See you. What I would add is that, in addition to that, pricing is a lever that will continue to be part of our long-term algo. I mean we have -- we look at P&L holistically right? And we think about our CCI program working for us and it has been working for us over the last so many years, and will continue to work for us in the future. So that is kind of the first lever that we go about is like using the CCI as a way of funding the investments that we need to continue to drive top line growth. So it's always a mix about all these levers about a little bit of pricing, the CCI coming through the top line, it's very important to top line volume coming through. So all those levers, we kind of manage from a more holistic standpoint, I would say. Not specifically. It's going to be across both segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, yes."

To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Marcos Gabriel, Senior Vice President, Global Finance and Capital Markets. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statement on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter performance, particularly as we continue to navigate a changing and complex consumer landscape. Our differentiated results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments to accelerate volume trends and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. McCormick remains a growth company, and 2024 continues to be an important investment year. As planned, as we have activated many of our initiatives and we are starting to see results that support our confidence in delivering on our long-term objectives. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our second quarter results focusing on the top-line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some areas of success as well as areas we continue to work on, and review our growth plans with a focus on innovation. Mike will then go into more depth on the second quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the second quarter, sales declined by 1% in constant currency, reflecting flat pricing, and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Volume growth in our Consumer segment was offset by declines in Flavor Solutions related to softness in some of our quick serve restaurant, or QSR, and packaged food customers volumes as well as the timing of customer activities, as expected. Although certain parts of our Flavor Solutions business are pressured, given our collaboration and strong innovation pipeline with our customers, we expect volume trends to improve during the second half of the year. In our Consumer segment, volumes improved substantially from the first quarter across our major markets and delivered volume growth. In the Americas, we delivered solid sequential volume improvement for three consecutive quarters, and our pricing in the second quarter reflects the activation of our price gap management plans to support improved volumes in the second half, as planned. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories for the second consecutive quarter. We expanded distribution in the grocery, discounter and e-commerce channels, and realized benefits from new product innovation. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we delivered strong volume-led sales growth, as we executed the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for our core spices and seasonings portfolio and realized distribution gains. This performance was tempered by China as expected, although sequentially volume trends improved in China. Results in our Consumer business reflect continued focus on increased brand marketing investments, accelerating innovation in alignment with consumer trends, and expanding distribution. Let me now share our current view on the state of the consumer. Consumers continue to exhibit value seeking behavior. Financial anxiety remains elevated, particularly in the United States, and especially with mid- to low-income households due to the compounding impact of inflation. In addition, inflation in the foodservice channel is leading to softness in food away-from-home consumption and impacting restaurant traffic, particularly with QSRs across many of our regions. Volumes on the retail side, particularly in the center of store, remained soft. Consumers continue to buy just for what they need and make more frequent trips to the store. On the other hand, they are increasingly shopping the perimeter and continuing to cook at home. Certain categories such as spices and seasonings as well as condiments and sauces are seeing a benefit amid these trends. As consumers are looking to stretch their budgets, our categories represent a fraction of the cost relative to proteins, produce, and carbs and drive the majority of the flavor. In fact, in the second quarter, spices and seasonings was the top category in center store growth across measured channels. And McCormick is the leading branded player and driving category unit growth. What continues to differentiate McCormick is that we operate in great categories across all channels. We offer products at every price point, from premium to lower price points. We have a broad and diversified portfolio to meet evolving consumer demands. We are part of the solution for consumers. Importantly, we believe that we have the right plans in place that are continually informed by what matters most to our consumers and customers. Moving to Slide 5, let me highlight for the quarter some of the key areas of our success. For our global Consumer segment, including the Americas, our core categories delivered solid volume growth. In spices and seasonings, we delivered volume growth across all of our major markets. In the US, our share performance improved, resulting in positive gains in unit share for the quarter. In addition, we drove dollar share gains in France and Eastern Europe. In recipe mixes, we continued to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas, particularly in our Mexican product lines, through our price gap management investments as well as distribution growth. In addition, in EMEA, recipe mixes were a significant driver of UK volume growth and we realized dollar market share gains for two consecutive quarters. In mustard, we are driving improved unit consumption and unit market share trends across our regions. In the Americas we expanded distribution and actioned our pricing investments. In addition, innovation is yielding results. Our creamy dill fickle mustard performance is exceeding our expectations. In Poland, mustard consumption continues to grow and we are realizing dollar market share gains, which strengthened from the first quarter. In Flavor Solutions, we had pockets of strength this quarter. In our Americas Branded Foodservice business, despite softness in the overall market, we grew volumes. In our Americas Flavors business, our performance with high-growth innovator customers remained strong. We grew in non-alcoholic beverages and saw continued strength in performance nutrition. In Asia Pacific, including China, we drove strong volume growth as we benefited from new customer products and promotions. Let me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian and Americas consumer. Importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the volume growth in our core categories is beginning to fully offset these declines. In hot sauce, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty, and we continue to invest in our market-leading brands. In the Americas, consumption and share trends improved in the second quarter on top of our first quarter improvement. A couple of short-term items continue to impact our share. First, [as appears] (ph) that is lapping their own supply chain disruptions, and second, new price pack architecture in the form of trial sizes, which have been incremental to the category. As we realize the benefit of our increased innovation, including Frank's new Dip'n sauces and Squeeze bottles, as well as mini trial sizes, A&P investments and distribution expansion, we expect to drive improved hot sauce consumption trends in the second half of 2024. In Flavor Solutions, our volumes were impacted by slower QSR traffic in both EMEA and the Americas. We expect to improve these volume trends as we continue to execute on our growth plans in the second half of the year. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers experienced additional softness in volumes within their own business in both the Americas and EMEA. We are collaborating with our customers to support their innovation plans and we are continuing to diversify our customer base over time. Before moving to our growth plans, I'd like to note that our total US Branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by Circana data and combined with unmeasured channels, outpaced our sales growth this quarter, as our brand investments drove improved consumption and we are lapping the increased shipments that came in ahead of the 2023 pricing actions of the prior year. This is a function of timing from quarter-to-quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on Slide 6, which are supporting our second quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and into 2025. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories, and we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. And I look forward to sharing more details on these plans at our upcoming Investor Day in October. Brand marketing, new products and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies and customer engagement continue to be the levers that drive our growth. For today, I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight one of these levers, innovation, on Slide 7 and 8. First, it's important to recognize that we are one of the few, if not the only company that operates in end to end flavor with both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach. Our shared insights give us a strong understanding of consumers' flavor needs, preferences and trends. And we have the ability to translate this into innovation, making McCormick a global leader in flavor trends and flavor innovation. Innovation is a priority for us. It drives one-third of our long-term algorithm. It meaningfully contributed to our results for the first half of 2024, and we expect it to drive strong performance in the second half. As a management team, we discussed the latest trends and insights and how those might translate into innovation in both segments. We are continuously leading the pursuit of what's next in flavor. In our company, everyone is engaged in innovation. In the first half of the year, our results benefited from new products and packaging and the performance of these launches continues to improve. Importantly, our pipeline for the remainder of the year remains robust. In our Consumer segment, our renovated US everyday urban spice portfolio is fully shipped, and roughly two-thirds of our new packaging is currently on shelf, driving double-digit velocity gains and contributing to our strong volume improvement in spices and seasonings. New products within our spices and seasonings portfolio, including Lawry's new seasoning blends, Flavor Maker blend, and our exciting grilling portfolio of Stubb's rubs and new Grill Mates seasonings blends in partnership with Max the Meat Guy fuel first-half results and are expected to accelerate our performance in the second-half. In fact, in 2024, we are launching nearly 4 times more grilling rubs and seasonings compared to 2023. Importantly, our grilling season, which kicked-off at the end of second quarter is off to a great start. In addition to our grilling blends and rubs, we are excited about early results from Frank's RedHot Dip'n sauce and popular flavors in the Squeeze bottle format that we launched this year. We are energized for the grilling season and expect our [Flame & Flavor] (ph) marketing campaign that launched in the second quarter to drive incremental consumer demand. Our Cholula salsas and recipe mixes that launched in 2023 are driving new buyers to the category and continue to exceed our expectations since launch. Cholula salsas are driving strong incremental category growth with our high repeat buy rates and our Cholula recipe mixes are a top recipe mix brand after just one year in the market. They are driving the second highest unit growth within the category. We continue to build US distribution and we are launching both formats in Canada this year. In EMEA, growth from new product sales is accelerating and we expect it to drive significant growth in the second half of the year. In the UK, across recipe mixes and seasonings, our Schwartz range with Nadiya Hussain, restaurant-branded partnerships and a range of classic American recipe mixes with Frank's, OLD BAY and French's are driving our innovation performance and expanding household penetration with younger consumers. In France, we are collaborating with Juan Arbelaez, a celebrity Colombian French chef, to drive engagement with younger households. And recently we partnered with him to launch a range of unique and delicious Ducros barbecue seasonings in time for the summer barbecue season. Moving now to our Flavor Solutions segment, we continue to leverage our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors, to win new customers, diversify our customer base and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our high-growth innovator and consumer products' customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. As we look to our innovation pipeline that we support for our customers, we expect to pick up in the back half of the year. We are collaborating with many customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages to performance nutrition. Our win rate with heat briefs are strong across our regions and we continue to dedicate resources to where we have the right to win. In Branded Foodservice, our 2023 launches, including Frank's Mild Wings Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot, are delivering strong results in the first half of the year. Our early 2024 launches are also contributing to our growth and include a number of e-products like Grill Mates Fiery Habanero and Cholula Chili Lime. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect new products to meaningfully drive our top-line, and importantly, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching Frank's Garlic Buffalo and Mango Habanero in the Americas, as well as Frank's RedHot Mayo in the UK and France, and we are further extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our Consumer segment into the foodservice channel. Overall, we are very excited about our innovation plans for 2024. We expect new product performance to be in-line with our long-term objectives and to drive a meaningful portion of our volume growth. In addition, in the second half of the year, sales from new products are expected to nearly double compared to the first half, and a meaningful portion of this innovation is in heat. Heat-infused products span our portfolio. Across both segments, we expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for total McCormick. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands, deep consumer insights and our meaningful scale, technology and expertise that we have been building for decades. As we look ahead, we are maintaining our outlook for 2024. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we continue to expect our top-line to be at the mid- to high-end of our guidance range given the momentum we saw in the first half of the year, particularly in our Consumer segment. We are confident in our initiatives and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also remain prudent and continue to reflect the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024. To wrap up, let me reiterate three key points. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continues to be very strong, and importantly, consumer interest in cooking remains strong. We remain dedicated to accelerating our volume trends. We refine and adapt our plans as needed and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to sustainable volume-led growth, and you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now, before Mike's remarks, I'd like to speak to the management transition. As you likely know, last night we announced Mike's decision to retire at the end of February. Mike has been an exceptional leader at McCormick for more than three decades. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving top-tier organic growth as well as our successful acquisition agenda. His deep knowledge of McCormick and effective execution of our CCI initiatives helped fuel our growth investments to deliver profitable growth. Mike is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork. He helped build a world-class global finance team. He will be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Mike, congratulations on your successful career and your upcoming retirement. In the same announcement, Marcos Gabriel was named Executive Vice President and CFO effective December 1. Marcos will serve on our management committee and lead the company's finance organization and global business services team. Marcos is a proven global leader with over 25 years of experience in the consumer products industry. His expertise across major multinational companies in several geographies will be instrumental as we continue to execute our growth plans. I have worked with Marcos over the last seven years. He has served in key senior leadership roles at McCormick, contributing meaningfully to our profitable growth and improved productivity. Marcos, congratulation on this promotion and I look forward to working with you in this new role.\nMarcos Gabriel: Thank you, Brendan. I'm honored to serve as the CFO of McCormick and excited to continue to partner with the entire team to deliver long-term profitable growth and drive shareholder value. It has been great to work closely with Mike and the management committee for the past year to transition into this new role. Mike, I want to thank you for your mentorship and offer my congratulations on your retirement.\nMike Smith: Thanks very much for those remarks, Marcos and Brendan. Joining McCormick more than 30 years ago was one of the best decisions I've ever made. This is a great company and it continues to get better. I am proud of the progress we have made over the years. We significantly grew our top-line, generated fuel for growth through improved productivity and continued to deliver solid results despite the complexity and uncertainty we experienced the last few years. I am so proud of and grateful for our entire team here at McCormick and appreciate all of their contributions and efforts. My decision to retire in February is based in part on Marcos' readiness to move into the role. I've had the privilege of working with him for several years and witnessed his strong financial leadership and ability to drive results. I'm confident that Marcos, in partnership with Brendan and the rest of our leadership team, have the capabilities and vision to continue to advance our leadership and differentiation and capture all the great opportunities that are ahead for McCormick. Lastly, I look forward to partnering with Brendan and Marcos to ensure a smooth transition over the next few months. Now moving to our results for the second quarter. Starting on Slide 11, our top-line constant currency sales declined 1% compared to the second quarter of last year, including the impact of the canning divestiture and reflects flat pricing, offset by a 1% volume and product mix decline. As expected, volume declines were primarily driven by lower customer demand and the timing of customer activities in the Flavor Solutions segment. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 1%, driven by pricing investments. Volumes were slightly positive and reflect a substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter. On Slide 12, Consumer sales in the Americas declined to 2% versus the second quarter of last year. This decline reflects pricing investments of 1% and flat volumes. Volume growth in spices and seasonings was offset by volume declines in prepared food categories, including frozen and Asian. In terms of pricing, we continue to take a surgical and data-driven approach to managing price gaps, and our investments are still expected to impact about 15% of our Americas Consumer segment. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales increased 4%, driven entirely by volume. Sales growth was broad based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through in 2024. Constant currency Consumer sales in the APAC region were down 1%, driven by a 2% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we delivered volume-led growth in the mid-teens that was broad based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 15, second quarter constant currency sales declined 1%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decline in volume and the impact of the divestiture of the canning business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales declined 1%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decrease in volume, driven by the timing of customer activities as well as the softness in quick service restaurant and packaged food customer volumes. This was partially offset by volume growth in our Branded Foodservice business, as Brendan mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 8%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business, lower volume and product mix of 4%, reflecting the impact of QSR and packaged food customers' volumes and the timing of some customer activities. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 10% in constant currency. Volume grew 9%, driven by customers promotions, limited time offers and new products, while pricing contributed 1%. As seen on Slide 19, gross profit margin expanded by 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, driven primarily by the benefit of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, or CCI. As we look ahead, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year. Now, moving to Slide 20. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased versus the second quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing investments, which were partially offset by CCI cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points. As expected, brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results and we can anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts. Adjusted operating income was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 with minimal impact from currency as gross margin expansion was offset by higher SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 3% or 2% in constant currency. While in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 6% with minimal impact from currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the second quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus prior year in this segment. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top-line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 21. Our interest expense was up slightly versus the prior year. The reduction in average debt was more than offset by higher short-term interest rates. And touching on tax, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 22.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant benefit this year. Our second quarter adjusted rate benefited from a discrete tax item, primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an international legal entity reorganization. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the second quarter reflect strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We remain the market leader with our McCormick brand of mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 23, second quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.60 for the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the discrete tax benefit and higher income from unconsolidated operations I just mentioned. On Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2024, our cash flow from operations was $302 million compared to $394 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation payments and the timing of cash tax payments. We returned $226 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $130 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now, turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 25. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top-line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Given the momentum in our first half, we expect to be at the mid- to high-end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we expect the favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, realized primarily in the first quarter to be partially offset by our price gap management investments that will drive volume growth. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect total pricing to be flat relative to the prior year and segment trends are expected to be similar to the second quarter. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize and we continue to expect to return to total volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic headwinds. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio. The impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. In China, our food-away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, was impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect China Consumer sales to be flat to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in that long-term growth trajectory of the China business. Finally, the divestiture of the Giotti canning business will impact us through the third quarter. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low-single digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the UK in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high-single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing be concentrated in the first half of the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in discrete items. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We are moving in the right direction and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2024 financial outlook and long-term objectives over time.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on Slide 26. First-half results and volume performance in the Consumer segment demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantaged categories across segments. We're able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our cost saving programs to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the first half coupled with our growth plans give us confidence in achieving the mid- to high-end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their dedication and their contributions, and reiterate my confidence that together we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now, for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Mike, congratulations to you on your retirement announcement. Glad we have you around for another couple of quarters. And Marcos, congratulations to you on the new role.\nMike Smith: Thank you, Andrew. We'll see you at Investor Day.\nMarcos Gabriel: Thank you, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks. I guess first off, looking at the sequential improvement in volume in the Consumer segment, particularly in the Americas, certainly seems like the investments are starting to yield results. I was hoping maybe you could unpack that for us a bit and speak to the levers that are driving the performance, and what gives you the confidence that that will continue through the back half?\nBrendan Foley: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Just to maybe open up with a couple of points to reinforce, we did have a good quarter and sales do continue to strengthen, which gives us confidence in that mid- to upper-end of our range. But this also includes that short-term weakness that we felt with Flavor Solutions in the quarter. I think one of the important things I want to make sure we get across is that we did drive volume growth in our global Consumer segment. And it does reflect kind of in many ways, I think that additional program that we talked about. We're also driving strong sequential volume improvement in Americas like you just called out in the Consumer business, and specifically in spices and seasonings, we delivered volume growth across all major markets and then included driving unit share growth in the US. So, we said this was a year of investment and we further executed those programs that we've been talking about. And at the same time, we still expanded margins. So, we're pretty pleased with the results at this point. It is a halfway point in the year and we do like the progress that we're making. If I were to add more context and unpacking those levers that we've been talking about on this call and in previous calls, a lot of it is, we did ramp up brand marketing in the first half and it wasn't just in the first quarter. We also saw a significant ramp up in the second quarter, too. And a lot of that investment was going more against our core categories to drive demand and support our initiatives. And we continue to expect healthy levels as we go into the second half of the year on brand marketing. New products was also a big part of that, too, in the first half and it contributed pretty meaningfully, especially a lot of that build happened in the second quarter. I would say, it was more pronounced in the second quarter than even in the first, just because of the build of getting items on shelf and beginning to ship them. And we expect to double that innovation when you compare the second half to the first half. So, that lines up nicely as we go into the balance of the year. And then, we expanded distribution in certain categories. Our new products are gaining strong retail acceptance. And so, that's obviously one of those levers that helps. And in terms of pricing in the second quarter, we activated many of our price gap management programs. And so, we expect this to continue into the second half, because we know the [uplift] (ph) with the performance that we're seeing from that, but it's still only a portion of our strategy. As we said before, it impacts about 15% of our Americas Consumer business, but it is yielding the results that we were expecting to get. And so, all of these growth levers are contributing and driving, I think, really healthy outcomes as we think about the performance of our business. So, by the way, we operate in great categories, too. So, the categories are performing well also. And so that obviously is a nice tailwind as part of that.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks for that. And a quick follow-up. Mike, you had called out some weakness in Flavor Solutions volume several weeks ago. The result today, I guess, was at the sort of more favorable end of that range you provided in terms of Flavor Solutions volume in the quarter. And I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of what the exit rate of sort of volume in Flavor Solutions in the Americas and Europe sort of looked like kind of coming out of fiscal 2Q? Just to get a sense if maybe it sort of weakened from what we saw in the 2Q result or maybe if we can expect some sequential improvement in the US and Europe as we move further into fiscal 3Q? Thank you so much.\nMike Smith: Yes, that's no problem. I mean, we did say on the call, we are expecting some sequential improvement in the Q3 and Q4. There was -- we had talked about that a month ago, low-single digit to mid-single digit. So, we did come in at the low-single digit phase, which we're happy with. We're always happy with those results. As you get down into some of the customer activity timing, which we have more clarity to, some of the partnership that we're working with and getting more information on activities of customers, now some of those are second-half related, some will carry into 2025. So, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we feel good about where that sequential improvement we're seeing in addition to the great consumer performance that Brendan just alluded to.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nPeter Galbo: Congrats, Mike, on your retirement, and congrats to Marcos as well. Maybe just to pick up on Andrew's question just around kind of consumer confidence in the back half of the year, and that acceleration, Brendan, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a bit more -- you're seeing consumer shopping the perimeter of the store relative to center store and maybe that explains why you might be bucking the trend relative to some of your peers. But maybe you could just unpack that a bit more what you're seeing from that consumer perspective and again what kind of drives the confidence as you get into the back half?\nBrendan Foley: Yes, I think what drives our confidence is as we look at our business, at the brand and sort of the key category and unit level, we think the programs are having strong impact, coupled with where we think consumers are moving within the store and what they're doing. As people tend to when they feel like -- if you think about the inflation, food-away-from-home, we're definitely seeing people shift more to eating at home, and that certainly benefits our business as we've always mentioned. But as people shop the perimeter, I think they're looking for opportunities in terms of how they flavor their meals, and so that really does benefit our categories. When I think about broadly though, Peter, just the overall consumer outlook, it hasn't really changed a lot since our last guidance or even on our last call. I mean, we're pretty confident in our initiatives and we think they're working. But our outlook assumes the consumer is kind of where they are, or they have been like in the fourth quarter of '23 and the first half of '24. And so, we continue to take a cautious view on our outlook. I think that just reflects what might be uncertainty or inconsistency that we tend to see in the environment. But we believe even in that environment, we plan for our plants to kind of deliver this type of performance. So, we see the consumer moving around and shifting channels, that's definitely happening, and I think that pops up in the numbers, but it tends to benefit our business, whether it's in foodservice or whether it's at meals-at-home. We're flavoring all those occasions. So, we really believe that when we're -- as an end-to-end provider of flavor, we tend to benefit depending on wherever channel it shifts into.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. And Mike, I think, depending on whether you look at the IRI or -- sorry, the Circana or the Nielsen data, there was maybe a gap just in Americas consumer relative to the -- I think you gave some of the factors, but just anything you can dimension there on kind of the gap in terms of shift to consumption of that?\nMike Smith: Yeah, absolutely. There's a number of factors that kind of impact the difference between our shipments and consumption. And just to give you some context around that, and maybe I'll just share with you three points to kind of consider. First of all, our consumption is strengthening. And if I were to think about how that progressed through the second quarter, I think more of it we saw in the back half of the second quarter than in the front half. So, that would reflect as we started to really get execution of our programs, in retail, we were seeing stronger consumption. So, it started to pull up. In Q2 across the total portfolio, we drove almost a full point of unit growth. And so that gave us reason to feel confident and that includes those declines in prepared foods that we talked about like the frozen and Asian category declines. But it was a substantial improvement from Q1 and driven by that increased programming. I think that is, to some degree, a condition of sales catching up to our performance on shelf. So, as retailers start to see, I think, our movement, we obviously expect sales to keep up with that. I would expect more strengthening to continue in the second half. The other condition that in the second quarter, I think it's important to call out is we were lapping increased shipments that came ahead of the 2023 pricing actions of the prior year. And we also had a similar condition in '22 compared to '23. So that did play a little bit of impact, I think, when we look at shipments versus consumption. And then, in terms of retailers, they're always looking to be more efficient. That's not new. It's always I think a focus of theirs. But overall, we are not seeing at this time any unusual activity. So, I think just to give you a little bit of context on consumption as an impact, what was going on in the prior year and then how our retailers behaving, I think that would be the perspective I would want you to think about with McCormick.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. And Mike and Marcos, congratulations to both of you. And Mike, thank you for all of your help over the years. I know you're not done yet, but it's appreciated. I wanted to ask a little bit about -- you have a pretty confident tone, I think it's fair to say, about the direction of trends into the second half. You beat this quarter on the bottom-line by a decent amount. You beat the first quarter by a decent amount. It sounds like you're implicitly -- well, you are implicitly guiding for the tax rate to be closer to 24% in the second half roughly. I guess putting that all together, were there any thoughts of raising guidance? I realize it's a pretty unpredictable environment right now, but I just want to get a little bit of sense for how you view the second half in terms of -- I'll use the word prudence in relation to just how well the first half performed at least versus external expectations?\nBrendan Foley: Yeah.\nMike Smith: You want to get it?\nBrendan Foley: I'll lead off with a couple of comments, Mike.\nMike Smith: Yeah.\nBrendan Foley: I mean, I do think, Ken, we felt like we did have strong consumer performance and our investments are working and doing what we said we would do. And so that does give us confidence going into the second half and perhaps that's why you're hearing a little bit of confidence in our tone. But given how the first half performed, we expect those growth levers in the consumer part of our business to continue to operate and work well. As we said on Flavor Solutions, we expect sequential improvement versus what we saw in the second quarter, because there's many other things that I think as Mike said earlier in the questions here, it does give us confidence as we think about what how we might look at the Flavor Solutions business. But Mike, if you want to talk a little bit about what drives our prudence probably has to do with the back half is a big part of the year...\nMike Smith: As we think about where we are on the life cycle of the year, and we talked about Q2 being an important quarter for us, because it was the pivot quarter where pricing is -- we lose some of the protection of pricing, which we saw in the first quarter and last year, the shift of volume and particularly what makes us happy is that consumer volume going positive, which is great. There's some back-half assumptions on volume growth in Consumer, which were very -- we know the programs are working, but you still have to assume that the second half of the year is the biggest half and biggest quarter is the fourth quarter. So, while we're really pleased with the results, we realized the second half is important to continue that momentum and we believe we will. We're always looking at the guidance. I mean, you referenced tax, I'm kind of chuckling, because I think my first earnings call, we probably I think we had a big tax adjustment as similar and we talked about guidance for the year versus these things happen lumpily in the quarter or half. So, I'll take that one right off, 24% in the second half because our underlying rate is 24% to 25%, so that's roughly what we'll probably land. I mean, we do have the second half, if you think about built-in operating margin growth, we have volume growth, things like that. So, we feel like we've called it prudently. Obviously, if there's opportunities as things change, we want to keep our financial flexibility to make investments in some of these growth drivers that we're really seeing positive on. So, we want to have that flexibility, too. But I think we're really pleased going into the third quarter. We talked a bit about some of the consumer uncertainty, which impacts some of our Flavor Solutions business. We're always cautious there too, but I'd say we've called it pretty much down the middle with hopefully a lean in to the positive.\nKen Goldman: Sounds good. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning. And congratulations, Mike. And welcome or congratulations, Marcos. I guess, we'll see you both at the Investor Day coming up in October, and thank you. Can I pick up on Andrew's question around Flavor Solutions and maybe think about the longer-term strategies for building resilience in that segment? You have a lot of exposure to QSR, quite focused on one particular customer in the salty snacks segment. Are there plans to diversify? And how quickly can you get off to those new opportunities? And which kinds of categories that are faster growth can you go after?\nBrendan Foley: Alexia, thanks for the question. Good morning. I think as you think about the core of your question is that long-term outlook as you think about our customer space and portfolio of Flavor Solutions, I would go back to things that we've said in prior discussions. If we think about the Flavor Solutions business is constantly in activity of continuing to shape that portfolio to higher value-added products and technologies and customer base. So, as we continue to shape that portfolio, it continues to go in the direction of sort of our flavors business, which includes seasonings as we think about our portfolio. And in many ways, some of the fastest-growing areas of that portfolio happened to be the small, highly-innovative, emerging customers that are operating in categories that like performance nutrition or non-alcoholic beverages, where like this quarter, we continue to see real strength. That is a form of looking at how we diversify our customer base, but we're also operating where we think there are strong areas of growth. And these this really I think is kind of the central point that we've talked about is, we'll continue to shape that part of our -- the Flavor Solutions segment and that portfolio to that higher value-added sort of product and technology sale that we have. And this is, I think, what you see quarter-to-quarter is a reflection of that.\nMike Smith: I think, too, people sometimes forget the branded through service business, which really good margins and we like that portfolio and we're continuing to gain share. We keep coming up with opportunities. We talked about expanding McCormick Mayonesa into that category, things like that. So, there's really lots of opportunities on that side, which we like on the Flavor Solutions side. It's a diversified portfolio. That's I think the message and we continue to diversify and optimize and move toward more higher-margin product lines.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. Could I just do a quick follow-up on the highlights of the remaining cost saving opportunities? You talked a little bit about getting rid of costs that were incremental through COVID. What are the major buckets of cost savings remaining to you over the next couple of years?\nMike Smith: Oh gosh, we could talk the whole earnings call on that one. It means, our CCI program has a long history of generating sustainable cost savings. We talked a little bit on this call about -- we're finalizing the transition to our new UK Flavor Solutions business in the second half, which will give us some tailwind into next year, which is great. But our CCI program -- we target all levels of the P&L. I mean, a lot of times programs will just look at cost of goods sold, raw material, things like that, which is an important part of our portfolio. We're looking at optimizing SG&A. A&P, when we talked about A&P a lot this year, we're actually spending A&P -- our guidance is high-single digits, but from an effectiveness perspective, we're actually spending low double digits and getting CCI savings as we optimize spend to touch more customers more effectively. So, those are examples everywhere along the P&L. I'd say, it's a program that's special because the ideas come from the bottom up in our organization as part of our culture to drive that, because we want to use it as fuel for growth, so we can drive the growth levers that we talked about this year at CAGNY and help drive that volume. So, I think there's a lot more opportunity and I look forward to Marcos helping drive that into the future, too.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteve Powers: Hey, guys. Good morning. And Mike and Marcos, congrats from me as well. So, Brendan, I wanted to talk a little bit about the price gap management initiatives you've put in place in Consumer. With the commentary on year-over-year pricing in the back half expected to resemble what we've seen in the second quarter, it doesn't sound like you expect a whole lot more of incremental unit price investment over the course of the year. And I guess just wanted to kind of test that assumption. And then, in the context of what you were saying around just the value seeking behavior and the consumer financial pressures that you're observing across the consumer landscape, just what gives you the confidence that that kind of -- you've kind of done enough at this point and you've got in place what you need for the duration of the year? Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Steve. I think in the two questions you asked there, let me address your first one first. Yeah, you can make the assumption that as we think about the rest of the year in that price gap management activity, what we've implemented year-to-date largely reflects how we're thinking about carrying through the rest of the year. Having said that, we're looking at performance all the time. And so, we might make tweaks. We might look at the performance of programs and decide whether or not we want to make adjustments. But as we look at it today, we feel like we're positioned for given the performance so far that these programs are operating the way we want them to and should continue into the second half, I think with a strong level of confidence. So, I think just to kind of hit that first area first and how you should think about that program activity. As it relates to the consumer and how they're operating and what might be the way to think about consumer behavior today in the store, I would just maybe add a couple of thoughts there. We have the broadest portfolio in the category, particularly like in spices and seasonings and that really does differentiate us. But what that allows us to do is, we're operating across all channels. We have products at every price point, whether it be premium or lower price points and we even explored like we did with the Lawry's opening price point, launching that item in there was to really take care of another price point area that we felt like we need to operate in. But this broader diversified portfolio allows us to meet consumer needs and then we become part of the solutions for what consumers are looking for. Cooking at home does remain elevated right now and our price points are really a small percentage of the cost of a meal when you think about the most enjoyable part of the meal, which is flavor. And so, as we see consumers increasingly shop the perimeter, continue to cook at home, our categories really play an even more important role, including condiments and sauces and we're seeing a benefit from that. I mean, one thought is just to show you how consumers are responding in this current environment. In the second quarter, spices and seasonings were the top category in the center of store growth across measured channels. So, that tells you something that this is a tool for consumers to really deliver on what they're looking for. And of course, we're the leading branded player, but we're also driving category unit growth within that context, too. When consumers are pressured, I think in this environment, regardless of maybe their level of income and they're cooking at home, they will lean in on flavor, they might even splurge on it. One example that we would share or at least a couple is when we look at what's driving younger consumers right now, interestingly, they're going to our gourmet line and buying more of our gourmet line. As they cook more at home, they do want to -- we know they want to explore and really kind of explore flavor overall. And that gourmet line, I think really kind of suits what they're looking for. If you think about the low- to mid-income consumer, they're looking for brands with price points closer to private label. That's why we're -- from an innovation standpoint, we're adding new seasoning blends to our Lawry's line, and that attracts these consumers and we're seeing the consumer trade up in that particular case, because they're looking for brands that they trust. We do see right now overall consumer shopping smaller sizes than maybe we did this time last year, where we saw a lot of large size purchasing going on. So that means we have to assure that we have the right price pack architecture in place to meet that demand. Another example that just to give you even more color, if you will, is in recipe mixes. With a lot of our programs, including sort of revenue management and price gap management, we're attracting a lot more consumers overall to that category. Recipe mix is a great value, especially when you just want to buy for a specific meal. It's a great convenience. There's no waste. It's a great way to explore new flavors at low risk, so you don't have to invest in, let's say, a whole bottle. But what's happened is we've seen household penetration grow for our brands during the second quarter in a category like that. So, I think that also gives some context. And then, I'll just wrap it up with one other idea. We are seeing a lot of growth in this mini trial size area and we view that as a pretty interesting tool for lowering the cost for consumers to try new flavors. And so, we're also launching those here in the second quarter and just shipping those now, but that's just another opportunity for consumers to explore, look at innovation, but it's at a lower price point for them to kind of give it a try in these mini trial sizes. So, I kind of wanted to give you sort of a collection of context or points to consider when we think about meeting the consumers' needs today.\nSteve Powers: Yes. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. And if I could maybe pivot, Mike, a question on gross margin. I apologize if you already provided some commentary here, but indulge me anyway. Through the first half of the year, you're trending towards the upper end of that gross margin expansion range. And I guess just as I extrapolate to the back half, is it fair to assume that you're comfortable with the upper half of the range at least for the full year? Or is -- are we open to more volatility in the back half, where that the full range is kind of in play?\nMike Smith: Well, I think in the back half, the guide implies almost like 5 basis points to 100 basis points and we say for the year 50 basis points to 100 basis points. So, we realized we had a really strong first half. As I said, pricing was large in the first quarter for us, that's going away into the second half. And the key is the volume growth. I mean, volume growth -- volume is great for a lot of things and it helps gross margin and mix and all that sort of stuff. So, I think we're comfortable with the guide we have. I wouldn't say right now I'd guide to the higher end at this point, but to give you all the reasons I said.\nSteve Powers: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nMike Smith: Remember, some of the cost savings program we have like GOE was really first quarter into the second quarter. So, some of those are going away also. But it's still -- the trends we see in gross margin, the first -- the second half is higher than the first half traditionally, which is going to continue again, and we do see a nice trajectory there for gross margin over time as we continue our multiyear journey of getting back to kind of the pre-COVID gross margin levels.\nSteve Powers: Understood. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Let me add my congratulations to Mike and to Marcos. So, looking forward to working with you. Maybe if I could continue on some of the pricing discussion that we just had, and I guess what I'm just trying to segregate, if I look at the spices and seasonings category in the more recent months in the scanner data, it does seem like the whole -- your entire portfolio has unit pricing lower on a year-on-year basis. And I guess maybe is there a size -- it doesn't seem like there's an impact of size and unit and price pack architecture necessarily. Promo percentage is also a little bit lower year-over-year. But I guess I'm trying to just square the notion of more surgical pricing actions on a small part of the portfolio with the spices and seasonings category in total for you that is showing kind of negative pricing in the last few months of Nielsen data.\nMike Smith: Yeah.\nBrendan Foley: Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Smith: Yeah, I'll start. I mean, at the end of the day, the net sales guidance we gave for pricing and the results of what we showed, again, you have for the Consumer business for the second quarter was down a little under 1%, which we continue to see that in the second half. So that would suggest that the pricing actions we said we were going to do, the surgical pricing actions on a limited part of the portfolio, that's what shown up through net sales. Now what happens when that gets to shelf, that's a whole another story. And in addition to the things that we're doing on some of those items, there's other retailer actions that are happening too. Because as Brendan said before, this is a category -- our categories are growing. That's where people want to shop in more of the perimeter of the store. They're wanting to use products like ours to flavor these -- and manage cost inflation across protein and things like that. So, the retailers also are contributing to some of these things. We might not -- it might not be our price adjustments on items, that maybe other ones that they're seeing and operating in their stores too. So, I think there's a combination of factors that maybe skewing a little bit of the data you're seeing versus our internal kind of what we're actually reporting on these calls.\nBrendan Foley: Just to add to that, Adam, when you look just like spices and seasonings and recipe mixes depending on how you're looking at data, the percentage is still small in terms of the percentage of that part of our portfolio that it's kind of receiving that sort of an effort. But let's also not forget, we have a broad program from in terms of increased brand investment, new items, increased distribution, et cetera. And so, we're driving volume growth, particularly even in -- I would say, certainly it's an accelerated area as a part of our portfolio that's driving unit volume growth. And so, we're seeing really good performance -- net performance from that.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That's helpful color. If I just ask a clarifying question just on guidance? On the JV on Mexico, if I look at the guidance, it would seem like you've already achieved for the full year the equivalent of mid-teens profit growth on income from the Mexican JV. And I just -- make sure I'm understanding, is there expectations of profit declines in the back half or -- because otherwise you're going to be well above mid-teens profit growth on that line...\nMike Smith: Remember, going back to last year, we're lapping a really strong second half. A lot of the acceleration they've seen and great performance is really second-half focused last year. So, we're lapping a tough comp, I'd say.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. All right. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Mike and Marcos, congratulations to you both. I wanted to clarify just on the expected volume recovery in the back half of the year in Flavor Solutions. Are you assuming that industry trends get better or this is really McCormick-specific initiatives or maybe it's a combo? I just want to clarify that.\nBrendan Foley: Yeah, I don't know that -- Tom, as we look at it, we don't say we're making a call or projection on the industry as total. We kind of look at our customer base, and we understand their plans and programs, what might be innovation that's going to be launching soon, how they might be thinking about driving maybe an uptick in their own activity. And so that's really what drives I think our thinking is more specifically at a customer level as opposed to hearing us make a call and a projection on an industry. I don't know if you want to go deeper on that, but I think just to quickly kind of let you know how we think about it, that's what drives our thinking.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thanks for that. No, I was just trying to reconcile some of the foodservice weakness with the positive tone. And so that was helpful. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, I think let me just add to that, Tom. I mean, in Branded Foodservice though, I mean, just to give you some context around that, we are seeing nice performance there. I think that's a reflection of -- we operate in every segment of foodservice. So, it isn't just QSRs, it's fast casual, casual dining, independent restaurants, college and university, et cetera, et cetera. So, it's a very diverse sort of marketplace. As we look at that, we're doing really well in Branded Foodservice, because we're driving some really, I think interesting programming like with limited time offers with our brands like Frank's or we're growing share in a number of categories or performing well in spices and seasonings. We're getting more hot sauce on tabletops. That's what kind of drives, I think, our performance right now in Branded Foodservice, which operates a little bit differently than maybe the QSR part of the foodservice marketplace. So maybe that additional color might provide some additional things to think about.\nTom Palmer: No, that was very helpful. Thank you. Just on the expected margin improvements in Flavor Solutions, should we be thinking about continued sequential improvement in margin as the year plays out and some of these cost initiatives take hold?\nMike Smith: We've said it at the beginning of the year, I'll go back to that, I mean, one, we're really happy with the margin improvement we've experienced last year and we gave guidance for this fiscal year for the total company of about 80 basis points of OP margin improvement. And we said at the time, Flavor Solutions might be slightly ahead of that, but in the range of [0.8] (ph). Through the first half, Flavor Solutions was at I think at 80 basis points, so roughly around there. So again, we're always looking for improvement. I'd say that for the whole company, we're really comfortable with 50 basis points to 100 basis points. A lot of -- and as I said about a month ago, a lot depends on the volume numbers and the Consumer business continues to see volume growth that drives margin improvement. In Flavor Solutions, a bit of dip in the second quarter could put a little bit of pressure on margins, as I said, but we're expecting sequential improvement in Flavor Solutions. That's not going to be materially different than what we said at the beginning of the year, I'd say.\nTom Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. I think I always get the final question with McCormick. Just, I guess, kind of a broader question around frozen, Asian that you commented, it seems like consumers are shopping at the perimeter of the store a little bit, understand kind of the desire to kind of cook at home still. Maybe there's some value seeking in there. But I'm just curious like if you step back and you think about that consumer behavior on the perimeter and on the spice and seasoning side relative to kind of what you've seen in frozen and Asian, maybe you could just provide a little bit more color as to how you're thinking about kind of that relative performance of those two areas and maybe why parts are frozen and Asian specifically aren't performing as well as maybe they have in past economic cycle? Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Well, thanks for the question, Rob. If I go back and I think about that part of our portfolio, one of the important things maybe to reinforce, it's a smaller part of our business. But the declines, I think, as far back as like the fourth quarter of '23 were steeper. So, they're pulling down, I think, the overall view of the portfolio. And that's why we decided to make sure it was kind of called out, because as we are putting more focus in investment around what we would call those core categories, that was going to -- we felt that would offset that. As we move through the rest of the year, I think that we start to see those core categories start to overcome whatever declines might be experiencing there. To the consumer behavior context that you're asking about, we think that has a lot to do with, it could be the impact of inflation in the marketplace. I think that certainly can have an impact on that overall. And we're a relatively small player in a number of these areas. So, it's not as if we're operating with the type of scale and competitive leverage that others might be. So yes, we certainly see inflation hurting that. But also I think some consumer trends might have been shifting away a little bit from some parts of whether it'd be frozen or some Asian categories that we compete in. And so therefore, I don't know that they're necessarily suggesting a structural impact of change, but rather this is just a trend that we're working through. And it was we felt like we are going to experience it most of this fiscal year. So, I would share that as our context. What we're seeing in the primitive store is simply, you need to add flavor in a lot of these situations, whether it be protein or produce or carbs. Our category is going to play an important role in flavoring, or both of our categories rather. And so, we see consumer shifting there probably because they're looking for healthy eating. That's not a new trend and that's something that we think continues to fuel our business. So, I think it's probably where I'd keep it for right now today, Rob. And if there's any other clarification you want, let me know.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah. No, that was very helpful. Thank you. And then, Mike, first, congratulations, [indiscernible]. I think there was a comment you made, Mike, in the prepared remarks where you said that there might be similar segment trends expected as you get to the back half relative to Q2. And I may have missed that, but I just wanted to clarify because clearly everything else we've been talking about in Q&A suggests that things should get better. So, just want to understand what you're...\nMike Smith: Yeah, that was in the prepared remarks. We talked -- that was really in the reference in that section we're talking about pricing for the remainder of the year and similar segment trends -- similar company and segment trends for the remainder of the year. So, if you look at the pricing trends in Q2 versus prior year, approximately the same by segment and for total company.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Got it. That's all.\nMike Smith: That really helps your model question.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah. No, right. I get it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining today's call. If you have any further questions on the information we shared today, please feel to contact me. And this concludes this morning's conference call. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter performance, particularly as we continue to navigate a changing and complex consumer landscape. Our differentiated results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments to accelerate volume trends and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. McCormick remains a growth company, and 2024 continues to be an important investment year. As planned, as we have activated many of our initiatives and we are starting to see results that support our confidence in delivering on our long-term objectives. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our second quarter results focusing on the top-line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some areas of success as well as areas we continue to work on, and review our growth plans with a focus on innovation. Mike will then go into more depth on the second quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the second quarter, sales declined by 1% in constant currency, reflecting flat pricing, and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Volume growth in our Consumer segment was offset by declines in Flavor Solutions related to softness in some of our quick serve restaurant, or QSR, and packaged food customers volumes as well as the timing of customer activities, as expected. Although certain parts of our Flavor Solutions business are pressured, given our collaboration and strong innovation pipeline with our customers, we expect volume trends to improve during the second half of the year. In our Consumer segment, volumes improved substantially from the first quarter across our major markets and delivered volume growth. In the Americas, we delivered solid sequential volume improvement for three consecutive quarters, and our pricing in the second quarter reflects the activation of our price gap management plans to support improved volumes in the second half, as planned. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories for the second consecutive quarter. We expanded distribution in the grocery, discounter and e-commerce channels, and realized benefits from new product innovation. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we delivered strong volume-led sales growth, as we executed the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for our core spices and seasonings portfolio and realized distribution gains. This performance was tempered by China as expected, although sequentially volume trends improved in China. Results in our Consumer business reflect continued focus on increased brand marketing investments, accelerating innovation in alignment with consumer trends, and expanding distribution. Let me now share our current view on the state of the consumer. Consumers continue to exhibit value seeking behavior. Financial anxiety remains elevated, particularly in the United States, and especially with mid- to low-income households due to the compounding impact of inflation. In addition, inflation in the foodservice channel is leading to softness in food away-from-home consumption and impacting restaurant traffic, particularly with QSRs across many of our regions. Volumes on the retail side, particularly in the center of store, remained soft. Consumers continue to buy just for what they need and make more frequent trips to the store. On the other hand, they are increasingly shopping the perimeter and continuing to cook at home. Certain categories such as spices and seasonings as well as condiments and sauces are seeing a benefit amid these trends. As consumers are looking to stretch their budgets, our categories represent a fraction of the cost relative to proteins, produce, and carbs and drive the majority of the flavor. In fact, in the second quarter, spices and seasonings was the top category in center store growth across measured channels. And McCormick is the leading branded player and driving category unit growth. What continues to differentiate McCormick is that we operate in great categories across all channels. We offer products at every price point, from premium to lower price points. We have a broad and diversified portfolio to meet evolving consumer demands. We are part of the solution for consumers. Importantly, we believe that we have the right plans in place that are continually informed by what matters most to our consumers and customers. Moving to Slide 5, let me highlight for the quarter some of the key areas of our success. For our global Consumer segment, including the Americas, our core categories delivered solid volume growth. In spices and seasonings, we delivered volume growth across all of our major markets. In the US, our share performance improved, resulting in positive gains in unit share for the quarter. In addition, we drove dollar share gains in France and Eastern Europe. In recipe mixes, we continued to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas, particularly in our Mexican product lines, through our price gap management investments as well as distribution growth. In addition, in EMEA, recipe mixes were a significant driver of UK volume growth and we realized dollar market share gains for two consecutive quarters. In mustard, we are driving improved unit consumption and unit market share trends across our regions. In the Americas we expanded distribution and actioned our pricing investments. In addition, innovation is yielding results. Our creamy dill fickle mustard performance is exceeding our expectations. In Poland, mustard consumption continues to grow and we are realizing dollar market share gains, which strengthened from the first quarter. In Flavor Solutions, we had pockets of strength this quarter. In our Americas Branded Foodservice business, despite softness in the overall market, we grew volumes. In our Americas Flavors business, our performance with high-growth innovator customers remained strong. We grew in non-alcoholic beverages and saw continued strength in performance nutrition. In Asia Pacific, including China, we drove strong volume growth as we benefited from new customer products and promotions. Let me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian and Americas consumer. Importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the volume growth in our core categories is beginning to fully offset these declines. In hot sauce, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty, and we continue to invest in our market-leading brands. In the Americas, consumption and share trends improved in the second quarter on top of our first quarter improvement. A couple of short-term items continue to impact our share. First, [as appears] (ph) that is lapping their own supply chain disruptions, and second, new price pack architecture in the form of trial sizes, which have been incremental to the category. As we realize the benefit of our increased innovation, including Frank's new Dip'n sauces and Squeeze bottles, as well as mini trial sizes, A&P investments and distribution expansion, we expect to drive improved hot sauce consumption trends in the second half of 2024. In Flavor Solutions, our volumes were impacted by slower QSR traffic in both EMEA and the Americas. We expect to improve these volume trends as we continue to execute on our growth plans in the second half of the year. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers experienced additional softness in volumes within their own business in both the Americas and EMEA. We are collaborating with our customers to support their innovation plans and we are continuing to diversify our customer base over time. Before moving to our growth plans, I'd like to note that our total US Branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by Circana data and combined with unmeasured channels, outpaced our sales growth this quarter, as our brand investments drove improved consumption and we are lapping the increased shipments that came in ahead of the 2023 pricing actions of the prior year. This is a function of timing from quarter-to-quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on Slide 6, which are supporting our second quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and into 2025. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories, and we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. And I look forward to sharing more details on these plans at our upcoming Investor Day in October. Brand marketing, new products and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies and customer engagement continue to be the levers that drive our growth. For today, I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight one of these levers, innovation, on Slide 7 and 8. First, it's important to recognize that we are one of the few, if not the only company that operates in end to end flavor with both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach. Our shared insights give us a strong understanding of consumers' flavor needs, preferences and trends. And we have the ability to translate this into innovation, making McCormick a global leader in flavor trends and flavor innovation. Innovation is a priority for us. It drives one-third of our long-term algorithm. It meaningfully contributed to our results for the first half of 2024, and we expect it to drive strong performance in the second half. As a management team, we discussed the latest trends and insights and how those might translate into innovation in both segments. We are continuously leading the pursuit of what's next in flavor. In our company, everyone is engaged in innovation. In the first half of the year, our results benefited from new products and packaging and the performance of these launches continues to improve. Importantly, our pipeline for the remainder of the year remains robust. In our Consumer segment, our renovated US everyday urban spice portfolio is fully shipped, and roughly two-thirds of our new packaging is currently on shelf, driving double-digit velocity gains and contributing to our strong volume improvement in spices and seasonings. New products within our spices and seasonings portfolio, including Lawry's new seasoning blends, Flavor Maker blend, and our exciting grilling portfolio of Stubb's rubs and new Grill Mates seasonings blends in partnership with Max the Meat Guy fuel first-half results and are expected to accelerate our performance in the second-half. In fact, in 2024, we are launching nearly 4 times more grilling rubs and seasonings compared to 2023. Importantly, our grilling season, which kicked-off at the end of second quarter is off to a great start. In addition to our grilling blends and rubs, we are excited about early results from Frank's RedHot Dip'n sauce and popular flavors in the Squeeze bottle format that we launched this year. We are energized for the grilling season and expect our [Flame & Flavor] (ph) marketing campaign that launched in the second quarter to drive incremental consumer demand. Our Cholula salsas and recipe mixes that launched in 2023 are driving new buyers to the category and continue to exceed our expectations since launch. Cholula salsas are driving strong incremental category growth with our high repeat buy rates and our Cholula recipe mixes are a top recipe mix brand after just one year in the market. They are driving the second highest unit growth within the category. We continue to build US distribution and we are launching both formats in Canada this year. In EMEA, growth from new product sales is accelerating and we expect it to drive significant growth in the second half of the year. In the UK, across recipe mixes and seasonings, our Schwartz range with Nadiya Hussain, restaurant-branded partnerships and a range of classic American recipe mixes with Frank's, OLD BAY and French's are driving our innovation performance and expanding household penetration with younger consumers. In France, we are collaborating with Juan Arbelaez, a celebrity Colombian French chef, to drive engagement with younger households. And recently we partnered with him to launch a range of unique and delicious Ducros barbecue seasonings in time for the summer barbecue season. Moving now to our Flavor Solutions segment, we continue to leverage our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors, to win new customers, diversify our customer base and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our high-growth innovator and consumer products' customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. As we look to our innovation pipeline that we support for our customers, we expect to pick up in the back half of the year. We are collaborating with many customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages to performance nutrition. Our win rate with heat briefs are strong across our regions and we continue to dedicate resources to where we have the right to win. In Branded Foodservice, our 2023 launches, including Frank's Mild Wings Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot, are delivering strong results in the first half of the year. Our early 2024 launches are also contributing to our growth and include a number of e-products like Grill Mates Fiery Habanero and Cholula Chili Lime. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect new products to meaningfully drive our top-line, and importantly, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching Frank's Garlic Buffalo and Mango Habanero in the Americas, as well as Frank's RedHot Mayo in the UK and France, and we are further extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our Consumer segment into the foodservice channel. Overall, we are very excited about our innovation plans for 2024. We expect new product performance to be in-line with our long-term objectives and to drive a meaningful portion of our volume growth. In addition, in the second half of the year, sales from new products are expected to nearly double compared to the first half, and a meaningful portion of this innovation is in heat. Heat-infused products span our portfolio. Across both segments, we expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for total McCormick. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands, deep consumer insights and our meaningful scale, technology and expertise that we have been building for decades. As we look ahead, we are maintaining our outlook for 2024. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we continue to expect our top-line to be at the mid- to high-end of our guidance range given the momentum we saw in the first half of the year, particularly in our Consumer segment. We are confident in our initiatives and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also remain prudent and continue to reflect the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024. To wrap up, let me reiterate three key points. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continues to be very strong, and importantly, consumer interest in cooking remains strong. We remain dedicated to accelerating our volume trends. We refine and adapt our plans as needed and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to sustainable volume-led growth, and you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now, before Mike's remarks, I'd like to speak to the management transition. As you likely know, last night we announced Mike's decision to retire at the end of February. Mike has been an exceptional leader at McCormick for more than three decades. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving top-tier organic growth as well as our successful acquisition agenda. His deep knowledge of McCormick and effective execution of our CCI initiatives helped fuel our growth investments to deliver profitable growth. Mike is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork. He helped build a world-class global finance team. He will be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Mike, congratulations on your successful career and your upcoming retirement. In the same announcement, Marcos Gabriel was named Executive Vice President and CFO effective December 1. Marcos will serve on our management committee and lead the company's finance organization and global business services team. Marcos is a proven global leader with over 25 years of experience in the consumer products industry. His expertise across major multinational companies in several geographies will be instrumental as we continue to execute our growth plans. I have worked with Marcos over the last seven years. He has served in key senior leadership roles at McCormick, contributing meaningfully to our profitable growth and improved productivity. Marcos, congratulation on this promotion and I look forward to working with you in this new role. Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on Slide 26. First-half results and volume performance in the Consumer segment demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantaged categories across segments. We're able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our cost saving programs to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the first half coupled with our growth plans give us confidence in achieving the mid- to high-end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their dedication and their contributions, and reiterate my confidence that together we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now, for your questions. Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Just to maybe open up with a couple of points to reinforce, we did have a good quarter and sales do continue to strengthen, which gives us confidence in that mid- to upper-end of our range. But this also includes that short-term weakness that we felt with Flavor Solutions in the quarter. I think one of the important things I want to make sure we get across is that we did drive volume growth in our global Consumer segment. And it does reflect kind of in many ways, I think that additional program that we talked about. We're also driving strong sequential volume improvement in Americas like you just called out in the Consumer business, and specifically in spices and seasonings, we delivered volume growth across all major markets and then included driving unit share growth in the US. So, we said this was a year of investment and we further executed those programs that we've been talking about. And at the same time, we still expanded margins. So, we're pretty pleased with the results at this point. It is a halfway point in the year and we do like the progress that we're making. If I were to add more context and unpacking those levers that we've been talking about on this call and in previous calls, a lot of it is, we did ramp up brand marketing in the first half and it wasn't just in the first quarter. We also saw a significant ramp up in the second quarter, too. And a lot of that investment was going more against our core categories to drive demand and support our initiatives. And we continue to expect healthy levels as we go into the second half of the year on brand marketing. New products was also a big part of that, too, in the first half and it contributed pretty meaningfully, especially a lot of that build happened in the second quarter. I would say, it was more pronounced in the second quarter than even in the first, just because of the build of getting items on shelf and beginning to ship them. And we expect to double that innovation when you compare the second half to the first half. So, that lines up nicely as we go into the balance of the year. And then, we expanded distribution in certain categories. Our new products are gaining strong retail acceptance. And so, that's obviously one of those levers that helps. And in terms of pricing in the second quarter, we activated many of our price gap management programs. And so, we expect this to continue into the second half, because we know the [uplift] (ph) with the performance that we're seeing from that, but it's still only a portion of our strategy. As we said before, it impacts about 15% of our Americas Consumer business, but it is yielding the results that we were expecting to get. And so, all of these growth levers are contributing and driving, I think, really healthy outcomes as we think about the performance of our business. So, by the way, we operate in great categories, too. So, the categories are performing well also. And so that obviously is a nice tailwind as part of that. Good morning. Yes, I think what drives our confidence is as we look at our business, at the brand and sort of the key category and unit level, we think the programs are having strong impact, coupled with where we think consumers are moving within the store and what they're doing. As people tend to when they feel like -- if you think about the inflation, food-away-from-home, we're definitely seeing people shift more to eating at home, and that certainly benefits our business as we've always mentioned. But as people shop the perimeter, I think they're looking for opportunities in terms of how they flavor their meals, and so that really does benefit our categories. When I think about broadly though, Peter, just the overall consumer outlook, it hasn't really changed a lot since our last guidance or even on our last call. I mean, we're pretty confident in our initiatives and we think they're working. But our outlook assumes the consumer is kind of where they are, or they have been like in the fourth quarter of '23 and the first half of '24. And so, we continue to take a cautious view on our outlook. I think that just reflects what might be uncertainty or inconsistency that we tend to see in the environment. But we believe even in that environment, we plan for our plants to kind of deliver this type of performance. So, we see the consumer moving around and shifting channels, that's definitely happening, and I think that pops up in the numbers, but it tends to benefit our business, whether it's in foodservice or whether it's at meals-at-home. We're flavoring all those occasions. So, we really believe that when we're -- as an end-to-end provider of flavor, we tend to benefit depending on wherever channel it shifts into. Yeah. I'll lead off with a couple of comments, Mike. I mean, I do think, Ken, we felt like we did have strong consumer performance and our investments are working and doing what we said we would do. And so that does give us confidence going into the second half and perhaps that's why you're hearing a little bit of confidence in our tone. But given how the first half performed, we expect those growth levers in the consumer part of our business to continue to operate and work well. As we said on Flavor Solutions, we expect sequential improvement versus what we saw in the second quarter, because there's many other things that I think as Mike said earlier in the questions here, it does give us confidence as we think about what how we might look at the Flavor Solutions business. But Mike, if you want to talk a little bit about what drives our prudence probably has to do with the back half is a big part of the year... Alexia, thanks for the question. Good morning. I think as you think about the core of your question is that long-term outlook as you think about our customer space and portfolio of Flavor Solutions, I would go back to things that we've said in prior discussions. If we think about the Flavor Solutions business is constantly in activity of continuing to shape that portfolio to higher value-added products and technologies and customer base. So, as we continue to shape that portfolio, it continues to go in the direction of sort of our flavors business, which includes seasonings as we think about our portfolio. And in many ways, some of the fastest-growing areas of that portfolio happened to be the small, highly-innovative, emerging customers that are operating in categories that like performance nutrition or non-alcoholic beverages, where like this quarter, we continue to see real strength. That is a form of looking at how we diversify our customer base, but we're also operating where we think there are strong areas of growth. And these this really I think is kind of the central point that we've talked about is, we'll continue to shape that part of our -- the Flavor Solutions segment and that portfolio to that higher value-added sort of product and technology sale that we have. And this is, I think, what you see quarter-to-quarter is a reflection of that. Thank you, Steve. I think in the two questions you asked there, let me address your first one first. Yeah, you can make the assumption that as we think about the rest of the year in that price gap management activity, what we've implemented year-to-date largely reflects how we're thinking about carrying through the rest of the year. Having said that, we're looking at performance all the time. And so, we might make tweaks. We might look at the performance of programs and decide whether or not we want to make adjustments. But as we look at it today, we feel like we're positioned for given the performance so far that these programs are operating the way we want them to and should continue into the second half, I think with a strong level of confidence. So, I think just to kind of hit that first area first and how you should think about that program activity. As it relates to the consumer and how they're operating and what might be the way to think about consumer behavior today in the store, I would just maybe add a couple of thoughts there. We have the broadest portfolio in the category, particularly like in spices and seasonings and that really does differentiate us. But what that allows us to do is, we're operating across all channels. We have products at every price point, whether it be premium or lower price points and we even explored like we did with the Lawry's opening price point, launching that item in there was to really take care of another price point area that we felt like we need to operate in. But this broader diversified portfolio allows us to meet consumer needs and then we become part of the solutions for what consumers are looking for. Cooking at home does remain elevated right now and our price points are really a small percentage of the cost of a meal when you think about the most enjoyable part of the meal, which is flavor. And so, as we see consumers increasingly shop the perimeter, continue to cook at home, our categories really play an even more important role, including condiments and sauces and we're seeing a benefit from that. I mean, one thought is just to show you how consumers are responding in this current environment. In the second quarter, spices and seasonings were the top category in the center of store growth across measured channels. So, that tells you something that this is a tool for consumers to really deliver on what they're looking for. And of course, we're the leading branded player, but we're also driving category unit growth within that context, too. When consumers are pressured, I think in this environment, regardless of maybe their level of income and they're cooking at home, they will lean in on flavor, they might even splurge on it. One example that we would share or at least a couple is when we look at what's driving younger consumers right now, interestingly, they're going to our gourmet line and buying more of our gourmet line. As they cook more at home, they do want to -- we know they want to explore and really kind of explore flavor overall. And that gourmet line, I think really kind of suits what they're looking for. If you think about the low- to mid-income consumer, they're looking for brands with price points closer to private label. That's why we're -- from an innovation standpoint, we're adding new seasoning blends to our Lawry's line, and that attracts these consumers and we're seeing the consumer trade up in that particular case, because they're looking for brands that they trust. We do see right now overall consumer shopping smaller sizes than maybe we did this time last year, where we saw a lot of large size purchasing going on. So that means we have to assure that we have the right price pack architecture in place to meet that demand. Another example that just to give you even more color, if you will, is in recipe mixes. With a lot of our programs, including sort of revenue management and price gap management, we're attracting a lot more consumers overall to that category. Recipe mix is a great value, especially when you just want to buy for a specific meal. It's a great convenience. There's no waste. It's a great way to explore new flavors at low risk, so you don't have to invest in, let's say, a whole bottle. But what's happened is we've seen household penetration grow for our brands during the second quarter in a category like that. So, I think that also gives some context. And then, I'll just wrap it up with one other idea. We are seeing a lot of growth in this mini trial size area and we view that as a pretty interesting tool for lowering the cost for consumers to try new flavors. And so, we're also launching those here in the second quarter and just shipping those now, but that's just another opportunity for consumers to explore, look at innovation, but it's at a lower price point for them to kind of give it a try in these mini trial sizes. So, I kind of wanted to give you sort of a collection of context or points to consider when we think about meeting the consumers' needs today. Good morning. Go ahead, Mike. Just to add to that, Adam, when you look just like spices and seasonings and recipe mixes depending on how you're looking at data, the percentage is still small in terms of the percentage of that part of our portfolio that it's kind of receiving that sort of an effort. But let's also not forget, we have a broad program from in terms of increased brand investment, new items, increased distribution, et cetera. And so, we're driving volume growth, particularly even in -- I would say, certainly it's an accelerated area as a part of our portfolio that's driving unit volume growth. And so, we're seeing really good performance -- net performance from that. Yeah, I don't know that -- Tom, as we look at it, we don't say we're making a call or projection on the industry as total. We kind of look at our customer base, and we understand their plans and programs, what might be innovation that's going to be launching soon, how they might be thinking about driving maybe an uptick in their own activity. And so that's really what drives I think our thinking is more specifically at a customer level as opposed to hearing us make a call and a projection on an industry. I don't know if you want to go deeper on that, but I think just to quickly kind of let you know how we think about it, that's what drives our thinking. Well, I think let me just add to that, Tom. I mean, in Branded Foodservice though, I mean, just to give you some context around that, we are seeing nice performance there. I think that's a reflection of -- we operate in every segment of foodservice. So, it isn't just QSRs, it's fast casual, casual dining, independent restaurants, college and university, et cetera, et cetera. So, it's a very diverse sort of marketplace. As we look at that, we're doing really well in Branded Foodservice, because we're driving some really, I think interesting programming like with limited time offers with our brands like Frank's or we're growing share in a number of categories or performing well in spices and seasonings. We're getting more hot sauce on tabletops. That's what kind of drives, I think, our performance right now in Branded Foodservice, which operates a little bit differently than maybe the QSR part of the foodservice marketplace. So maybe that additional color might provide some additional things to think about. Well, thanks for the question, Rob. If I go back and I think about that part of our portfolio, one of the important things maybe to reinforce, it's a smaller part of our business. But the declines, I think, as far back as like the fourth quarter of '23 were steeper. So, they're pulling down, I think, the overall view of the portfolio. And that's why we decided to make sure it was kind of called out, because as we are putting more focus in investment around what we would call those core categories, that was going to -- we felt that would offset that. As we move through the rest of the year, I think that we start to see those core categories start to overcome whatever declines might be experiencing there. To the consumer behavior context that you're asking about, we think that has a lot to do with, it could be the impact of inflation in the marketplace. I think that certainly can have an impact on that overall. And we're a relatively small player in a number of these areas. So, it's not as if we're operating with the type of scale and competitive leverage that others might be. So yes, we certainly see inflation hurting that. But also I think some consumer trends might have been shifting away a little bit from some parts of whether it'd be frozen or some Asian categories that we compete in. And so therefore, I don't know that they're necessarily suggesting a structural impact of change, but rather this is just a trend that we're working through. And it was we felt like we are going to experience it most of this fiscal year. So, I would share that as our context. What we're seeing in the primitive store is simply, you need to add flavor in a lot of these situations, whether it be protein or produce or carbs. Our category is going to play an important role in flavoring, or both of our categories rather. And so, we see consumer shifting there probably because they're looking for healthy eating. That's not a new trend and that's something that we think continues to fuel our business. So, I think it's probably where I'd keep it for right now today, Rob. And if there's any other clarification you want, let me know."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks very much for those remarks, Marcos and Brendan. Joining McCormick more than 30 years ago was one of the best decisions I've ever made. This is a great company and it continues to get better. I am proud of the progress we have made over the years. We significantly grew our top-line, generated fuel for growth through improved productivity and continued to deliver solid results despite the complexity and uncertainty we experienced the last few years. I am so proud of and grateful for our entire team here at McCormick and appreciate all of their contributions and efforts. My decision to retire in February is based in part on Marcos' readiness to move into the role. I've had the privilege of working with him for several years and witnessed his strong financial leadership and ability to drive results. I'm confident that Marcos, in partnership with Brendan and the rest of our leadership team, have the capabilities and vision to continue to advance our leadership and differentiation and capture all the great opportunities that are ahead for McCormick. Lastly, I look forward to partnering with Brendan and Marcos to ensure a smooth transition over the next few months. Now moving to our results for the second quarter. Starting on Slide 11, our top-line constant currency sales declined 1% compared to the second quarter of last year, including the impact of the canning divestiture and reflects flat pricing, offset by a 1% volume and product mix decline. As expected, volume declines were primarily driven by lower customer demand and the timing of customer activities in the Flavor Solutions segment. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 1%, driven by pricing investments. Volumes were slightly positive and reflect a substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter. On Slide 12, Consumer sales in the Americas declined to 2% versus the second quarter of last year. This decline reflects pricing investments of 1% and flat volumes. Volume growth in spices and seasonings was offset by volume declines in prepared food categories, including frozen and Asian. In terms of pricing, we continue to take a surgical and data-driven approach to managing price gaps, and our investments are still expected to impact about 15% of our Americas Consumer segment. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales increased 4%, driven entirely by volume. Sales growth was broad based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through in 2024. Constant currency Consumer sales in the APAC region were down 1%, driven by a 2% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we delivered volume-led growth in the mid-teens that was broad based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 15, second quarter constant currency sales declined 1%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decline in volume and the impact of the divestiture of the canning business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales declined 1%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decrease in volume, driven by the timing of customer activities as well as the softness in quick service restaurant and packaged food customer volumes. This was partially offset by volume growth in our Branded Foodservice business, as Brendan mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 8%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business, lower volume and product mix of 4%, reflecting the impact of QSR and packaged food customers' volumes and the timing of some customer activities. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 10% in constant currency. Volume grew 9%, driven by customers promotions, limited time offers and new products, while pricing contributed 1%. As seen on Slide 19, gross profit margin expanded by 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, driven primarily by the benefit of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, or CCI. As we look ahead, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year. Now, moving to Slide 20. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased versus the second quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing investments, which were partially offset by CCI cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points. As expected, brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results and we can anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts. Adjusted operating income was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 with minimal impact from currency as gross margin expansion was offset by higher SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 3% or 2% in constant currency. While in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 6% with minimal impact from currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the second quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus prior year in this segment. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top-line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 21. Our interest expense was up slightly versus the prior year. The reduction in average debt was more than offset by higher short-term interest rates. And touching on tax, our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 22.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant benefit this year. Our second quarter adjusted rate benefited from a discrete tax item, primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an international legal entity reorganization. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the second quarter reflect strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We remain the market leader with our McCormick brand of mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 23, second quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.60 for the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the discrete tax benefit and higher income from unconsolidated operations I just mentioned. On Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2024, our cash flow from operations was $302 million compared to $394 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation payments and the timing of cash tax payments. We returned $226 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $130 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now, turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 25. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top-line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Given the momentum in our first half, we expect to be at the mid- to high-end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we expect the favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, realized primarily in the first quarter to be partially offset by our price gap management investments that will drive volume growth. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect total pricing to be flat relative to the prior year and segment trends are expected to be similar to the second quarter. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize and we continue to expect to return to total volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic headwinds. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio. The impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. In China, our food-away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, was impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect China Consumer sales to be flat to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in that long-term growth trajectory of the China business. Finally, the divestiture of the Giotti canning business will impact us through the third quarter. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low-single digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the UK in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high-single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing be concentrated in the first half of the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in discrete items. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We are moving in the right direction and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2024 financial outlook and long-term objectives over time. Thank you, Andrew. We'll see you at Investor Day. Yes, that's no problem. I mean, we did say on the call, we are expecting some sequential improvement in the Q3 and Q4. There was -- we had talked about that a month ago, low-single digit to mid-single digit. So, we did come in at the low-single digit phase, which we're happy with. We're always happy with those results. As you get down into some of the customer activity timing, which we have more clarity to, some of the partnership that we're working with and getting more information on activities of customers, now some of those are second-half related, some will carry into 2025. So, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we feel good about where that sequential improvement we're seeing in addition to the great consumer performance that Brendan just alluded to. Yeah, absolutely. There's a number of factors that kind of impact the difference between our shipments and consumption. And just to give you some context around that, and maybe I'll just share with you three points to kind of consider. First of all, our consumption is strengthening. And if I were to think about how that progressed through the second quarter, I think more of it we saw in the back half of the second quarter than in the front half. So, that would reflect as we started to really get execution of our programs, in retail, we were seeing stronger consumption. So, it started to pull up. In Q2 across the total portfolio, we drove almost a full point of unit growth. And so that gave us reason to feel confident and that includes those declines in prepared foods that we talked about like the frozen and Asian category declines. But it was a substantial improvement from Q1 and driven by that increased programming. I think that is, to some degree, a condition of sales catching up to our performance on shelf. So, as retailers start to see, I think, our movement, we obviously expect sales to keep up with that. I would expect more strengthening to continue in the second half. The other condition that in the second quarter, I think it's important to call out is we were lapping increased shipments that came ahead of the 2023 pricing actions of the prior year. And we also had a similar condition in '22 compared to '23. So that did play a little bit of impact, I think, when we look at shipments versus consumption. And then, in terms of retailers, they're always looking to be more efficient. That's not new. It's always I think a focus of theirs. But overall, we are not seeing at this time any unusual activity. So, I think just to give you a little bit of context on consumption as an impact, what was going on in the prior year and then how our retailers behaving, I think that would be the perspective I would want you to think about with McCormick. You want to get it? Yeah. As we think about where we are on the life cycle of the year, and we talked about Q2 being an important quarter for us, because it was the pivot quarter where pricing is -- we lose some of the protection of pricing, which we saw in the first quarter and last year, the shift of volume and particularly what makes us happy is that consumer volume going positive, which is great. There's some back-half assumptions on volume growth in Consumer, which were very -- we know the programs are working, but you still have to assume that the second half of the year is the biggest half and biggest quarter is the fourth quarter. So, while we're really pleased with the results, we realized the second half is important to continue that momentum and we believe we will. We're always looking at the guidance. I mean, you referenced tax, I'm kind of chuckling, because I think my first earnings call, we probably I think we had a big tax adjustment as similar and we talked about guidance for the year versus these things happen lumpily in the quarter or half. So, I'll take that one right off, 24% in the second half because our underlying rate is 24% to 25%, so that's roughly what we'll probably land. I mean, we do have the second half, if you think about built-in operating margin growth, we have volume growth, things like that. So, we feel like we've called it prudently. Obviously, if there's opportunities as things change, we want to keep our financial flexibility to make investments in some of these growth drivers that we're really seeing positive on. So, we want to have that flexibility, too. But I think we're really pleased going into the third quarter. We talked a bit about some of the consumer uncertainty, which impacts some of our Flavor Solutions business. We're always cautious there too, but I'd say we've called it pretty much down the middle with hopefully a lean in to the positive. I think, too, people sometimes forget the branded through service business, which really good margins and we like that portfolio and we're continuing to gain share. We keep coming up with opportunities. We talked about expanding McCormick Mayonesa into that category, things like that. So, there's really lots of opportunities on that side, which we like on the Flavor Solutions side. It's a diversified portfolio. That's I think the message and we continue to diversify and optimize and move toward more higher-margin product lines. Oh gosh, we could talk the whole earnings call on that one. It means, our CCI program has a long history of generating sustainable cost savings. We talked a little bit on this call about -- we're finalizing the transition to our new UK Flavor Solutions business in the second half, which will give us some tailwind into next year, which is great. But our CCI program -- we target all levels of the P&L. I mean, a lot of times programs will just look at cost of goods sold, raw material, things like that, which is an important part of our portfolio. We're looking at optimizing SG&A. A&P, when we talked about A&P a lot this year, we're actually spending A&P -- our guidance is high-single digits, but from an effectiveness perspective, we're actually spending low double digits and getting CCI savings as we optimize spend to touch more customers more effectively. So, those are examples everywhere along the P&L. I'd say, it's a program that's special because the ideas come from the bottom up in our organization as part of our culture to drive that, because we want to use it as fuel for growth, so we can drive the growth levers that we talked about this year at CAGNY and help drive that volume. So, I think there's a lot more opportunity and I look forward to Marcos helping drive that into the future, too. Well, I think in the back half, the guide implies almost like 5 basis points to 100 basis points and we say for the year 50 basis points to 100 basis points. So, we realized we had a really strong first half. As I said, pricing was large in the first quarter for us, that's going away into the second half. And the key is the volume growth. I mean, volume growth -- volume is great for a lot of things and it helps gross margin and mix and all that sort of stuff. So, I think we're comfortable with the guide we have. I wouldn't say right now I'd guide to the higher end at this point, but to give you all the reasons I said. Remember, some of the cost savings program we have like GOE was really first quarter into the second quarter. So, some of those are going away also. But it's still -- the trends we see in gross margin, the first -- the second half is higher than the first half traditionally, which is going to continue again, and we do see a nice trajectory there for gross margin over time as we continue our multiyear journey of getting back to kind of the pre-COVID gross margin levels. Good morning. Yeah. Yeah, I'll start. I mean, at the end of the day, the net sales guidance we gave for pricing and the results of what we showed, again, you have for the Consumer business for the second quarter was down a little under 1%, which we continue to see that in the second half. So that would suggest that the pricing actions we said we were going to do, the surgical pricing actions on a limited part of the portfolio, that's what shown up through net sales. Now what happens when that gets to shelf, that's a whole another story. And in addition to the things that we're doing on some of those items, there's other retailer actions that are happening too. Because as Brendan said before, this is a category -- our categories are growing. That's where people want to shop in more of the perimeter of the store. They're wanting to use products like ours to flavor these -- and manage cost inflation across protein and things like that. So, the retailers also are contributing to some of these things. We might not -- it might not be our price adjustments on items, that maybe other ones that they're seeing and operating in their stores too. So, I think there's a combination of factors that maybe skewing a little bit of the data you're seeing versus our internal kind of what we're actually reporting on these calls. Remember, going back to last year, we're lapping a really strong second half. A lot of the acceleration they've seen and great performance is really second-half focused last year. So, we're lapping a tough comp, I'd say. We've said it at the beginning of the year, I'll go back to that, I mean, one, we're really happy with the margin improvement we've experienced last year and we gave guidance for this fiscal year for the total company of about 80 basis points of OP margin improvement. And we said at the time, Flavor Solutions might be slightly ahead of that, but in the range of [0.8] (ph). Through the first half, Flavor Solutions was at I think at 80 basis points, so roughly around there. So again, we're always looking for improvement. I'd say that for the whole company, we're really comfortable with 50 basis points to 100 basis points. A lot of -- and as I said about a month ago, a lot depends on the volume numbers and the Consumer business continues to see volume growth that drives margin improvement. In Flavor Solutions, a bit of dip in the second quarter could put a little bit of pressure on margins, as I said, but we're expecting sequential improvement in Flavor Solutions. That's not going to be materially different than what we said at the beginning of the year, I'd say. Yeah, that was in the prepared remarks. We talked -- that was really in the reference in that section we're talking about pricing for the remainder of the year and similar segment trends -- similar company and segment trends for the remainder of the year. So, if you look at the pricing trends in Q2 versus prior year, approximately the same by segment and for total company. That really helps your model question."

To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on slide two for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As many of you have probably seen on the news this morning, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore. Our thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this terrible tragedy. We have activated a team and are monitoring the situation. We are pleased to start the year with a strong first quarter. Our performance reflects the early success of our prioritized investments to improve volume trends and drive profitable growth. I will begin my remarks this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some early signposts of success, as well as areas we continue to work on and review our growth plans. Mike will then go into more depth on the first quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook, and finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on slide four. In the first quarter, sales grew 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 3% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume and product mix, primarily driven by the pruning of low-margin business and our canning business divestiture. Underlying volume was flat compared to the prior year. Sequentially from the fourth quarter, volume trends improved in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. We believe this improvement is an indication of continued progress as we remain focused on driving quality top-line growth throughout our portfolio. In Consumer, volumes improved substantially from the fourth quarter in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth while continuing to benefit from pricing actions. In Asia Pacific, volume performance was impacted by the macro environment in China, as we expected. We continue to expect full year 2024 China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Outside of China, we delivered strong sales growth driven by both price and volume. In Flavor Solutions, our results were solid and growth was driven by price and underlying volume growth, partially offset by the impact of our canning divestiture. We are pleased with our performance recognizing many of our customers, including Consumer Product Companies or CPGs and Quick Service Restaurants or QSRs, continue to experience volume softness in their businesses. We are continuing to collaborate with our customers to navigate this challenging environment and we remain optimistic about our growth for the year. It's worth noting that volume trends and Flavor Solutions typically fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, largely attributable to customer activity, including new product launches, limited time offers, and their other promotional activity. As we said at the CAGNY conference, McCormick is a growth company, and 2024 is an important investment year to return to our long-term objectives. Our results demonstrate the early impact of investments we have made to fuel our top-line and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. We have a robust set of initiatives and continue to expect share gains in units to lead our trends and our results will build throughout 2024. Let me share some of our perspectives on industry trends. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. Our shared insights give us a very strong understanding of consumers flavor needs, preferences, behaviors, and trends. Consumers remain challenged. Two years of steep inflation has had an impact and many are exhibiting value seeking behavior. While food inflation is slowing, its compounded impact is still being felt by consumers. Budgets are stretched, resulting in choiceful spending decisions, a trend that is continuing from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, with higher inflation in the food service channel and slowing retail food prices, we broadly saw a shift from food away-from-home to food-at-home consumption in our major markets. We are also seeing improvement in center store categories and some softness in restaurant traffic across all regions. As we said, the current state of the consumer is not defined by any one trend, it remains dynamic, and we are responding with speed and agility. I am encouraged by the early success of our key initiatives. We have the right plans in place that are continually influenced by what matters most to our consumers and customers, and fit within our strategic priorities. Moving to slide five, let me highlight for the quarter some of the key signposts of our success that demonstrate we have the right plans in place. Starting with spices and seasonings. In Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China, we grew volumes. In the U.S., our unit share performance continues to improve and we drove dollar share gains in Eastern Europe. In recipe mixes, we strengthened our performance with volume growth in the Americas, reversing the trends from the fourth quarter. Recipe mixes were a significant driver of U.K. volume growth and homemade desserts were also a substantial driver of France's volume growth. In both, we realized both unit and dollar market share gains. Volume growth in our Flavors business is strong across key categories, including outpacing the category in alcoholic beverages and performance nutrition. Finally, we grew volume in branded foodservice and realized market share gains in spices and seasonings and on Tabletop in hot sauces. Before I get into our growth plans, let me touch on some areas where there is some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like Frozen and Asian. In Americas Consumer, importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the improved volume trends in our core categories is beginning to offset these declines. For mustard in Americas Consumer, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to experience extremely low price points for private label, which is impacting our consumption and driving down category dollars. While performance in mustard improved relative to the fourth quarter, we still have work ahead of us. We plan to drive further volume improvement by narrowing price gaps and increasing promotions, new products, including Creamy Dill Pickle, and importantly through recent distribution wins. Moving to hot sauce, in Americas Consumer of consumption, volume trends improved from the fourth quarter, particularly coinciding with our successful Super Bowl activation campaign. Reflecting on our first quarter performance, it highlights two dynamics. First, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our growth plans remain consistent, fueling growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's RedHot brand marketing, with Frank's activated year-round for the first time, as well as exciting innovation aligned with consumer trends and expanding distribution. Second, recently we have seen a surge in $1 price point trial sizes from new and existing small players, which is incremental to the category and is pressuring our share performance. We remain the leader in this attractive, fragmented and growing category. New buyers present a great opportunity to win new households using our growth levers, as well as our scale and capabilities. In Flavors, our growth with Quick Serve Restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower QSR traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own business, in both Americas and EMEA. We are focused on working with our customers to support their innovation plans and continue to diversify our customer base over time. Before I talk through our growth plans in detail, let me touch on spices and seasonings. At a global level, we are pleased with the growth and consumption we delivered in the quarter. Specifically looking at U.S. spices and seasonings, we are driving significant improvements. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf, and we are recapturing distribution points, and our sequential improvement led to positive unit share gains at the end of the quarter. In addition, our growth is supported by our increased brand marketing and new products. Lastly, we expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results during the second half of the year, following most of our customers shelf resets at the end of the second quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on slide six, which are leading our strong first quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and beyond. Brand marketing, new products, and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies, and customer engagement continue to be the initiatives behind our growth levers. Starting with brand marketing, our plans across all categories are supported by our global brand marketing initiatives. We are prioritizing investments to connect with consumers and fuel growth. Our differentiated brand marketing is driven by a combination of factors. In addition to maintaining a high share of voice, we are committed to having the best content in our categories. Content that inspires and educates consumers and reaches them at the right points on their path to purchase and their flavor journey. From flavor exploration and menu planning, to shopping and cooking, and even to eating and sharing the experience online. In Q1, brand marketing spend was up significantly compared to the prior year as expected. This increase was broad-based across all regions and was an important driver in improving volumes. Through our efforts across multiple channels, particularly in retail media, we are driving further household penetration and increasing buy rates across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes, and condiments. Our holiday campaigns across our regions proved successful. Our marketing campaigns in the Americas highlight our everyday value and point-of-difference to consumers and are supporting our improved volume trends and share improvement. Our Frank Super Bowl activation campaign with Jason Kelce, now a retired NFL player, was very successful. We gained new buyers and media and consumer sentiment, as well as engagement from other big brands, was incredibly positive. We continue to benefit from new products and packaging. It is one of the primary drivers of our growth and as we said at CAGNY, the performance of our launches continues to improve. We are continuing to realize growth from our 2023 launches. For example, our Cholula sauces and recipe mixes are driving new buyers to the category and are exceeding our expectations since launch, and we continue to build U.S. distribution and are also launching both formats in Canada this year. The rollout of our U.S. Everyday Herbs & Spices portfolio is on plan and expected to be fully shifted by the end of the second quarter. Our Nadiya Hussain range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes continue to drive our innovation performance and expand household penetration with younger consumers. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, with our renovated recipe mixes, we have opportunities to win more dinner occasions with new global cuisine seasonings in both Americas and the AMEA and reshaping the portfolio by shifting offerings to meet consumers growing preference for non-red meat proteins. In Seasoning Blend, an exciting growth opportunity we mentioned at CAGNY, we are launching new Lawry's, seasoning blends in large sizes, which offer a value price point to consumers. And we are really excited about the Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format we just launched and are looking forward to another campaign featuring Jason Kelce. In Flavor Solutions, we are leveraging our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors, to win new customers, diversifying our customer base, and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our flavors customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. We are collaborating with many of our customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages. Our heat-brief win rates are strong across our regions. We continue to dedicate resources where we have the right to win. In Branded Food Service, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching a Cattlemen's Hawaiian Barbecue flavor, expanding our Seasonings portfolio with Ducros line extensions, and extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our consumer segment into this channel. Let's turn to category management, where I'd like to review our revenue management efforts and expanding distribution. First, revenue management remains a capability and we have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. We continue to take a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors. Our price investments are primarily focused in Americas consumer, where they impact about 15% of our portfolio in that segment. Revenue management will continue to be an important tool for driving growth, and we will consistently leverage real-time analytics and insights to refine our plans. In terms of expanding distribution, we continue to make progress on restoring a majority of the distribution that was lost due to supply issues. We have secured winds and new distribution. To further strengthen our value proposition in EMEA, we have grown distribution in the fast growing discount channel, and in the U.S., our Lawry's opening price point is expanding across the stores of a leading discounter. And in China, we are expanding in small format stores, which have grown rapidly in recent years, as well as into third and fourth-tier cities. We are meeting the consumer where they live and shop. Let me briefly mention our heat platform. As you heard in my remarks, heat-infused products span our portfolio and are driving growth. We expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for McCormick. Consumers, particularly younger generations, continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands and our meaningful scale and expertise that we have been building for decades. To wrap up, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories, and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. As we look ahead to 2024, we are maintaining our outlook. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we expect our top-line to be at the mid to high-end of our guidance range, given the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We are confident in our initiatives and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also continue to reflect on the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024. Before I pass the call to Mike, let me reiterate a few points. We are deliberately focused on attractive, high-growth categories across both segments, resulting in a significant long-term tailwind to drive profitable growth. That said, it is crucial that we continue to capitalize on this position of strength. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavorful exploration, and trusted brands continue to be very strong. And, importantly, consumer enjoyment in cooking is growing. We remain dedicated to improving volumes. We continue to refine our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. And, you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Now, over to Mike.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide eight. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, reflecting 3% of pricing benefit, offset by a 1% volume and mix decline. As expected, volumes were impacted by our strategic decision to exit DSD, Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas. The exit of a private label product line, and the divestiture of a small canning business in EMEA. Underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, reflecting a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 3%. In our consumer segment, constant currency sales growth of 1% reflects a 3% increase in pricing actions, offset by a 2% volume decline, which is due to a 1% impact from the DSD business exit I just mentioned, lower volume and product mix in the Americas, specifically in Prepared Food Categories, including Frozen and Asian, consistent with our expectations, and the impact of the macro environment in China. On slide nine, consumer sales in the Americas were comparable to last year. Contribution from price was offset by a volume and mix decline of 3%. This decline was fully attributable to the DSD exit and lower volume and product mix in the Prepared Food Categories I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 8%, with a 5% increase in pricing actions and 3% volume growth. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were down 5%, driven by a 6% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we drove high single-digit sales growth with price and volume contributing equally, and the growth was broad-based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and slide 12, we grew first quarter constant currency sales by 2%, with pricing contributing 2% and volume contributing 1%, partially offset by a 1% decline due to the divestiture of the canning business and the exit of a private label product line in EMEA. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 3%, reflecting a 2% contribution from price and 1% growth in volume and product mix. Sales growth was led by Flavor, most notably in performance nutrition and branded food service. In EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 1%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business. Pricing actions of 4% were partially offset by lower volume and product mix of 2%, primarily attributable to the exit of the private label product line I mentioned earlier. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency, with a 4% contribution from pricing and 1% volume growth. Outside of China, sales remain negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts some of our quick service restaurant customers are experiencing in Southeast Asia. As seen on slide 16, gross profit margins expanded by 140 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix, the benefit of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI, and our Global Operating Effectiveness Program or GOE, as well as effective price realization. As we look to the second quarter, we expect gross margins to modestly expand compared to the year ago period, as we realized our highest level of pricing and cost recovery in the second quarter of 2023. This trend may differ from our historical cadence, where gross margin increases sequentially every quarter throughout the year. However, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year. Now moving to slide 17, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the first quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing and research and development investments, which are partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points. Brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results, and we anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in an increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment was up 2%, with minimal impact from currency. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 15% and included a 1% currency impact. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, and in the first quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus the prior year in this segment. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 18. Our interest expense was comparable to the prior year. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% compared to 21.8% in the year ago period. Our tax rate in the prior year benefited from discrete tax items. We expect these benefits to occur later in the year for us in 2024. As a result, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We're the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash-flow results. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 20, first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.59 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the results from McCormick de Mexico joint venture partially offset by higher adjusted effective tax rate. On slide 21, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in the first quarter $138 million compared to $103 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements. We returned $113 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on slide 22. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Given the momentum in the first quarter, we expect to be closer to the midpoint to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we continue to expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses. Through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize and we continue to expect to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic headwinds. Starting in the second quarter, we will have lapped the impact of the DSD and private label product line business exits. The divestiture of the Giotti canning business will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio. The impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. Finally in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility and demand in China, we continue to believe in a long-term growth trajectory of the China business. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low single-digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion, as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings, and we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in discrete impacts. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As we head into the second quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes. We expect a drive volume improvement, with some pressure expected in Flavor Solutions due to the trends Brendan mentioned earlier. Fully wrapped the impact of pricing actions we took in the prior year and activated a significant portion of our price cap management efforts, and continue our investments in brand marketing, as our programs are working and driving growth. As a result, our operating profit will likely be less robust for the second quarter. However, we continue to anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.\nBrendan Foley : Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on slide 23. First quarter results in our volume trajectory demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment to consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantage categories across segments. We are able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our GOE and CCI programs, to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the quarter, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving the mid-to-high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions and reiterate my confidence that together we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now, for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar : Great, thanks. Good morning, Brendan and Mike.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar : Maybe to start off, your first quarter organic sales obviously came in better than I think the Street had forecast and sounds like maybe better than you might have initially expected, but of course, it's a seasonally smaller quarter for McCormick as well. And while you did confirm the full year sales growth range, obviously it was notable in your comments about having increased confidence and achieving the mid-to-high end of your constant currency sales growth range for the full year. So I was hoping maybe you could give us a sense of some of the specifics of what gives you that greater confidence now than when you first gave guidance last quarter?\nBrendan Foley: Well, thanks Andrew for the question. Maybe just to open up with, a couple of remarks that I think drive at the heart of your question. We did have a strong quarter. We drove a little bit more on sales, which does give us confidence to be in that mid to upper half of our range. And I think importantly, we accomplished the things that we said we would do, and we made a lot of good progress. We drove sequential improvement, volume improvement in our core categories, especially on spices and seasonings. We said this would be a year of investment, and we were able to quickly execute the programs that we intended to get out in the market. That was an example of increased brand marketing, new product launches are performing well from 2023, and that targeted price gap management execution, and at the same time, we did expand margins. So we are pleased with the results, yet it is the start of the year, and it's our smallest quarter as you called out, and so we're keeping it in perspective. But this is strong progress, and so I think that gives us some of that confidence going into the rest of the year. As we noted on the call or probably as you expect, our pricing assumptions haven't changed. So this doesn't imply that volumes are improving as we go through the year. We have targeted investments, and we continue to expect to improve those volume trends as the year progresses and to drive volume growth during the second half of the year. We're focused on what we can control, and we're confident in those initiatives that we've called out, and hopefully you've heard the proof points that we've cited. We don't necessarily guide by quarter or segment or region, but we can provide some additional color in that. From the segment level, we'd expect those volumes to be relatively similar. We see that same volume growth in both segments in the second half, and as we did call out, the Flavor Solutions volume does fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, so that's something that we still expect to see across our business, largely attributed just to customer activity. But we do feel like there is a lot of good momentum, I think that we've established. The drivers of what's delivering this, we made substantial investments in the first half of the year on increased brand marketing. So it already happened in Q1. We expect to do some more of that in Q2. We also have new product launches coming out in 2024. For instance, we called out that flavor maker line that's going into bricks and mortar or we have a lot of Frank's innovation coming out in the marketplace as we lead into the grilling season, and we're really quite pleased with our category management and renovation across our portfolio. So I think that would speak to our confidence in the year as we continue to move forward.\nAndrew Lazar : Great. Then, I know volumes, specifically in Consumer Americas, I think were down about 6% in the fourth quarter last year, and as you noted, down a much more modest, sort of less than 3% in the first quarter. Would you expect Consumer Americas volume to sort of continue to improve sequentially from here? And again, in that segment, that it could inflect a positive during the second half of the year? Or are some of the headwinds you pointed out that still exist in Consumer Americas still more of a challenge to that?\nBrendan Foley: Let me give more context around Q1, and then that might also help provide sort of a foundation for how to think about the year to go. The volume decline of 2.6% in the Americas for Q1, it was really coming through two key factors. One is that DSD exit that we've spoken about quite a bit over the last four quarters. So that definitely was one of the drivers of that 2.6%, and then that decline in the prepared food categories as we noted on the call. So, if you exclude those two factors, volume growth in Consumer Americas would have been flat to slightly positive. So I think that's kind of a, helps to sort of set a foundation for how we think about the year to go. Also, in our key categories in Q1, growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes was pretty healthy. It was offset by declines in mustard and hot sauce. So, that's other context I think we would provide against Q1. As we look forward to the year, we expect volumes to continue to sequentially improve and drive volume growth as we get into the second half. So, that would probably be the best perspective I could provide on that.\nMike Smith: I think \u2013 to think about too, this is not just about Americas Consumer. I mean, we're building volume globally in the consumer side, and a lot of the same brand building activities, such as increased A&P, we talked about this in the call, is in all regions. So we continue to support those brands globally in each of our regions, not just Americas.\nAndrew Lazar : Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nBrendan Foley: Sure.\nPeter Galbo: Mike, maybe just to follow up on Andrew's question, I think if you strip out DSD, the exit in the first quarter, you still kind of had a ship ahead or consumption ahead of what the scanner data would have said in North American Consumers. So maybe, I know you probably don't want to give like basis point level detail, but if you could kind of rank between untracked, some of that co-manufacturing you do, some of the upside drivers relative, I guess to the scanner data that drove kind of the positive variant in the quarter.\nMike Smith: Peter, thanks for your question on that. On an apples-to-apples basis, our consumption is roughly in line with our sales and we are shipping to consumption. What's probably driving the U.S. consumption, lagging on Americas consumer sales is we had good growth in Latin America and Canada and that contributed to our total growth. But we also delivered growth in unmeasured, excluding that DSD business exit that we talked about. So we do expect and continue the alignment between consumption and shipments moving forward. We don't really believe that there's any sort of inventory movement that we can call out at this point in time. But it's also important to call out that in that unmeasured growth was primarily driven by e-commerce. It represents this globally for us, about 10% of our total consumer sales, and so that's pretty healthy and positive. But we've seen double digit growth in all of 2023 in e-commerce and did again in Q1. So we continue to believe that e-commerce is a growth channel, and we do continue to put resources up against it. But coming back to sort of the top of your question on the influences on measured channels, I would probably think about that as one thing to consider and think about. But largely, we really believe that our shipments and consumption are broadly in line with.\nPeter Galbo : Got it. No, that's helpful. And then maybe guys, just I wanted to clarify on China, because the slide seemed to say maybe two things. I think in the China Consumer business, which I know is kind of more branded food service, there was some weakness. But then on China Flavor Solutions, you talk about strength in QSRs in China. So just wanted to maybe unpack a bit more on those because it seemed to be saying two different things and get a better read kind of between those two sub-segments. Thanks very much.\nBrendan Foley: Sure. I'll make a couple of comments here, and Mike might have some things to add. We are not thinking about China any differently than what we said last quarter. It largely met our expectations for the first quarter, both from a consumer segment perspective and a flavor solution segment perspective. And we continue to expect that for total 2024, China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Broadly our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious. I mean, there are several reasons to continue to think that way, persisting unemployment with young adults, reduced consumer confidence. Consumers are still somewhat reluctant to spend. In our business, and that falls into our consumer segment, is sales to smaller independent restaurants and they are losing some traffic to the larger QSR chains. That might be where you're hearing us say two different things. So off of that is some perspective around that. Yet, like we do with other regions, we have plans in flight to address how we're looking at China and the changing trends of Chinese consumers. We do expect our Flavor Solutions business to be stronger in 2024, just based on the trends that we're seeing. So, that's I think, some of the perspective. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Smith: Yeah, I think, we were in China about two months ago and saw a lot of these trends with QSRs, big established QSRs were starting to gain share and drive some traffic into their stores versus that kind of smaller mom and pop type stores. I mean, I would just give you context to this kind of talk as we talk about our whole Flavor Solutions business. The QSR business in some parts of the world, like China, is really doing well. Other parts, it's a bit challenged. So as you think about our guidance, those are things that you can talk about the Flavor Solutions business is lumpy in part due to the fact that, our CPG customers and QSR customers control new product launches and there's foot traffic and things like that. But China has started off strong on the QSR side, which is great.\nPeter Galbo : Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport : Hey, thanks for the question.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMax Gumport : The last quarter you talked about making, good progress on restoring distribution that was lost to past supply issues. And it sounded like you're reiterating that commentary and that you still have line of sight to making some good progress on getting that distribution back following customer resets the middle of this year. I was just curious if you could give us a bit more color on some of the updated insights you've gotten over the past couple of months since we last heard from you on what you are seeing, what you are hearing with regard to customer wins in U.S. spices and seasoning. Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks for the question, Max. Yeah, as a reminder, the proactive discontinuations over the course of the last two years make up roughly 50% of the TDP losses that we experienced. So just a reminder, as background on that and then of the TDP that we lost really due to supply, we've recovered really quite a bit of it, not entirely all of it, but a lot of it. I think the context, I would add on top of that in terms of what we're seeing right now, across our core categories, we're really making pretty good progress. So, for example, just on recipe mix, our total distribution points were up again in Q1 and at this point, we probably have the highest TDPs that we've seen in that category, probably compared to the last three or four years, and our share of TDPs is really quite healthy and strong. On hot sauce, again our TDPs were up in Q1, and we have the highest total TDP points on that business too, in the last three years. Mustard, similar situation, TDPs were up again in Q1, and we have the highest total TDPs and on that one, the share of TDPs in the last three years. So, a number of those categories, we feel like we're doing quite well and progressing quite nicely, up against this. In spices and seasonings, we're also making pretty good progress. In about five of our top six segments, we're seeing TDP growth. Broadly right now, TDP shares is flat for us, but we expect that to improve as we go through the year. A lot of these resets, when you think about any category or mostly that tend to happen in the middle of the year. We think towards the end of Q2, those will start to reflect on shelf. So I wouldn't say for all of Q2, but definitely as we go into the back half of the year, we think there'll be more full reflection of the gains that we think we've won.\nMax Gumport : Great. And then one more on Flavor Solutions. So, it's nice to see the positive volume growth to start the year. It was a bit earlier than we all expected, at least from RC. I know you called out that this segment can have fluctuations, whether it's due to limited time offerings or promotional timing, new product launches, what have you. With that comment, are there any things you know about right now that would make you think we could see some step back in Q2? Or is it more just trying to let us know that this is a segment that is more volatile and there's potentially reason to think that we could see a dip back to flatter performance in Q2? I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nMike Smith: Yeah, this is Mike. I think you're right. We're really happy with the first quarter performance there, the sequential improvement. But, some of our regions, the QSR business is pretty material, such as the EMEA. It's very public, some of the customers coming out talking about the food traffic. So, I think as Brendan said in the call, the second quarter, there is a bit of headwind there on the Flavor Solutions side, so I wouldn't be surprised by that. But, as Brendan said, too, the second half, both for Consumer and Flavor Solutions volume, we're expecting strength. I think about our performance, too, in halves versus quarters, because quarters can get very weak. That makes a difference sometimes. So, within the first half, we're still calling for kind of flattish volume, second half volume growth across the business. So, think about it in those terms, too.\nMax Gumport : Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson : So I guess, I wanted to dig in a little more on the Americas Consumer business and just maybe provide a little more context, Brendan, Mike, on the point on spices and seasonings and the unit share kind of improvement. Just is that was that coming through faster than you expected? Is that tracking as you thought and just retail sales broadly in January in particular accelerated for the for the whole industry? A little bit of weather and some of that channel shift that you alluded to seems like it\u2019s gone back to the same similar trend through February. Was that \u2013 do you think you've held that unit share through existing the quarter through February or was there some bigger uplift towards the end of the quarter there?\nBrendan Foley: Yeah, Adam I'm happy to provide more context on spices and seasonings. Just maybe speaking first to broadly what we saw in the industry, I think through the first quarter. As our prepared remarks noted, if you think about what appeared to be a very sort of challenging, difficult Q4, we started to see more center of store improvement compared to Q4 broadly, and maybe that came at the expense of food-away-from home to some degree. Certainly a cold winter always benefits McCormick. We like to see people make a lot of chili, and so that always is great for part of our recipe mixed business. But, what we're speaking specifically to spices and seasonings here. So, we tend to think about this from a different perspective. What's really driving I think our performance right now is, I would point out maybe a couple of things that are benefiting our business. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf and we're rolling out more of that. It's just pulling through and more of it will be complete by the end of the second quarter. So we're at 75% at the end of Q4. We believe that we're obviously somewhere between 75% and 100% at this point in time, and so that's driving improvement. We are recapturing distribution points too, and we think that sequential improvement led to some positive. That plus our increase in advertising and the velocity of our new \u2013 coming from our new packaging led to unit share gains at the end of the quarter. That increase in advertising, I think certainly was one of the things that we think led a lot of our positive trends in our business in spices and seasonings. So, these are some of the things that we've spoken to I think from not only the fourth quarter call but also at CAGNY and I would just reiterate them here. The collection or the integration of all of that together we believe is driving the right level of performance on the business overall.\nAdam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up from Mike, just the comments on the second quarter and the gross margin that will be up modestly year-over-year. I guess I'm just trying to make sense of from a \u2013 should we be thinking about SG&A percent of sales similar to the first quarter? It doesn't seem like your top line, maybe a little bit of setback in Flavor Solutions sequentially in terms of the top line. But it doesn't seem like you're talking about a big setback probably in terms of the overall company sales. I know last year was a tougher comp on price cost, but I guess I'm trying to just make sure I understand why it would seem like the profit growth, if not the profit dollars themselves are decelerating.\nMike Smith: I think, Adam, maybe think about it this way. I mean, second quarter is kind of an inflection point for us. The pricing which for the first quarter was about 2.7% and think about it for the year is going to be at 1%. So, second, third, and fourth quarters is coming down. While volume is turning positive and we're getting sequentially improvements, in that second quarter you don't have as much cover for pricing and your volume while it's improving isn't to the level it is in the second half. So that is \u2013 in second quarter, as I said in the remarks, we're activating some of our price cap management activities more than in the first quarter. So that puts a little pressure on the sales line and the profit line. But we're confident those investments, including increased A&P, which we had in the first quarter but also in the second quarter too, will contribute to driving sequential volume improvement in both Q2 but in the second half. So, I think what you're getting a little bit is a bit of a \u2013 like I said, it's an inflection point before the volume growth, which we'll talk about in the second half. So, it puts a little pressure on margins. We're still having positive margin improvement versus last year, but if you think about last year, that was like the sweet spot of when our pricings were really going in, overcoming the cost impacts. We talked about that last second quarter. So that was \u2013 at that point our margins were up 300 basis points from the prior year, I think it was. But we still see, again back to the first half, second half really good margin improvement in the second half for the first half. The first half is about investments. We benefited in the first quarter also, the wrap GOE programs, things like that too, which did help the first quarter, but a lot of moving parts in the second. That's why we tried to give you a little bit of summary in the script.\nAdam Samuelson : The color is appreciated. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Just a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Can you remind us again what percent of the portfolio in the U.S. are you executing this price gap strategy? I think you said it's 50%? And maybe a little more color on what segments you're working on right now and what you're learning from that. Secondarily, I think you mentioned some dollar trial sizes in hot sauces. I haven't seen that. Can you explain a little bit why you think that's incremental to the category? Is your competition doing it? And if so, are they gaining any share as a result, or is it really just helping everybody? Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Thanks, Rob. So, let me address \u2013 I just want to make sure I don't forget your second question as I address yours. With regard to price gap management, I mean I think I just would go back to confirming what we've said also at CAGNY, is that that program and those efforts, which is quite targeted on a skew-by-skew basis, represents less than 15% of our Americas\u2026\nRobert Moskow: 15%\nMike Smith: Yeah, 15%, its 15 not 50.\nRobert Moskow: I thought you maybe said 50%, and it's 15%.\nBrendan Foley: And it's really being applied to targeted parts of our spices and seasonings category and recipe mixes. So, we're also taking price gap management efforts selectively across other regions. I would say EMEA is an example of that. But this is just part of, I think, good tactical blocking and tackling on the parts of our portfolio where we think maybe a price point just simply isn't at a place where it could be successful. So, that's the color I would add to that. Now, specifically on your question on hot sauce, the background I would first provide, hey, this is an attractive category. There's always, particularly more so than most categories, a lot of new competition always entering in the category. So, this is something that we live and operate with all the time. We do have underlying strength in our base business on hot sauce and really healthy consumer loyalty. Our plans remain pretty consistent. We're fueling a lot of growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's brand marketing. In fact, Frank's is going to be activated all 12 months of the year in terms of being on air, and that's the first time we're doing that. And to really tap into the growth that we've seen in this segment, and we are also expanding distribution. But our underlying trends are pretty good. Now, more recently, particularly in like the end of the fourth quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've seen retailers push the concept of trial sizes, like at $1 price point. And it's created, obviously, a lot of consumer value when you have just a really low opening price point of $1 for something that's like an ounce or less of product. But it's resulted in significant unit growth. It's been driving down sort of the category of volume and dollar growth that maybe we had been seeing, going into this time period. So that is pressuring our share performance, particularly on units, if you might imagine. A lot of this is driven by gifting during the holidays, and so you could see sort of the big spike, and then it's kind of decelerating since then. But, we still believe it's something that's contributing positively to the category because it's adding new users to the category. We've evaluated, how much of it's coming from new households versus existing households, and the majority of its coming from new households into the category. So that's always a positive. We're taking some of these learnings and looking at, our own efforts at having a trial size and competing in this kind of promotional area. Because we think it's obviously anything that drives trial and awareness in the category we think is healthy. And importantly, it's also building upon actions that we already have in place behind hot sauce, which is a lot of innovation coming out this year. I would say, particularly a lot on Frank's, but also Cholula. We're increasing the A&P support on all the brands. Where we have traditional promotional periods for these categories, we're just making sure they're at the right times during the year and on key use of education. Obviously, the summer certainly lends itself to that. Like think of the Mayo too, so that's the context on hot sauce.\nRobert Moskow : Okay, I got it. And just to follow up on the 15%, as you make it through the year, just optically we see market share data that still doesn't look like it's where you want it to be from $1 basis in spices and seasonings. Is it possible that the other 85% of the portfolio might also need to be addressed in terms of price gaps? Or are you comfortable that you don't need to take any action there?\nBrendan Foley: I think we're comfortable that we don't need to take any action. And we are, pretty precise, if I might say that in terms of how we apply this and where it best needs to be applied. But I also have to say, we're constantly evaluating this. So every month we're looking at data and results and deciding whether or not, something's in the right place. But, I think we have a lot of confidence that we're focusing on the right, percentage of the business. But, to speak more specifically, I think to just share perspective around that. While we don't guide to market share of a specificity, I think the trends in our business right now are going in the right direction, and in many ways delivering against what we would expect to see, which is, that focus on share improvement for us as we're looking at our business plans, first begins with improving unit growth. And then we expect dollar, to sort of follow on top of that. But, like in U.S. spices and seasonings we're seeing that type of performance right now. So just also appreciate, this is a big integrated effort with a lot of other activities, too, including increased brand marketing, innovation, price spec architecture, other category management efforts that we're putting forth. So, I wouldn't single out any one of those levers, but actually they all work together, and that's sort of the perspective I would add on top of your question.\nRobert Moskow : Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Smith : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on that targeted price gap management in the U.S. consumer spices and seasonings business, particularly in terms of phasing as you've built up or are you targeting 15% of the portfolio, meaning was it more targeted in the fourth quarter? You made some progress against the 15% that you're targeting in the first quarter, and there's still some more to go in these categories where you see the opportunity to use your price gap management tools to improve share. Should we expect that to continue to build into the second quarter?\nMike Smith: Hey, Matt. Let me kick off here, and then Mike [inaudible]. I think as you think about that 15%, again, I would stress 15, not 50, is that is a total look at the year. So, indeed, I would say our Q1 isn't necessarily at that level yet, and we would expect to start to hit that type of percentage of our business as we go through the year. So, just quickly off the top, I wanted to help provide some of that context around your question, Mike.\nMike Smith: No, and Matt, good question. And just as I said in the script, the second quarter is a bit of pressure because it does more activation in the second quarter. So, you're right, a little bit in the fourth, more in the first. Second quarter is when it's really almost fully activated quite nicely so. But, again, these are investments that drive that volume growth building throughout the year, which we \u2013 the early results of the fourth and first quarter investments have been very positive, combined with the A&P and things like Brendan just mentioned, so that holistic program.\nMatthew Smith : Thank you for that. And you talked about some particular portions of the portfolio in the U.S. that are challenged, particularly mustard or your frozen prepared foods. Can you talk about some of the \u2013 your outlook for the improvement in those categories? Do you have plans in place to address some of the lower price points in mustard, and is it really just the consumer recovery that's going to drive the improvement in your frozen prepared foods?\nBrendan Foley: So, I'll speak first to mustard. We just, again, readdressed sort of the context and the background on this. We definitely are seeing sort of a lot of low price points in private label, fairly low, which impacted our consumption, and it's driving down the category dollars, but importantly, it's impacting, our trajectory on consumption. So, we do plan to improve those trends in 2024. Largely, I think we're going to look at increasing promotional programs. We have a big grilling season, quite excited, actually, about the grilling season coming up. Mustards a big part of that as are a number of items within our portfolio. That plus, just making sure we are at the right price points, I think, across that business. We're also strengthening distribution, too, which will strengthen trends on top of that. So, that's a perspective on mustard. It will continue to get better, but as we were talking about in the fourth quarter, I don't know that we saw \u2013 what we saw in the first quarter was, contrary to what we were expecting as we start to implement those plans, particularly as we get to the grilling season. On the prepared foods category that we spoke to, we're riding the trends right now in the marketplace, and I think that's what you would expect to see us \u2013 how we would see us perform. It's a smaller part of our portfolio. We would not kind of call it this part of that core, and so we are really, I think, just watching the trends, making sure we follow what's going on in the category, and we're treating it much like in that manner.\nMike Smith: Yeah, I think about it, too. You think about \u2013 we've talked about our portfolio management and this is part of that. We're making sure that items we have in our portfolio, just whether on the consumer or Flavor Solution side, we can improve business that doesn't meet our target, so you'll see some of that probably in this area too, but we won't be calling it out as a separate item.\nMatthew Smith: Thank you for that. I can pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on just the shelf resets coming later in the second quarter. Is this incremental from a shelf space standpoint? I mean, is there going to be, depending on how the timing goes, the potential for some favorable shipment timing as we think about the second quarter? I would assume that's not factored into your outlook. I just want to understand kind of the moving parts there, and also kind of if that's the key driver of this expanded shelf set. Thanks.\nBrendan Foley: Well, we do believe that when we gain in TDPs or distribution, we do that as incremental to our presence in the market at that time. I think speaking to its impact on the second quarter, we feel like we've got that called in our outlook for the rest of the year. So I don't know if there's anything specific I want to identify for the second quarter behind this, and when exactly all that stuff ships, etc. I think that's a level of detail we just probably wouldn't be getting into at this point.\nMike Smith: I think, Thomas, maybe as your saying, I think you are kind of focusing on the shelf renovation with the new bottles. That's been rolling out from the end of last year into this year, and that's really not a big shipment, that's what we're replacing. It's kind of going \u2013 it's not a big reset. It's the same size bottle basically. It fits on a roll bin, so we're just kind of filling the pipeline with that. So you're not going to see a big spike. Now, you will see better velocity and things like that, which is why we did it, and that will build throughout the year. Some of the resets we talked about with winning new business on other categories, those shelf sets happen sometime in the second quarter and will benefit us in the second half. So there's kind of two different thoughts there as you think about it. And welcome to the call. It's your first call with us, Thomas.\nTom Palmer : Thank you. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson : Great. Thanks. Just one up-front question, two mechanical ones. So I just want to go back, I guess, for the last time, the last question, just to kind of the delta we're seeing in the track channel data, which clearly all of us look at, and then what you did in overall consumer in Americas was better. And I think I heard you say like Latin America was doing well. I know e-comm sounds like it's growing double digit. But I'm still trying to get a little bit more color, because I feel like if e-comm had been growing double digit or Latin America kind of had already been doing well, like there's got to be some delta in there that's driving the difference between what we're seeing in that track channel data, relative to what you report, because it clearly was much better in Q1 versus, let's say, the prior three years. So then as we're all looking at that data going forward, like should we I guess think that you will be tracking nicely ahead of that data given the same drivers or maybe not, because you are also saying you shift to consumption, but it's not what we see, and it's not what we've seen for the past like 11 quarters. So just there was something in there, and that's why we're all asking, but I just didn't really get it.\nMike Smith: Well, Rob, I think there's possibly two different questions there. I'll make an attempt at what I think you are getting at, which is what we're seeing in our business, and we read our business through Circana, and that's a much broader, more refined view of our categories, and so we are reflecting that kind of data in our performance as we talk about it. Compared to what Nielsen might be reporting, I think traditionally over time we've seen differences in that reporting. We don't really reconcile that on the call or do anything of that nature, but there have been at times a difference in what Nielsen might be reporting in terms of how they are capturing the category versus the more refined, higher level, broader view as we look at spices and seasonings in our category. So that might address part of your question. Now, the other half of that could be, it's about unmeasured channels, etc., and I would go back to the comments that I made earlier that we largely see everything pretty much being in line between shipments and consumption. We are getting a lot of strong growth in e-commerce, as I called out earlier in the call. So that certainly is something that could create a difference in the numbers and the metrics, and obviously good performance in Canada and Latin America. I'm going to pause to see if maybe we thoughtfully addressed, I think.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah, no, I think that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. Totally get it. I just thought I'd ask one last time. And then just quickly on the Mexico business, the JV, I know guidance is for mid-teens. I think its mid-teens growth for the year. You put up like 50% in Q1. So maybe just kind of, if you could just discuss kind of what actually did occur to drive that growth in Q1. And then given what we saw in Q1 should \u2013 like why do you think you'd still grow mid-teens if you are already so ahead?\nBrendan Foley: No, our McMex\u2019s [ph] joint venture had a great first quarter. I mean it's comping against a weaker first quarter too, so there's some of that in there. It's a little bit too early to call it the year. Just like here, there's the economy in Mexico. There's a lot of price volume things that are going through also as they've managed the year. So again, strong underlying business and we\u2019re really happy with it, but yes, we're hoping the rest of the year is just as strong as the first quarter, but it's a little bit too early to call on that one.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Alright, alright, fair enough. And then just quickly, Mike.\nBrendan Foley: I'm glad you asked that question, because we don't get a lot. I mean, it's such a large part of our portfolio. It gets ignored because it's below operating profit, but very profitable business. We have dominant \u2013 well, not dominant, but we have real strong brand positions down there across a couple of categories. And we export into the U.S., too, mayonnaise and other things too. So it's really, really good business for us.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah, and it was actually a core driver of net income. Anyway, and then I guess just Mike, quickly. I don't think I heard you speak to interest expense guidance, but you do frequently provide that. So I don't know if you have that, and that's all I have.\nBrendan Foley: The fact that we didn't provide it means it's not really that material. We only \u2013 I think last year was the first year we provided it, but it was roughly equal for the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect a whole lot of change for the year.\nRob Dickerson: Cool. Thank you so much. Perfect.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Freiha for any final comments.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you, and thanks to all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. This concludes our conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brendan Foley",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As many of you have probably seen on the news this morning, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore. Our thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this terrible tragedy. We have activated a team and are monitoring the situation. We are pleased to start the year with a strong first quarter. Our performance reflects the early success of our prioritized investments to improve volume trends and drive profitable growth. I will begin my remarks this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some early signposts of success, as well as areas we continue to work on and review our growth plans. Mike will then go into more depth on the first quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook, and finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on slide four. In the first quarter, sales grew 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 3% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume and product mix, primarily driven by the pruning of low-margin business and our canning business divestiture. Underlying volume was flat compared to the prior year. Sequentially from the fourth quarter, volume trends improved in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. We believe this improvement is an indication of continued progress as we remain focused on driving quality top-line growth throughout our portfolio. In Consumer, volumes improved substantially from the fourth quarter in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth while continuing to benefit from pricing actions. In Asia Pacific, volume performance was impacted by the macro environment in China, as we expected. We continue to expect full year 2024 China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Outside of China, we delivered strong sales growth driven by both price and volume. In Flavor Solutions, our results were solid and growth was driven by price and underlying volume growth, partially offset by the impact of our canning divestiture. We are pleased with our performance recognizing many of our customers, including Consumer Product Companies or CPGs and Quick Service Restaurants or QSRs, continue to experience volume softness in their businesses. We are continuing to collaborate with our customers to navigate this challenging environment and we remain optimistic about our growth for the year. It's worth noting that volume trends and Flavor Solutions typically fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, largely attributable to customer activity, including new product launches, limited time offers, and their other promotional activity. As we said at the CAGNY conference, McCormick is a growth company, and 2024 is an important investment year to return to our long-term objectives. Our results demonstrate the early impact of investments we have made to fuel our top-line and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. We have a robust set of initiatives and continue to expect share gains in units to lead our trends and our results will build throughout 2024. Let me share some of our perspectives on industry trends. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. Our shared insights give us a very strong understanding of consumers flavor needs, preferences, behaviors, and trends. Consumers remain challenged. Two years of steep inflation has had an impact and many are exhibiting value seeking behavior. While food inflation is slowing, its compounded impact is still being felt by consumers. Budgets are stretched, resulting in choiceful spending decisions, a trend that is continuing from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, with higher inflation in the food service channel and slowing retail food prices, we broadly saw a shift from food away-from-home to food-at-home consumption in our major markets. We are also seeing improvement in center store categories and some softness in restaurant traffic across all regions. As we said, the current state of the consumer is not defined by any one trend, it remains dynamic, and we are responding with speed and agility. I am encouraged by the early success of our key initiatives. We have the right plans in place that are continually influenced by what matters most to our consumers and customers, and fit within our strategic priorities. Moving to slide five, let me highlight for the quarter some of the key signposts of our success that demonstrate we have the right plans in place. Starting with spices and seasonings. In Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China, we grew volumes. In the U.S., our unit share performance continues to improve and we drove dollar share gains in Eastern Europe. In recipe mixes, we strengthened our performance with volume growth in the Americas, reversing the trends from the fourth quarter. Recipe mixes were a significant driver of U.K. volume growth and homemade desserts were also a substantial driver of France's volume growth. In both, we realized both unit and dollar market share gains. Volume growth in our Flavors business is strong across key categories, including outpacing the category in alcoholic beverages and performance nutrition. Finally, we grew volume in branded foodservice and realized market share gains in spices and seasonings and on Tabletop in hot sauces. Before I get into our growth plans, let me touch on some areas where there is some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like Frozen and Asian. In Americas Consumer, importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the improved volume trends in our core categories is beginning to offset these declines. For mustard in Americas Consumer, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to experience extremely low price points for private label, which is impacting our consumption and driving down category dollars. While performance in mustard improved relative to the fourth quarter, we still have work ahead of us. We plan to drive further volume improvement by narrowing price gaps and increasing promotions, new products, including Creamy Dill Pickle, and importantly through recent distribution wins. Moving to hot sauce, in Americas Consumer of consumption, volume trends improved from the fourth quarter, particularly coinciding with our successful Super Bowl activation campaign. Reflecting on our first quarter performance, it highlights two dynamics. First, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our growth plans remain consistent, fueling growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's RedHot brand marketing, with Frank's activated year-round for the first time, as well as exciting innovation aligned with consumer trends and expanding distribution. Second, recently we have seen a surge in $1 price point trial sizes from new and existing small players, which is incremental to the category and is pressuring our share performance. We remain the leader in this attractive, fragmented and growing category. New buyers present a great opportunity to win new households using our growth levers, as well as our scale and capabilities. In Flavors, our growth with Quick Serve Restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower QSR traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own business, in both Americas and EMEA. We are focused on working with our customers to support their innovation plans and continue to diversify our customer base over time. Before I talk through our growth plans in detail, let me touch on spices and seasonings. At a global level, we are pleased with the growth and consumption we delivered in the quarter. Specifically looking at U.S. spices and seasonings, we are driving significant improvements. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf, and we are recapturing distribution points, and our sequential improvement led to positive unit share gains at the end of the quarter. In addition, our growth is supported by our increased brand marketing and new products. Lastly, we expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results during the second half of the year, following most of our customers shelf resets at the end of the second quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on slide six, which are leading our strong first quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and beyond. Brand marketing, new products, and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies, and customer engagement continue to be the initiatives behind our growth levers. Starting with brand marketing, our plans across all categories are supported by our global brand marketing initiatives. We are prioritizing investments to connect with consumers and fuel growth. Our differentiated brand marketing is driven by a combination of factors. In addition to maintaining a high share of voice, we are committed to having the best content in our categories. Content that inspires and educates consumers and reaches them at the right points on their path to purchase and their flavor journey. From flavor exploration and menu planning, to shopping and cooking, and even to eating and sharing the experience online. In Q1, brand marketing spend was up significantly compared to the prior year as expected. This increase was broad-based across all regions and was an important driver in improving volumes. Through our efforts across multiple channels, particularly in retail media, we are driving further household penetration and increasing buy rates across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes, and condiments. Our holiday campaigns across our regions proved successful. Our marketing campaigns in the Americas highlight our everyday value and point-of-difference to consumers and are supporting our improved volume trends and share improvement. Our Frank Super Bowl activation campaign with Jason Kelce, now a retired NFL player, was very successful. We gained new buyers and media and consumer sentiment, as well as engagement from other big brands, was incredibly positive. We continue to benefit from new products and packaging. It is one of the primary drivers of our growth and as we said at CAGNY, the performance of our launches continues to improve. We are continuing to realize growth from our 2023 launches. For example, our Cholula sauces and recipe mixes are driving new buyers to the category and are exceeding our expectations since launch, and we continue to build U.S. distribution and are also launching both formats in Canada this year. The rollout of our U.S. Everyday Herbs & Spices portfolio is on plan and expected to be fully shifted by the end of the second quarter. Our Nadiya Hussain range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes continue to drive our innovation performance and expand household penetration with younger consumers. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, with our renovated recipe mixes, we have opportunities to win more dinner occasions with new global cuisine seasonings in both Americas and the AMEA and reshaping the portfolio by shifting offerings to meet consumers growing preference for non-red meat proteins. In Seasoning Blend, an exciting growth opportunity we mentioned at CAGNY, we are launching new Lawry's, seasoning blends in large sizes, which offer a value price point to consumers. And we are really excited about the Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format we just launched and are looking forward to another campaign featuring Jason Kelce. In Flavor Solutions, we are leveraging our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors, to win new customers, diversifying our customer base, and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our flavors customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. We are collaborating with many of our customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages. Our heat-brief win rates are strong across our regions. We continue to dedicate resources where we have the right to win. In Branded Food Service, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching a Cattlemen's Hawaiian Barbecue flavor, expanding our Seasonings portfolio with Ducros line extensions, and extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our consumer segment into this channel. Let's turn to category management, where I'd like to review our revenue management efforts and expanding distribution. First, revenue management remains a capability and we have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. We continue to take a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors. Our price investments are primarily focused in Americas consumer, where they impact about 15% of our portfolio in that segment. Revenue management will continue to be an important tool for driving growth, and we will consistently leverage real-time analytics and insights to refine our plans. In terms of expanding distribution, we continue to make progress on restoring a majority of the distribution that was lost due to supply issues. We have secured winds and new distribution. To further strengthen our value proposition in EMEA, we have grown distribution in the fast growing discount channel, and in the U.S., our Lawry's opening price point is expanding across the stores of a leading discounter. And in China, we are expanding in small format stores, which have grown rapidly in recent years, as well as into third and fourth-tier cities. We are meeting the consumer where they live and shop. Let me briefly mention our heat platform. As you heard in my remarks, heat-infused products span our portfolio and are driving growth. We expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for McCormick. Consumers, particularly younger generations, continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands and our meaningful scale and expertise that we have been building for decades. To wrap up, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories, and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. As we look ahead to 2024, we are maintaining our outlook. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we expect our top-line to be at the mid to high-end of our guidance range, given the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We are confident in our initiatives and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also continue to reflect on the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024. Before I pass the call to Mike, let me reiterate a few points. We are deliberately focused on attractive, high-growth categories across both segments, resulting in a significant long-term tailwind to drive profitable growth. That said, it is crucial that we continue to capitalize on this position of strength. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavorful exploration, and trusted brands continue to be very strong. And, importantly, consumer enjoyment in cooking is growing. We remain dedicated to improving volumes. We continue to refine our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. And, you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Now, over to Mike. Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on slide 23. First quarter results in our volume trajectory demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment to consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantage categories across segments. We are able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our GOE and CCI programs, to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the quarter, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving the mid-to-high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions and reiterate my confidence that together we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now, for your questions. Good morning, Andrew. Well, thanks Andrew for the question. Maybe just to open up with, a couple of remarks that I think drive at the heart of your question. We did have a strong quarter. We drove a little bit more on sales, which does give us confidence to be in that mid to upper half of our range. And I think importantly, we accomplished the things that we said we would do, and we made a lot of good progress. We drove sequential improvement, volume improvement in our core categories, especially on spices and seasonings. We said this would be a year of investment, and we were able to quickly execute the programs that we intended to get out in the market. That was an example of increased brand marketing, new product launches are performing well from 2023, and that targeted price gap management execution, and at the same time, we did expand margins. So we are pleased with the results, yet it is the start of the year, and it's our smallest quarter as you called out, and so we're keeping it in perspective. But this is strong progress, and so I think that gives us some of that confidence going into the rest of the year. As we noted on the call or probably as you expect, our pricing assumptions haven't changed. So this doesn't imply that volumes are improving as we go through the year. We have targeted investments, and we continue to expect to improve those volume trends as the year progresses and to drive volume growth during the second half of the year. We're focused on what we can control, and we're confident in those initiatives that we've called out, and hopefully you've heard the proof points that we've cited. We don't necessarily guide by quarter or segment or region, but we can provide some additional color in that. From the segment level, we'd expect those volumes to be relatively similar. We see that same volume growth in both segments in the second half, and as we did call out, the Flavor Solutions volume does fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, so that's something that we still expect to see across our business, largely attributed just to customer activity. But we do feel like there is a lot of good momentum, I think that we've established. The drivers of what's delivering this, we made substantial investments in the first half of the year on increased brand marketing. So it already happened in Q1. We expect to do some more of that in Q2. We also have new product launches coming out in 2024. For instance, we called out that flavor maker line that's going into bricks and mortar or we have a lot of Frank's innovation coming out in the marketplace as we lead into the grilling season, and we're really quite pleased with our category management and renovation across our portfolio. So I think that would speak to our confidence in the year as we continue to move forward. Let me give more context around Q1, and then that might also help provide sort of a foundation for how to think about the year to go. The volume decline of 2.6% in the Americas for Q1, it was really coming through two key factors. One is that DSD exit that we've spoken about quite a bit over the last four quarters. So that definitely was one of the drivers of that 2.6%, and then that decline in the prepared food categories as we noted on the call. So, if you exclude those two factors, volume growth in Consumer Americas would have been flat to slightly positive. So I think that's kind of a, helps to sort of set a foundation for how we think about the year to go. Also, in our key categories in Q1, growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes was pretty healthy. It was offset by declines in mustard and hot sauce. So, that's other context I think we would provide against Q1. As we look forward to the year, we expect volumes to continue to sequentially improve and drive volume growth as we get into the second half. So, that would probably be the best perspective I could provide on that. Sure. Sure. I'll make a couple of comments here, and Mike might have some things to add. We are not thinking about China any differently than what we said last quarter. It largely met our expectations for the first quarter, both from a consumer segment perspective and a flavor solution segment perspective. And we continue to expect that for total 2024, China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Broadly our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious. I mean, there are several reasons to continue to think that way, persisting unemployment with young adults, reduced consumer confidence. Consumers are still somewhat reluctant to spend. In our business, and that falls into our consumer segment, is sales to smaller independent restaurants and they are losing some traffic to the larger QSR chains. That might be where you're hearing us say two different things. So off of that is some perspective around that. Yet, like we do with other regions, we have plans in flight to address how we're looking at China and the changing trends of Chinese consumers. We do expect our Flavor Solutions business to be stronger in 2024, just based on the trends that we're seeing. So, that's I think, some of the perspective. Mike, do you want to add anything? Good morning. Thanks for the question, Max. Yeah, as a reminder, the proactive discontinuations over the course of the last two years make up roughly 50% of the TDP losses that we experienced. So just a reminder, as background on that and then of the TDP that we lost really due to supply, we've recovered really quite a bit of it, not entirely all of it, but a lot of it. I think the context, I would add on top of that in terms of what we're seeing right now, across our core categories, we're really making pretty good progress. So, for example, just on recipe mix, our total distribution points were up again in Q1 and at this point, we probably have the highest TDPs that we've seen in that category, probably compared to the last three or four years, and our share of TDPs is really quite healthy and strong. On hot sauce, again our TDPs were up in Q1, and we have the highest total TDP points on that business too, in the last three years. Mustard, similar situation, TDPs were up again in Q1, and we have the highest total TDPs and on that one, the share of TDPs in the last three years. So, a number of those categories, we feel like we're doing quite well and progressing quite nicely, up against this. In spices and seasonings, we're also making pretty good progress. In about five of our top six segments, we're seeing TDP growth. Broadly right now, TDP shares is flat for us, but we expect that to improve as we go through the year. A lot of these resets, when you think about any category or mostly that tend to happen in the middle of the year. We think towards the end of Q2, those will start to reflect on shelf. So I wouldn't say for all of Q2, but definitely as we go into the back half of the year, we think there'll be more full reflection of the gains that we think we've won. Good morning, Adam. Yeah, Adam I'm happy to provide more context on spices and seasonings. Just maybe speaking first to broadly what we saw in the industry, I think through the first quarter. As our prepared remarks noted, if you think about what appeared to be a very sort of challenging, difficult Q4, we started to see more center of store improvement compared to Q4 broadly, and maybe that came at the expense of food-away-from home to some degree. Certainly a cold winter always benefits McCormick. We like to see people make a lot of chili, and so that always is great for part of our recipe mixed business. But, what we're speaking specifically to spices and seasonings here. So, we tend to think about this from a different perspective. What's really driving I think our performance right now is, I would point out maybe a couple of things that are benefiting our business. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf and we're rolling out more of that. It's just pulling through and more of it will be complete by the end of the second quarter. So we're at 75% at the end of Q4. We believe that we're obviously somewhere between 75% and 100% at this point in time, and so that's driving improvement. We are recapturing distribution points too, and we think that sequential improvement led to some positive. That plus our increase in advertising and the velocity of our new \u2013 coming from our new packaging led to unit share gains at the end of the quarter. That increase in advertising, I think certainly was one of the things that we think led a lot of our positive trends in our business in spices and seasonings. So, these are some of the things that we've spoken to I think from not only the fourth quarter call but also at CAGNY and I would just reiterate them here. The collection or the integration of all of that together we believe is driving the right level of performance on the business overall. Thanks, Rob. So, let me address \u2013 I just want to make sure I don't forget your second question as I address yours. With regard to price gap management, I mean I think I just would go back to confirming what we've said also at CAGNY, is that that program and those efforts, which is quite targeted on a skew-by-skew basis, represents less than 15% of our Americas... And it's really being applied to targeted parts of our spices and seasonings category and recipe mixes. So, we're also taking price gap management efforts selectively across other regions. I would say EMEA is an example of that. But this is just part of, I think, good tactical blocking and tackling on the parts of our portfolio where we think maybe a price point just simply isn't at a place where it could be successful. So, that's the color I would add to that. Now, specifically on your question on hot sauce, the background I would first provide, hey, this is an attractive category. There's always, particularly more so than most categories, a lot of new competition always entering in the category. So, this is something that we live and operate with all the time. We do have underlying strength in our base business on hot sauce and really healthy consumer loyalty. Our plans remain pretty consistent. We're fueling a lot of growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's brand marketing. In fact, Frank's is going to be activated all 12 months of the year in terms of being on air, and that's the first time we're doing that. And to really tap into the growth that we've seen in this segment, and we are also expanding distribution. But our underlying trends are pretty good. Now, more recently, particularly in like the end of the fourth quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've seen retailers push the concept of trial sizes, like at $1 price point. And it's created, obviously, a lot of consumer value when you have just a really low opening price point of $1 for something that's like an ounce or less of product. But it's resulted in significant unit growth. It's been driving down sort of the category of volume and dollar growth that maybe we had been seeing, going into this time period. So that is pressuring our share performance, particularly on units, if you might imagine. A lot of this is driven by gifting during the holidays, and so you could see sort of the big spike, and then it's kind of decelerating since then. But, we still believe it's something that's contributing positively to the category because it's adding new users to the category. We've evaluated, how much of it's coming from new households versus existing households, and the majority of its coming from new households into the category. So that's always a positive. We're taking some of these learnings and looking at, our own efforts at having a trial size and competing in this kind of promotional area. Because we think it's obviously anything that drives trial and awareness in the category we think is healthy. And importantly, it's also building upon actions that we already have in place behind hot sauce, which is a lot of innovation coming out this year. I would say, particularly a lot on Frank's, but also Cholula. We're increasing the A&P support on all the brands. Where we have traditional promotional periods for these categories, we're just making sure they're at the right times during the year and on key use of education. Obviously, the summer certainly lends itself to that. Like think of the Mayo too, so that's the context on hot sauce. I think we're comfortable that we don't need to take any action. And we are, pretty precise, if I might say that in terms of how we apply this and where it best needs to be applied. But I also have to say, we're constantly evaluating this. So every month we're looking at data and results and deciding whether or not, something's in the right place. But, I think we have a lot of confidence that we're focusing on the right, percentage of the business. But, to speak more specifically, I think to just share perspective around that. While we don't guide to market share of a specificity, I think the trends in our business right now are going in the right direction, and in many ways delivering against what we would expect to see, which is, that focus on share improvement for us as we're looking at our business plans, first begins with improving unit growth. And then we expect dollar, to sort of follow on top of that. But, like in U.S. spices and seasonings we're seeing that type of performance right now. So just also appreciate, this is a big integrated effort with a lot of other activities, too, including increased brand marketing, innovation, price spec architecture, other category management efforts that we're putting forth. So, I wouldn't single out any one of those levers, but actually they all work together, and that's sort of the perspective I would add on top of your question. So, I'll speak first to mustard. We just, again, readdressed sort of the context and the background on this. We definitely are seeing sort of a lot of low price points in private label, fairly low, which impacted our consumption, and it's driving down the category dollars, but importantly, it's impacting, our trajectory on consumption. So, we do plan to improve those trends in 2024. Largely, I think we're going to look at increasing promotional programs. We have a big grilling season, quite excited, actually, about the grilling season coming up. Mustards a big part of that as are a number of items within our portfolio. That plus, just making sure we are at the right price points, I think, across that business. We're also strengthening distribution, too, which will strengthen trends on top of that. So, that's a perspective on mustard. It will continue to get better, but as we were talking about in the fourth quarter, I don't know that we saw \u2013 what we saw in the first quarter was, contrary to what we were expecting as we start to implement those plans, particularly as we get to the grilling season. On the prepared foods category that we spoke to, we're riding the trends right now in the marketplace, and I think that's what you would expect to see us \u2013 how we would see us perform. It's a smaller part of our portfolio. We would not kind of call it this part of that core, and so we are really, I think, just watching the trends, making sure we follow what's going on in the category, and we're treating it much like in that manner. Well, we do believe that when we gain in TDPs or distribution, we do that as incremental to our presence in the market at that time. I think speaking to its impact on the second quarter, we feel like we've got that called in our outlook for the rest of the year. So I don't know if there's anything specific I want to identify for the second quarter behind this, and when exactly all that stuff ships, etc. I think that's a level of detail we just probably wouldn't be getting into at this point. No, our McMex's [ph] joint venture had a great first quarter. I mean it's comping against a weaker first quarter too, so there's some of that in there. It's a little bit too early to call it the year. Just like here, there's the economy in Mexico. There's a lot of price volume things that are going through also as they've managed the year. So again, strong underlying business and we're really happy with it, but yes, we're hoping the rest of the year is just as strong as the first quarter, but it's a little bit too early to call on that one. I'm glad you asked that question, because we don't get a lot. I mean, it's such a large part of our portfolio. It gets ignored because it's below operating profit, but very profitable business. We have dominant \u2013 well, not dominant, but we have real strong brand positions down there across a couple of categories. And we export into the U.S., too, mayonnaise and other things too. So it's really, really good business for us. The fact that we didn't provide it means it's not really that material. We only \u2013 I think last year was the first year we provided it, but it was roughly equal for the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect a whole lot of change for the year."

            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide eight. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, reflecting 3% of pricing benefit, offset by a 1% volume and mix decline. As expected, volumes were impacted by our strategic decision to exit DSD, Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas. The exit of a private label product line, and the divestiture of a small canning business in EMEA. Underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, reflecting a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 3%. In our consumer segment, constant currency sales growth of 1% reflects a 3% increase in pricing actions, offset by a 2% volume decline, which is due to a 1% impact from the DSD business exit I just mentioned, lower volume and product mix in the Americas, specifically in Prepared Food Categories, including Frozen and Asian, consistent with our expectations, and the impact of the macro environment in China. On slide nine, consumer sales in the Americas were comparable to last year. Contribution from price was offset by a volume and mix decline of 3%. This decline was fully attributable to the DSD exit and lower volume and product mix in the Prepared Food Categories I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 8%, with a 5% increase in pricing actions and 3% volume growth. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were down 5%, driven by a 6% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we drove high single-digit sales growth with price and volume contributing equally, and the growth was broad-based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and slide 12, we grew first quarter constant currency sales by 2%, with pricing contributing 2% and volume contributing 1%, partially offset by a 1% decline due to the divestiture of the canning business and the exit of a private label product line in EMEA. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 3%, reflecting a 2% contribution from price and 1% growth in volume and product mix. Sales growth was led by Flavor, most notably in performance nutrition and branded food service. In EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 1%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business. Pricing actions of 4% were partially offset by lower volume and product mix of 2%, primarily attributable to the exit of the private label product line I mentioned earlier. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency, with a 4% contribution from pricing and 1% volume growth. Outside of China, sales remain negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts some of our quick service restaurant customers are experiencing in Southeast Asia. As seen on slide 16, gross profit margins expanded by 140 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix, the benefit of our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI, and our Global Operating Effectiveness Program or GOE, as well as effective price realization. As we look to the second quarter, we expect gross margins to modestly expand compared to the year ago period, as we realized our highest level of pricing and cost recovery in the second quarter of 2023. This trend may differ from our historical cadence, where gross margin increases sequentially every quarter throughout the year. However, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year. Now moving to slide 17, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the first quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing and research and development investments, which are partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points. Brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results, and we anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in an increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment was up 2%, with minimal impact from currency. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 15% and included a 1% currency impact. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, and in the first quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus the prior year in this segment. Our performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 18. Our interest expense was comparable to the prior year. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% compared to 21.8% in the year ago period. Our tax rate in the prior year benefited from discrete tax items. We expect these benefits to occur later in the year for us in 2024. As a result, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We're the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash-flow results. At the bottom line, as shown on slide 20, first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.59 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the results from McCormick de Mexico joint venture partially offset by higher adjusted effective tax rate. On slide 21, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in the first quarter $138 million compared to $103 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements. We returned $113 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on slide 22. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Given the momentum in the first quarter, we expect to be closer to the midpoint to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we continue to expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses. Through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize and we continue to expect to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic headwinds. Starting in the second quarter, we will have lapped the impact of the DSD and private label product line business exits. The divestiture of the Giotti canning business will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio. The impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. Finally in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility and demand in China, we continue to believe in a long-term growth trajectory of the China business. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low single-digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion, as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings, and we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in discrete impacts. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As we head into the second quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes. We expect a drive volume improvement, with some pressure expected in Flavor Solutions due to the trends Brendan mentioned earlier. Fully wrapped the impact of pricing actions we took in the prior year and activated a significant portion of our price cap management efforts, and continue our investments in brand marketing, as our programs are working and driving growth. As a result, our operating profit will likely be less robust for the second quarter. However, we continue to anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook. I think \u2013 to think about too, this is not just about Americas Consumer. I mean, we're building volume globally in the consumer side, and a lot of the same brand building activities, such as increased A&P, we talked about this in the call, is in all regions. So we continue to support those brands globally in each of our regions, not just Americas. Peter, thanks for your question on that. On an apples-to-apples basis, our consumption is roughly in line with our sales and we are shipping to consumption. What's probably driving the U.S. consumption, lagging on Americas consumer sales is we had good growth in Latin America and Canada and that contributed to our total growth. But we also delivered growth in unmeasured, excluding that DSD business exit that we talked about. So we do expect and continue the alignment between consumption and shipments moving forward. We don't really believe that there's any sort of inventory movement that we can call out at this point in time. But it's also important to call out that in that unmeasured growth was primarily driven by e-commerce. It represents this globally for us, about 10% of our total consumer sales, and so that's pretty healthy and positive. But we've seen double digit growth in all of 2023 in e-commerce and did again in Q1. So we continue to believe that e-commerce is a growth channel, and we do continue to put resources up against it. But coming back to sort of the top of your question on the influences on measured channels, I would probably think about that as one thing to consider and think about. But largely, we really believe that our shipments and consumption are broadly in line with. Yeah, I think, we were in China about two months ago and saw a lot of these trends with QSRs, big established QSRs were starting to gain share and drive some traffic into their stores versus that kind of smaller mom and pop type stores. I mean, I would just give you context to this kind of talk as we talk about our whole Flavor Solutions business. The QSR business in some parts of the world, like China, is really doing well. Other parts, it's a bit challenged. So as you think about our guidance, those are things that you can talk about the Flavor Solutions business is lumpy in part due to the fact that, our CPG customers and QSR customers control new product launches and there's foot traffic and things like that. But China has started off strong on the QSR side, which is great. Yeah, this is Mike. I think you're right. We're really happy with the first quarter performance there, the sequential improvement. But, some of our regions, the QSR business is pretty material, such as the EMEA. It's very public, some of the customers coming out talking about the food traffic. So, I think as Brendan said in the call, the second quarter, there is a bit of headwind there on the Flavor Solutions side, so I wouldn't be surprised by that. But, as Brendan said, too, the second half, both for Consumer and Flavor Solutions volume, we're expecting strength. I think about our performance, too, in halves versus quarters, because quarters can get very weak. That makes a difference sometimes. So, within the first half, we're still calling for kind of flattish volume, second half volume growth across the business. So, think about it in those terms, too. I think, Adam, maybe think about it this way. I mean, second quarter is kind of an inflection point for us. The pricing which for the first quarter was about 2.7% and think about it for the year is going to be at 1%. So, second, third, and fourth quarters is coming down. While volume is turning positive and we're getting sequentially improvements, in that second quarter you don't have as much cover for pricing and your volume while it's improving isn't to the level it is in the second half. So that is \u2013 in second quarter, as I said in the remarks, we're activating some of our price cap management activities more than in the first quarter. So that puts a little pressure on the sales line and the profit line. But we're confident those investments, including increased A&P, which we had in the first quarter but also in the second quarter too, will contribute to driving sequential volume improvement in both Q2 but in the second half. So, I think what you're getting a little bit is a bit of a \u2013 like I said, it's an inflection point before the volume growth, which we'll talk about in the second half. So, it puts a little pressure on margins. We're still having positive margin improvement versus last year, but if you think about last year, that was like the sweet spot of when our pricings were really going in, overcoming the cost impacts. We talked about that last second quarter. So that was \u2013 at that point our margins were up 300 basis points from the prior year, I think it was. But we still see, again back to the first half, second half really good margin improvement in the second half for the first half. The first half is about investments. We benefited in the first quarter also, the wrap GOE programs, things like that too, which did help the first quarter, but a lot of moving parts in the second. That's why we tried to give you a little bit of summary in the script. Yeah, 15%, its 15 not 50. Hey, Matt. Let me kick off here, and then Mike [inaudible]. I think as you think about that 15%, again, I would stress 15, not 50, is that is a total look at the year. So, indeed, I would say our Q1 isn't necessarily at that level yet, and we would expect to start to hit that type of percentage of our business as we go through the year. So, just quickly off the top, I wanted to help provide some of that context around your question, Mike. No, and Matt, good question. And just as I said in the script, the second quarter is a bit of pressure because it does more activation in the second quarter. So, you're right, a little bit in the fourth, more in the first. Second quarter is when it's really almost fully activated quite nicely so. But, again, these are investments that drive that volume growth building throughout the year, which we \u2013 the early results of the fourth and first quarter investments have been very positive, combined with the A&P and things like Brendan just mentioned, so that holistic program. Yeah, I think about it, too. You think about \u2013 we've talked about our portfolio management and this is part of that. We're making sure that items we have in our portfolio, just whether on the consumer or Flavor Solution side, we can improve business that doesn't meet our target, so you'll see some of that probably in this area too, but we won't be calling it out as a separate item. I think, Thomas, maybe as your saying, I think you are kind of focusing on the shelf renovation with the new bottles. That's been rolling out from the end of last year into this year, and that's really not a big shipment, that's what we're replacing. It's kind of going \u2013 it's not a big reset. It's the same size bottle basically. It fits on a roll bin, so we're just kind of filling the pipeline with that. So you're not going to see a big spike. Now, you will see better velocity and things like that, which is why we did it, and that will build throughout the year. Some of the resets we talked about with winning new business on other categories, those shelf sets happen sometime in the second quarter and will benefit us in the second half. So there's kind of two different thoughts there as you think about it. And welcome to the call. It's your first call with us, Thomas. Well, Rob, I think there's possibly two different questions there. I'll make an attempt at what I think you are getting at, which is what we're seeing in our business, and we read our business through Circana, and that's a much broader, more refined view of our categories, and so we are reflecting that kind of data in our performance as we talk about it. Compared to what Nielsen might be reporting, I think traditionally over time we've seen differences in that reporting. We don't really reconcile that on the call or do anything of that nature, but there have been at times a difference in what Nielsen might be reporting in terms of how they are capturing the category versus the more refined, higher level, broader view as we look at spices and seasonings in our category. So that might address part of your question. Now, the other half of that could be, it's about unmeasured channels, etc., and I would go back to the comments that I made earlier that we largely see everything pretty much being in line between shipments and consumption. We are getting a lot of strong growth in e-commerce, as I called out earlier in the call. So that certainly is something that could create a difference in the numbers and the metrics, and obviously good performance in Canada and Latin America. I'm going to pause to see if maybe we thoughtfully addressed, I think."
