At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you are all safe and sound. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren, and good morning from New York. It certainly feels like a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Mastercard\u2019s CEO. I believe the foundation established under Ajay\u2019s leadership positions us extremely well for the future. And I\u2019m looking forward to leading Mastercard from here on, and of course, counting on your continued support. Now, 2020 presented the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement. As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we\u2019re well-positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas, while overall Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter. Now, we\u2019re also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders opened, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we\u2019re working closely with governments to get funds into people\u2019s hands quickly and safely. Now, turning to our business specifically and the four-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment, see markets go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth. Looking at the trends. Volumes continued to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic. Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October and November, we saw some improvement in cross-border within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited. Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you. Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we\u2019ve had in debit with Santander and first direct, we\u2019re really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent wins [ph] that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build an enhanced digital experience for NatWest\u2019s customers across multiple payment rails. Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postbank Banks, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership and will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers\u2019 consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows. In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers with a seamless and more secure payment experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that\u2019s automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online. Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like Payoneer and Aeldra in the U.S., HYPE and Flow in Italy, Treezor in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers appreciate our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and of course, our global network. Now we\u2019re also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multifaceted relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Synchrony Bank and prepaid products that enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage a number of Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments. We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future of health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam\u2019s Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday, and extended our Walmart consumer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s to include small business. Let\u2019s come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year. In both the UK and Spain, we\u2019re innovating with IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios points and reward them with exclusive benefits. And on the wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers. Let\u2019s talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates, with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 40% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a six-fold increase in the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter four versus a year ago. Now, recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumers have a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file tokenization is particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix, marketplaces like Etsy and ride-hailing services like DiDi who have just signed on this quarter. But we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person. And hence, we\u2019re driving a secular shift in store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, cleanliness at the point of checkout. This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic. Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment flows to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse. Our recent acquisitions in the services space providing a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded its use of Ethoca\u2019s dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company Rappi, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and Transfast [ph] certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like Chico\u2019s are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through SessionM. So let\u2019s turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect. First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Brex, BMO Harris, Charles Schwab and ED Bank, [ph] and we\u2019re moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships. Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well. In the real-time space, we\u2019re excited that Payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada\u2019s economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 GDP countries, extending our global footprint. Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, which is now live with real-time payments and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionalities. We\u2019ve also extended Track\u2019s card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities. We\u2019re also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with TransferGo, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card. Now let\u2019s take a look into the future. As you\u2019ve surely heard, there\u2019s a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating central bank digital currencies. When a country chooses to issue its own CBDC like the pilots we\u2019ve seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to central banks through our policy and the solution perspective. We\u2019ve continued to invest in this space to be ready to co-invest with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wirex in the U.K. and Uphold in the U.S., enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network. This year, we plan on adding digital currency controlled directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. This will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive. Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there\u2019s certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company\u2019s equity investments. Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021. So let\u2019s turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with debt growth of 15%, partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat. Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our data analytics, consulting and cyber and intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%. Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expense decrease of 3 ppt. Turning to Page 8, let\u2019s discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes, we continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December. While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy. When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border. Turning now to Page 9. I\u2019d like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned. Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we effectively received strong growth across discretionary and nondiscretionary retail categories. Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including those with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few. Further, we have positioned ourselves with the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate than before, and we will deepen penetration of these services across our customer base while expanding this portfolio. And our multi-rail strategy positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing payments landscape. In terms of the macro environment, we\u2019re enthusiastic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the rate at which vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further relaxation of social distancing measures and improvement in consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during this quarter. In addition, I will offer a few additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower cross-border related deals until broader scale interregional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic primarily in March. Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap year and so Q1 2020 had an extra day of volumes and revenues. And finally, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be flat or up slightly sequentially due to new deal activity, including some of the recent wins Michael has just discussed. Now let\u2019s turn to operating expenses. We continue to carefully manage our properties in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, namely digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping of spending actions taken a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, Finicity closed near the end of last November, and we continue to expect the transaction with Nets to close in Q1. Based on this timing, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about a 0.5 ppt to revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year. After which, we do not split them up. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q1. On the other income and expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Sachin. Tanya, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nWarren Kneeshaw: Tanya, it\u2019s coming through very rough at this end. So, if you can try to correct that. First question, please?\nOperator: Your first question [Technical Difficulty] with JP Morgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Technical Difficulty]\nWarren Kneeshaw: There\u2019s a lot of static on the line. [Technical Difficulty] \nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research.\nCraig Maurer: [Technical Difficulty]\nWarren Kneeshaw: [Technical Difficulty]\nCraig Maurer: [Technical Difficulty] I wanted to ask about [Technical Difficulty] some of the announcements [Technical Difficulty] any improvement [Technical Difficulty]?\nWarren Kneeshaw: Craig, you just dropped off. Can you still hear us? I\u2019ll just rephrase the question in the hopes that you\u2019re still on. [Technical Difficulty].\nMichael Miebach: So, Craig, I can take that question. I just want to make sure you\u2019re still around. Craig, can you hear us?\nCraig Maurer: [Technical Difficulty]\nMichael Miebach: Okay. We\u2019re working on it. Yes, we\u2019re just working on it. Let me try and take that so I can \u2013 [Technical Difficulty] a question on what the impact of the [Technical Difficulty] A couple of things [Technical Difficulty]. There is no change in our pricing either. Specifically on your question on payment [Technical Difficulty] once the transaction ended on the 31st of December of last year, the UK effectively became subject to the same interchange [Technical Difficulty] any other non-EU countries as agreed with the European Commission. And recognizing the prevailing pandemic, what we did is we set the timing of the change we commenced in October of 2021. We are very aware of the challenges which are being faced by retailers, businesses and people [Technical Difficulty] this pandemic. And we continue to view the timing of the implementation of this position as we go forward -- look forward for this year.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take the next question with [Technical Difficulty] with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you hear me?\nMichael Miebach: Yes, I can hear you.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Technical Difficulty]\nWarren Kneeshaw: Yes. I\u2019m sorry. We couldn\u2019t get that. Just hold on a sec. We\u2019re just trying to switch over the lines. This is Warren. There\u2019s a problem with the operator\u2019s line. AT&T is working it. We are just going to pause for a moment. So, if you could just bear with us. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Glad you\u2019re back. I wanted to ask about the impact of stimulus on your volumes. Is the U.S. switched volume improvement in January versus December, is this -- do you attribute this largely to the impact of stimulus? And then secondarily, I was interested, Michael, on what you were saying about Mastercard\u2019s participation with the central bank digital coins and how you\u2019re going to enable them to flow on your network. How do you help governments with that product? What can Mastercard do there to be of utility?\nSachin Mehra: Ramsey, it\u2019s Sachin. I\u2019ll take the first question. So, to your question, what we are seeing in the first three weeks of January is better performance in the U.S., and we are attributing that primarily to the impact of stimulus. Obviously, there\u2019s several factors which go into overall spending trends, but this definitely does play a part. And we are seeing that come through. In terms of spend levels in the U.S. in the first 3 weeks as well as from a mixed standpoint, what we\u2019re seeing as being more weighted to a debit in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S.\nMichael Miebach: Good. And on the central bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so here\u2019s multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country. So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and then we will certainly partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure. But let\u2019s come back to CBDCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I\u2019m happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there\u2019s different roles between a central bank and a private sector bank. You don\u2019t -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth, so a 2-tier approach. And our partnership is with both sectors in this case. Private sector to say what utility could be brought? What\u2019s the functionality that makes a difference, let\u2019s say, when you want to pay with a cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have that links the cryptocurrency that\u2019s trading on our network is a very tangible example of what we could do. Then you think about other aspects here is that it\u2019s generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And if you could imagine a world where there\u2019s a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government-issued CBDC, and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying set of rails which we participate in and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector. That\u2019s the play. Early stages, but we will support. And we today only carry CF currency in our network. And when this makes its way, then we\u2019ll carry CBDCs in our network.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: I just want to ask on the NatWest win on the debit side. That\u2019s a nice one. Anything interesting to share on how this win came together? And I\u2019m also just curious, bigger picture of the pipeline for new deals, if it\u2019s changed at all, if it\u2019s different in terms of size and quality now versus, say, this time last year, pre-COVID.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. So let me take the first part of the question and then Sachin can talk a little bit more about the pipeline and so forth. Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank, if I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We\u2019re going to want to co-innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real. Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is -- open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it\u2019s an additional capability that\u2019s a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe. So I would summarize it, Tien-tsin, as innovation. Certainly, pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution selling approach brings it all together across services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business. So I think that\u2019s generally the story. And how that\u2019s changing to, let\u2019s say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we\u2019re growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we\u2019re just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. And Tien-tsin, I\u2019ll just add. Michael touched upon the point around the power of the services capabilities that we bring. And you\u2019ve heard this over the last, I don\u2019t know how many quarters. The wins we\u2019re having are very much supported by the strength of our services capabilities. It makes a real difference when we can walk in and talk with customers about how we can help them grow their top line and manage their expense base as it relates to fraud and things like that, which become more of a partnership discussion than a vendor relationship. And that\u2019s been a key enabler as to helping us win. And that carries on, whether it\u2019s NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the whole kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust. I mean things are going to keep happening. We\u2019re going to renew existing customers. We\u2019re going to keep working on new customers. We\u2019re going to look to expand portfolios with existing customers. So that\u2019s very much upfront and center in the bucket of what I call controllables. So there\u2019s stuff which is happening in the macro environment, which we don\u2019t necessarily control. But there are things we do, which is engagement with our customers and we\u2019re driving hard on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: A quick question on debit. You mentioned debit is driving most of the growth. And if I look at Q4 versus Q3 debit growth in the U.S., it did decelerate by about 200 basis points. I just want to know what\u2019s behind it. I see the comps are a little easier. So it would be great to get a bit of an explanation of what drove that in the fourth quarter and how is it looking in the first quarter.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So again, you should think about the mix between debit and credit are based on a couple of things. One, what\u2019s going on globally in the nature of the release of stimulus payments? What the timing of that is and what\u2019s the timing of associated spend on that stimulus payment. That\u2019s kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit. So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It\u2019s largely been driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus we\u2019ve referred in Q3 started to weigh in Q4. On the flip side, credit performed really, really well. And when I say really well, it was still in negative, but a market improvement in credit because there was a greater spend taking place in discretionary categories, which are credit heavy. So we follow this and we track this pretty closely. And I think that would be the reasons why you should explain what changes are taking place in terms of the mix between debit and credit.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. And just one point to add then. What we\u2019ve seen in previous challenged periods in terms of economic outlook, there is -- in a downturn, debit is all generally preferred. And the main reason for that is people really want to spend the money that they have and avoid taking on extra burden in terms of additional debt. So this is a normal pattern that we have seen and it plays out in a way that Sachin just talked about.\nDan Dolev: Congrats on your first call.\nMichael Miebach: Well, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: I just wanted to ask a 2-part question on cross-border. The first part is -- the highest yielding part of the cross-border business, the non-intra-Europe piece recently seems like the year-over-year declined or moderating a little bit. I don\u2019t want to make too much out of a couple of weeks of data. But can you just touch on what has maybe driven the incremental improvement in that metric and the sustainability of the improvement as the comps presumably get progressively easier from here, more or less on a weekly basis? And then just the second part is more of a conceptual question. I mean in your base case of macro recovery and travel recovery, is it feasible that cross-border revenues next year in 2022 could get back to 2019 level? Not obviously asking for guidance but conceptually based on how you think the macro could theoretically unfold.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, Jason. On the first part of your question, here\u2019s what I\u2019d tell you. I would tell you, we\u2019re closely watching what these trends are. In the first 3 weeks, we have exactly what you\u2019re saying, which is the non-intra-Europe cross-border had started to see a little bit of a recovery come through. There are lots of puts and takes which take place there. And let me try and give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right? First, at the end of the day, when you think about this component of non-intra cross-border, there are still several borders which are open. There are people traveling, if you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East and Africa. I could think about certain travel which is taking place in Asia Pacific. So you might be seeing -- you\u2019re seeing a little bit of that come through. The other component which is driving this is, at the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes and traveling. But other cross-border is also influenced by expats, people who are sitting in far locations, who have cars, which are -- from their home countries. And the spend patterns on that could be influencing a little bit of what were going on -- what we\u2019re seeing here. I wouldn\u2019t make too much of the trend we are seeing in the first 3 weeks. We have to watch it for a little bit of a longer period of time. And that\u2019s the kind of color I could share with you on that. On your longer-term question on cross-border, look, I got to tell you, we as a company are very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still kind of uncertain, and we\u2019ll watch how the rollout goes. We believe -- with the availability of vaccines at scale, we believe of the availability of more efficient testing therapeutics. People -- the consumer -- the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. And social distancing measures would start to relax. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So [indiscernible] I would tell you, I\u2019m quite optimistic about the fact that we\u2019re seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results would suggest. And we\u2019ll see where it all kind of shakes out. I\u2019m really not in a position to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just stand back and thought about it, the near term and in the longer term, the nearer term will continue to be linear until the vaccine stuff is rolled out at scale. The longer term, we feel very encouraged about.\nMichael Miebach: Just an aspect to add here. And that is that there\u2019s distinction between personal travel and corporate travel. We\u2019ve seen it in the summer, this past summer 2020. The reaction, once consumer confidence increases, turned right up into travel increasing because people want to get on with their lives. They want to see their friends, their families and whatever. So the reaction of personal travel, too, driven by consumer confidence, which will in turn be driven by the vaccine rollout Sachin just talked about, I think, was going to be relatively near term. Corporate travel, that will take longer. Video tools, we should have actually used the video tool today maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, we don\u2019t exactly know. But back to personal travel, that is a significant majority of our travel portfolio. And all the wins that we had recently, they\u2019re going to kick at this time. So medium term, we\u2019re encouraged.\nOperator: Your next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Just a very quick follow-up on cross-border and then a structural question. But on cross-border, we remember, in February and March, it really started in Europe and the slowdown and then in March, obviously, the U.S. And so I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s where the comps you expect to start seeing it ease up. But Michael, more from a structural standpoint, I just want to understand, I mean, what do you -- now that it\u2019s almost been a year, when we look at services and the opportunity there, when you look at some of the other opportunities around contactless and e-comm, can you just touch on what you expect to be more permanent or more sustainable in terms of the business improvements due to the electronic nature of what we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. So Darrin, it\u2019s Sachin. On your question around the lapping effect of cross-border, you\u2019re right. We saw some cross-border decline start in the later part of February is what I would tell you. But the vast majority of the lapping effect, like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see across all our drivers in the month of March. That\u2019s the way I kind of think about what we\u2019re seeing here.\nMichael Miebach: All right. And Darrin, on the questions on the trends, what makes the trends? That\u2019s like -- that\u2019s the key question here. Certainly, we started a digitization trend that\u2019s been around for years, accelerate dramatically. I think it\u2019s fair to say that years have been compressed into months. So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we\u2019re going to see as structural changes, as sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before. The surveys that we\u2019ve done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers -- broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now, and we don\u2019t think that will change. 70% of consumers, they\u2019re going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain. As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience, as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we\u2019ll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We\u2019ll benefit from both of them. Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that\u2019s an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective. And then there\u2019s a whole cross-border [indiscernible] digitizing supply chains, B2B. I would say that\u2019s the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: And Michael, congrats again. In the prepared remarks, you highlighted the addition of Finicity to Mastercard\u2019s open banking portfolio. Can you elaborate a bit on how you\u2019re thinking about open banking where a payment or funds transfer could be made with debit, with Mastercard Send, with Fast ACH or RTP? Can you just comment a bit on how Mastercard\u2019s role differs, value-added differs, economics differ across all of these different methods of payment? And are you agnostic or not? Why? Why not?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. That\u2019s a pretty broad question, Lisa. So let me tick the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business all behind that. Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is, it\u2019s adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning. So it\u2019s a wide range of use cases, and we\u2019re pretty agnostic what they are. We\u2019re quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively. That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That\u2019s check, check, check, and it\u2019s a good combination for us. Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay through cards, whatever it is, one thing is through Mastercard. That\u2019s the overall strategy. Finicity helps us clearly in the United States. But as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time. Taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter. Now Sachin can help you unravel some of these business models behind that.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. So Lisa, just a couple of thoughts around that. I think you\u2019re quite familiar with the way we think about what constitutes our yield as a business, right? It\u2019s across infrastructure, applications and services. And I would tell you whether it\u2019s our card rails or it\u2019s our real-time ACH rails or it\u2019s open banking. The reality is there\u2019s an opportunity to realize revenue across all of these 3 layers: infrastructure, apps and services. And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails, well, the reality is we\u2019re in the business of providing choice to consumers. And what we\u2019re going to do is provide choice, we\u2019re getting price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it\u2019s a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over -- for example, open bank rails maybe, but it\u2019s a payment transaction. What I can tell you, though, is take something like Pay by Account, which we\u2019ve launched in the U.K. The economics for us on Pay by Account in the consumer use case in the U.K. are quite similar to our economics out there.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. But broadly speaking, I think fair to say we are agnostic. It\u2019s about choice. If the market want to go the one way, then the market will go one way and we\u2019ll partner it. And otherwise, it goes a different way, we\u2019ll partner it.\nWarren Kneeshaw: We\u2019re going to go to about 10 after 10:00, if you can stick with us just to take a few more questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: So one area of focus for investors has been what the makeup of cross-border volumes will start to look like over the next 3 to 5 years. So clearly, in 2020, retail e-commerce became a much larger piece of the mix. Travel became a smaller piece of the mix. But longer term, once we assume a travel recovery -- but there will also be the mix in Mastercard Send, Transfast, Mastercard Track expanding into B2B, more account-to-account remittances, et cetera, across the board mixing into the cross-border volumes. Maybe you can talk about that evolution over the next few years and what that mix might look like.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. Tim, it\u2019s Sachin. So a couple of thoughts. One, we do expect, with the return of travel, the mix will start to come back to a certain level similar to what we saw pre-COVID. It might take a little of time as it relates to the business travel component. But I want to remind you that the vast majority of our travel from a cross-border perspective happens to be personal travel, which we expect to come back and come back based on the comment which Michael made around the pent-up demand. So we\u2019ll see that come through. But you\u2019re exactly right about other elements of cross-border, whether it\u2019s leveraging our real-time rails and the applications in our cross-border manner, real opportunity we feel that as well because today, what we\u2019re tapping into is the consumer flows, what we call the person-to-merchant flows, leveraging our card rails in a cross-border environment. The opportunity from a B2B standpoint still remains largely untapped. And this is where our suite of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it\u2019s our Send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we\u2019re rolling those out pretty nicely. We\u2019re building scale, we\u2019re building capabilities as we go down that path. So all in all, I tell you, cross-border remains a selling -- decent sized opportunity on a going-forward basis.\nMichael Miebach: And Tim, back to my earlier comments around structural changes, B2B and supply chain. A big part of the supply chain insight that people have just gained over the last 9 months is that there\u2019s dependency on parts of the supply chain cross-border that they want to digitize and this -- so they can be more flexible to change suppliers in future scenarios. Now here, we come in with Transfast. We come in with our announced acquisition of HomeSend, the combination of all of that. And then you take this multi-rail capabilities, picture this in the context of Track, where there\u2019s a data switch, all the data that you want alongside with your B2B transaction is coming along and you choose whichever way you want to send it. Use case of like remittances by our supplier payments, which make up about $110 trillion of global flows. Significant opportunities for us, we got the assets in place.\nOperator: Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: So Michael, congratulations as well. I did get your updated thoughts on like big tech. Clearly, fintech proliferation is a big positive for the networks in our view. But how are the discussions with the big tech players going today versus a year or 2 ago? And do you think your interests are still aligned commercially and also in Washington from a regulatory perspective?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Don, that\u2019s a good question to round this call off, I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of elements that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives. The first is our focus, just want to run you was, these are partners, these are customers, and we have strong relationships with all of them. Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it. And just think about the Apple Card as an example there. When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails, in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there\u2019s a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem and here\u2019s big tech players. But what I\u2019m finding is that our specialist role here and our focus specific on payment technology makes us a very relevant partner. Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience to their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they\u2019re a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of interaction that I think will continue to evolve. Some of these players do have payment aspirations. And Don, that\u2019s where your question is going. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like card-on-file tokenization and so forth. We help them with our services portfolio while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience. The xPays is a good example for that. And as long as there\u2019s choice and underlying payment tools, we\u2019re quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of the digital trend. In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and the view on big tech, that is for them to comment on. Basically, we\u2019re guided by our partnership. We\u2019re going to lean in and continue to drive our business. Overall, otherwise, it\u2019s early days. We have a great dialogue with the incoming administration. They\u2019re interested in payments which we generally like. This is, by the way, the trend around the world. Governments interested in payments is critical national infrastructure, and we engage in that dialogue, topics of cybersecurity and data principles where we\u2019re all a leading voice and that\u2019s how we engage.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Michael. I think it\u2019s time to wrap up. I just wanted to thank you for bearing with us as we went through this process. And I\u2019m sure Michael will always remember his first call as CEO, but unfortunately, [indiscernible] kind of statement. Michael, any final thoughts?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. My blood pressure is slowly coming down again after this little hump earlier. No, thank you for the questions. Really appreciate the interest and the dialogue. Don\u2019t want to repeat anything. Just -- I have to go back one more time to 2020. That was a challenging year for the industry. That was certainly something that made us -- needed us to be as agile as we could possibly be. And I just want to comment again that our employees really stepped up and allowed us to close out the year on this positive trajectory. Now we said on a number of occasions throughout this call here, we\u2019re optimistic about COVID recovery, really in the light of the vaccine being deployed. We\u2019re optimistic about cross-border coming back driven by the exact same point. So in the near term, there\u2019s optimism. In the very, very long term, there is optimism. I want to make one more point. All of this is great from an economic perspective and a performance perspective. What is equally important is that we do the right thing for communities and for our planet. And this week, I\u2019m really proud and so many people at Mastercard are as we put out our net zero commitment. And that is just the last thought I want to leave you with that. With that, looking forward to speaking to you with less technical issues in a quarter from now. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain litigation and tax matters and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was down 7%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year or down 3% if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 12% and net income was down 17%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 16% year-over-year to $1.64, which includes $0.04 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $356 million through January 26, 2021. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4%, with debt growth of 15%, partially offset by a credit decline of 7%. Outside of the U.S., volumes were flat. Cross-border volume was down 29% globally for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, intra-Europe volumes were less impacted than other cross-border volumes. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 15% for the quarter, whereas other cross-border volume was down 41%. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 4% in the fourth quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.8 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 7% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV, switched transactions and continued growth in our services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 1%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 41%, while cross-border volumes decreased 29%. The 12 ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross-border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switched transactions were up 4%, with the unfavorable cross-border mix I just mentioned being offset by strong services growth. Other revenues were up 17%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our data analytics, consulting and cyber and intelligence solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 1%. Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding a special charge related to litigation, total operating expenses remained flat. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered an expense decrease of 3 ppt. Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of January. Starting with switched volumes, we continue to believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. Overall, switched volume growth remains generally consistent with the trends we saw in December. While we are seeing stronger growth in the U.S., this is being more than offset by slower growth in markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe. Switched volumes in the United States have been strong in recent weeks, supported in part due to the recent fiscal stimulus. Outside of the U.S., switched volumes in Europe have slowed considerably due to the increased lockdowns in countries like the U.K., Germany and Italy. When you look at how people are spending, we have recently seen a decrease in card-present growth rate due primarily to the effects of the increased lockdowns that began to be put in place in December, while our card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are tracking the trends we are seeing at switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, we have seen a reversal in intra-Europe cross-border in recent weeks relative to the improvement we saw in November and December. Higher-yielding other cross-border remains more adversely impacted than intra-Europe cross-border. Turning now to Page 9. I'd like to provide some additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we shared through the course of the quarter continue. Week-to-week fluctuations in November and December reflect holiday timing differences year-over-year. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border, which showed some improvement in November and December, is now continuing in a relatively similar band to what we saw in October due to the reimplementation of border restrictions. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend reflects continued limited travel, in part due to the border restrictions I just mentioned. Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present spend, excluding online travel-related spend, and remains positive as we effectively received strong growth across discretionary and nondiscretionary retail categories. Turning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the upcoming year. First and foremost, we feel like we are very well positioned to grow with the strategic deals we have laid out over the last several quarters, including those with Bank of America, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Santander, to name a few. Further, we have positioned ourselves with the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. We have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a faster rate than before, and we will deepen penetration of these services across our customer base while expanding this portfolio. And our multi-rail strategy positions us well to address new flows and adapt to the changing payments landscape. In terms of the macro environment, we're enthusiastic about the availability of effective vaccines. However, the rate at which vaccinations will take place is still uncertain. As a result, we will not be providing a forward view on net revenue for 2021 at this time as we believe visibility is dependent upon border opening, the further relaxation of social distancing measures and improvement in consumer confidence. As we have said, we expect to see progress in these areas in the second half of 2021. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate that some of the more restrictive measures that have recently been put in place because of rising infections will persist in the near term. If this were to be the case, we would not expect spending levels to improve from what we have seen so far in January. By the way, we do plan on providing periodic updates to the operating metrics during this quarter. In addition, I will offer a few additional points to help you with your modeling. First, we will continue to experience lower cross-border related deals until broader scale interregional travel recovers. Second, from a growth rate perspective, we expect to start lapping the effects of the pandemic primarily in March. Also, as a reminder, last year was a leap year and so Q1 2020 had an extra day of volumes and revenues. And finally, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be flat or up slightly sequentially due to new deal activity, including some of the recent wins Michael has just discussed. Now let's turn to operating expenses. We continue to carefully manage our properties in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, namely digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q1, we expect operating expense growth to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Of note, this increase reflects the lapping of spending actions taken a year ago as a result of the pandemic as well as a 3 ppt increase due to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. With respect to acquisitions made in 2020 or later, Finicity closed near the end of last November, and we continue to expect the transaction with Nets to close in Q1. Based on this timing, we expect the acquisitions to contribute about a 0.5 ppt to revenue in Q1 and 1 to 2 ppt for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses growth in the first quarter and 7 to 8 ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discreetly disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they closed and the subsequent year. After which, we do not split them up. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 2 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q1. On the other income and expense line, we had an expense run rate of approximately $110 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses in our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on our current geographic mix of the business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Ramsey, it's Sachin. I'll take the first question. So, to your question, what we are seeing in the first three weeks of January is better performance in the U.S., and we are attributing that primarily to the impact of stimulus. Obviously, there's several factors which go into overall spending trends, but this definitely does play a part. And we are seeing that come through. In terms of spend levels in the U.S. in the first 3 weeks as well as from a mixed standpoint, what we're seeing as being more weighted to a debit in terms of what we're seeing in the U.S. Yes. And Tien-tsin, I'll just add. Michael touched upon the point around the power of the services capabilities that we bring. And you've heard this over the last, I don't know how many quarters. The wins we're having are very much supported by the strength of our services capabilities. It makes a real difference when we can walk in and talk with customers about how we can help them grow their top line and manage their expense base as it relates to fraud and things like that, which become more of a partnership discussion than a vendor relationship. And that's been a key enabler as to helping us win. And that carries on, whether it's NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the whole kind of spectrum of deals. And what do I expect on a going-forward basis? The pipeline remains robust. I mean things are going to keep happening. We're going to renew existing customers. We're going to keep working on new customers. We're going to look to expand portfolios with existing customers. So that's very much upfront and center in the bucket of what I call controllables. So there's stuff which is happening in the macro environment, which we don't necessarily control. But there are things we do, which is engagement with our customers and we're driving hard on that. Sure. So again, you should think about the mix between debit and credit are based on a couple of things. One, what's going on globally in the nature of the release of stimulus payments? What the timing of that is and what's the timing of associated spend on that stimulus payment. That's kind of bucket number one. Bucket number two is, what are the categories of spend and -- which have a higher propensity for debit versus which have a higher propensity of credit. So when I think about Q3 versus Q4, and while debit grew at a very healthy pace in Q4, it was a little bit at a slower rate than what we saw in Q3, back to your point. It's largely been driven by the fact that the impact of the stimulus we've referred in Q3 started to weigh in Q4. On the flip side, credit performed really, really well. And when I say really well, it was still in negative, but a market improvement in credit because there was a greater spend taking place in discretionary categories, which are credit heavy. So we follow this and we track this pretty closely. And I think that would be the reasons why you should explain what changes are taking place in terms of the mix between debit and credit. Yes, Jason. On the first part of your question, here's what I'd tell you. I would tell you, we're closely watching what these trends are. In the first 3 weeks, we have exactly what you're saying, which is the non-intra-Europe cross-border had started to see a little bit of a recovery come through. There are lots of puts and takes which take place there. And let me try and give you a little bit of color as to what could be driving some of that, right? First, at the end of the day, when you think about this component of non-intra cross-border, there are still several borders which are open. There are people traveling, if you think about U.S.-Mexico, if you think about borders within the Middle East and Africa. I could think about certain travel which is taking place in Asia Pacific. So you might be seeing -- you're seeing a little bit of that come through. The other component which is driving this is, at the end of the day, when we think about other cross-border, we think about it generically speaking in the context of people getting on planes and traveling. But other cross-border is also influenced by expats, people who are sitting in far locations, who have cars, which are -- from their home countries. And the spend patterns on that could be influencing a little bit of what were going on -- what we're seeing here. I wouldn't make too much of the trend we are seeing in the first 3 weeks. We have to watch it for a little bit of a longer period of time. And that's the kind of color I could share with you on that. On your longer-term question on cross-border, look, I got to tell you, we as a company are very encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall availability of a vaccine standpoint. The rollout is something which is still kind of uncertain, and we'll watch how the rollout goes. We believe -- with the availability of vaccines at scale, we believe of the availability of more efficient testing therapeutics. People -- the consumer -- the governments or consumers will come back. Borders will start to be relaxed. And social distancing measures would start to relax. Now we expect that to happen more in the latter half of this year. So [indiscernible] I would tell you, I'm quite optimistic about the fact that we're seeing vaccines, which are proving to be as effective as what the test results would suggest. And we'll see where it all kind of shakes out. I'm really not in a position to give you guidance as it relates to what I think cross-border will look like through the course of 2021. But I feel like if you just stand back and thought about it, the near term and in the longer term, the nearer term will continue to be linear until the vaccine stuff is rolled out at scale. The longer term, we feel very encouraged about. Yes. So Darrin, it's Sachin. On your question around the lapping effect of cross-border, you're right. We saw some cross-border decline start in the later part of February is what I would tell you. But the vast majority of the lapping effect, like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see across all our drivers in the month of March. That's the way I kind of think about what we're seeing here. Yes. So Lisa, just a couple of thoughts around that. I think you're quite familiar with the way we think about what constitutes our yield as a business, right? It's across infrastructure, applications and services. And I would tell you whether it's our card rails or it's our real-time ACH rails or it's open banking. The reality is there's an opportunity to realize revenue across all of these 3 layers: infrastructure, apps and services. And so as we get more in the flow of transactions and/or data, there is the opportunity to realize on all of those levels. If your specific question is around what the interaction of economics will be if payments were to take place over open banking rails or for card rails, well, the reality is we're in the business of providing choice to consumers. And what we're going to do is provide choice, we're getting price for the value we deliver across all of these 3 layers. I think it's a little early to tell you exactly what the actual economics of a transaction over -- for example, open bank rails maybe, but it's a payment transaction. What I can tell you, though, is take something like Pay by Account, which we've launched in the U.K. The economics for us on Pay by Account in the consumer use case in the U.K. are quite similar to our economics out there. Sure. Tim, it's Sachin. So a couple of thoughts. One, we do expect, with the return of travel, the mix will start to come back to a certain level similar to what we saw pre-COVID. It might take a little of time as it relates to the business travel component. But I want to remind you that the vast majority of our travel from a cross-border perspective happens to be personal travel, which we expect to come back and come back based on the comment which Michael made around the pent-up demand. So we'll see that come through. But you're exactly right about other elements of cross-border, whether it's leveraging our real-time rails and the applications in our cross-border manner, real opportunity we feel that as well because today, what we're tapping into is the consumer flows, what we call the person-to-merchant flows, leveraging our card rails in a cross-border environment. The opportunity from a B2B standpoint still remains largely untapped. And this is where our suite of assets from a multi-rail standpoint really will play an important part, whether it's our Send capabilities or the acquisition of Transfast which we did. All of those are key contributing factors. And we're rolling those out pretty nicely. We're building scale, we're building capabilities as we go down that path. So all in all, I tell you, cross-border remains a selling -- decent sized opportunity on a going-forward basis."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and good morning from New York. It certainly feels like a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Mastercard's CEO. I believe the foundation established under Ajay's leadership positions us extremely well for the future. And I'm looking forward to leading Mastercard from here on, and of course, counting on your continued support. Now, 2020 presented the world and the economy with unprecedented challenges. Still, the resilience of our business model and the focused execution of our strategy by our dedicated employees allowed us to close out the year on a positive trajectory. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS growth rates versus a year ago are continuing to show sequential improvement. As we look to the future, we will continue to execute on our strategy. With our ability to enable and secure the payments ecosystem through the partnerships, our differentiated services and our role as a true multi-rail provider, we're well-positioned to capture additional flows and the significant opportunities ahead. These opportunities include certainly the accelerated secular shift to digital payments and the advancement of real-time payments and open banking. Now, let's take a look at our business from the macro level. Retail spending during the holiday season and fourth quarter overall was relatively steady with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4, U.S. retail sales were up 4%, ex auto, ex gas, while overall Europe retail sales slowed with a decline of 1.9% for the quarter, in part due to the recent lockdowns. In Asia, we see some bright spots in markets like Australia and then similarly, in Latin America, where retail sales in Brazil rebounded this quarter. Now, we're also heartened to see the availability of effective COVID vaccines. But distributing them at scale will dictate when social distancing measures can be relaxed and borders opened, and that will ultimately drive further recovery. We see fiscal stimulus, such as the most recent package in the United States, as an important interim measure in the near term. And we're working closely with governments to get funds into people's hands quickly and safely. Now, turning to our business specifically and the four-phased framework we established for monitoring the COVID environment, see markets go through the containment and stabilization phases, and we continue to believe most markets are now in the normalization phase domestically, where spending levels gradually improved with some markets actually approaching growth. Looking at the trends. Volumes continued to modestly improve quarter-over-quarter. And our switched volume growth rates, excluding travel and entertainment, were similar to what we saw in Q4 2019 pre-pandemic. Speaking of travel. Domestic travel, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants, declined slightly in the quarter, reversing some of the improvement we saw in the summer months. Cross-border travel remains limited. In October and November, we saw some improvement in cross-border within the EU, although recent restrictions are causing some slowing over there, as mentioned earlier. Improvement in the cross-border travel outside the EU remains limited. Now we continue to believe travel will improve, starting with personal travel as border restrictions ease and as vaccination efforts expand. We believe corporate travel will follow. As we said in the past, progress may not be linear, but we believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel. And we continue to expect to see improvements in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel, positioning us well to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. So while the pandemic is affecting business drivers in the short term, we have diversified our revenue streams and remain focused on managing our business for the long term. This means focusing on our strategic priorities: one, growing our share of core payments, ensuring the digital experience for our customers, partners and consumers is safe and seamless as we help drive the accelerated secular shift; two, deploying meaningful services that help our partners adapt to the changing environment; and last but not least, providing choice with our multi-rail capabilities. Illustrating all of that, we have quite a number of significant strategic wins this quarter, which I will now share with you. Starting in the U.K. and Ireland and building off the success we've had in debit with Santander and first direct, we're really pleased to expand the long-term relationship we have with NatWest Group of credit. The bank will move its entire debit portfolio to Mastercard across all consumer and business product lines and across multiple brands, including NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. This migration of approximately 16 million debit cards will start later this year and when complete, will contribute to the growing overall debit share in the U.K. from low single digits to approximately 1/3 of the market on all recent wins [ph] that migrated to Mastercard. We look forward to innovating together to build an enhanced digital experience for NatWest's customers across multiple payment rails. Now turning to Germany. We expanded our relationship with Deutsche Bank and will become the exclusive international scheme partner, including both Deutsche and Postbank Banks, expanding our market share in debit and credit. As part of the upcoming migration, a total of 10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued to Mastercard-branded products. Deutsche Bank is already leveraging our services within our existing partnership and will now extend those to the larger customer base and use our advisers' consulting and analytics to assist with the conversion. And we look forward to developing new opportunities together in B2B and other payment flows. In the U.S., we will be the network partner for the Citi Plex account on Google Pay, which leverages our tokenization services to provide Citi Plex customers with a seamless and more secure payment experience. The Citi Plex account will include a digital debit Mastercard that's automatically loaded for use in the Google Pay wallet with an option to request a physical contactless card, providing customers the choice to pay when, where and how they want to pay: by debit card, smartphone or online. Building on our fintech momentum, we have secured additional wins around the globe with new partners like Payoneer and Aeldra in the U.S., HYPE and Flow in Italy, Treezor in France and Prex in Peru. Our fintech customers appreciate our tailored approach, addressing their very specific needs, leveraging our expertise, our tech and of course, our global network. Now we're also excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Walgreens. This multifaceted relationship includes a new credit product to be issued by Synchrony Bank and prepaid products that enable contactless shopping experiences, mobile-first money management and rewards via the Walgreens app. This partnership will enable Walgreens to leverage a number of Mastercard services, including insights and analytics, loyalty and point-of-sale financing, including installments. We will also look into future opportunities together, including a digital-first debit card and other tech-driven solutions to innovate the future of health care payments. Now we remain very active in the U.S. co-brand space, where we extended and expanded our Sam's Club co-brand with enhanced rewards and digital experiences, as announced yesterday, and extended our Walmart consumer credit in co-brands and payroll cards; renewed our GM co-brand, now with Goldman Sachs as the new issuer and expanded our relationship with Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's to include small business. Let's come back to travel. We continue to prepare for the broader return of travel with several new partnerships in this space. First off, building on the travel co-brand momentum we announced last quarter, we will now be the exclusive network for Aeroplan co-brand program in the U.S. with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Air Canada, which will launch later this year. In both the UK and Spain, we're innovating with IAG Loyalty, part of the International Airlines Group, our new co-brand and loyalty partnerships that will provide customers more choices to earn Avios points and reward them with exclusive benefits. And on the wholesale travel program front, one of the largest global online travel agencies, Booking.com, has chosen Mastercard to be their preferred partner for virtual card payments to their suppliers. Let's talk about the change in consumer. As spending patterns change, it is critical to offer online and in-person capabilities, and we have solutions for both. As e-commerce accelerates, with card-not-present transaction accounting for about 45% of our switched volume in 2020, which is up from 40% in 2019, we have several efforts underway to enable safer and more seamless online purchases. Notably, we continue to scale our merchant tokenization services for card-on-file, a critical use case, with a six-fold increase in the number of unique merchants transacting in quarter four versus a year ago. Now, recent surveys tell us that 7 in 10 e-commerce consumers have a payment card information saved with at least one merchant type. Card-on-file tokenization is particularly helpful for subscription services like Netflix, marketplaces like Etsy and ride-hailing services like DiDi who have just signed on this quarter. But we do believe that when restrictions ease, people will return to shopping in person. And hence, we're driving a secular shift in store as well. For example, we saw a strong acceleration of contactless in 2020 as more than 80 markets grew contactless penetration as a percentage of in-person transactions by at least 10%, which is driven by consumer demand for increased speed and safety, but of course, cleanliness at the point of checkout. This paves the way for new solutions that leverage contactless, such as our recently launched Cloud Tap on Phone, which will allow merchants of any size to quickly and easily accept contactless payments on a range of devices, including mobile phones, further expanding our acceptance reach. This will be particularly important for all those hard-hit small businesses trying to operate more digitally coming out of the pandemic. Now with respect to services. Services continue to be in strong demand as we help our customers adapt and succeed in this evolving omnichannel environment we just talked about. In aggregate, our services line represented about 1/3 of our revenues in 2020 and grew at 18% during that period on a currency-neutral basis, providing a critical source of growth and diversification. We will continue to invest in these capabilities across all payment flows to keep the ecosystem secure and to provide key insights to our customers, including publishing monthly trends, leveraging assets such as SpendingPulse. Our recent acquisitions in the services space providing a key source of differentiation are continuing to gain scale. For instance, Bank of America recently expanded its use of Ethoca's dispute management tools. Fintechs in the U.S. and abroad, including American e-commerce company Rappi, are using the behavioral biometric technology of NuData and Transfast [ph] certification process, signing new customers, for RiskRecon to ensure cyber health across their system. And brands like Chico's are leveraging our end-to-end loyalty platform through SessionM. So let's turn our focus on the initiatives that are designed to address a broader set with payment flows with our multi-rail capabilities. They offer the choice and flexibility that consumers, businesses and governments need and increasingly expect. First, we are pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Finicity in November, extending our network to provide data transmission capabilities essentially to fully capitalize on the future of open banking. Finicity continues its leadership in signing direct data access agreements with financial institutions and fintechs, building off existing direct relationships with major banks like Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo. We recently added Chime, Brex, BMO Harris, Charles Schwab and ED Bank, [ph] and we're moving quickly to secure more direct access relationships. Finicity continues to build out its digital assets and credit decisioning solutions, including those launched with 4 leading mortgage companies, and have seen rapid adoption of its lending and payment solutions. In parallel, we continue to expand our open banking capabilities in Europe and intend to leverage Finicity there as well. In the real-time space, we're excited that Payments Canada has selected Mastercard to build and run its new real-time payment systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure. Our technology and expertise will power our best-in-class real-time payment infrastructure that provides a platform for innovation to enhance Canada's economy. With this win, we are now providing real-time payments infrastructure for 12 of the top 50 GDP countries, extending our global footprint. Relating to these new infrastructure wins, we continue to build out applications that leverage real-time payment rails like with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, which is now live with real-time payments and batch ACH in the U.S. alongside our card functionalities. We've also extended Track's card payment capabilities worldwide and now continuing to build out our network with a number of bank and nonbank partners that considerably extend our reach on both the buyer and supplier side. This year, we plan to continue expanding the platform into new geographies and add our cross-border payment capabilities. We're also delivering on our multi-rail promise with Mastercard Send, which continues to grow across the globe. For example, we expanded our reseller network by deepening our long-standing relationship with Citi to enable them to offer business-to-consumer disbursements in the U.S. This is one of several new partnerships leveraging Mastercard Send to enable B2C and person-to-person money transfers domestically and internationally. We also partnered with TransferGo, enabling customers across 20 European countries to make international money transfers from any card or bank account directly to a Mastercard debit or credit card. Now let's take a look into the future. As you've surely heard, there's a lot going on in the digital currency space, with many governments around the world evaluating central bank digital currencies. When a country chooses to issue its own CBDC like the pilots we've seen in countries like Sweden or China or instead, it provides a regulatory framework for private stable points or otherwise pursues both public and private options in parallel, we are engaged to central banks through our policy and the solution perspective. We've continued to invest in this space to be ready to co-invest with governments, banks and fintech partners. For example, the virtual test platform that we launched a short time ago is being received well. And our cryptocard programs, including Wirex in the U.K. and Uphold in the U.S., enable consumers to spend their crypto balances within our acceptance network. This year, we plan on adding digital currency controlled directly on our network, enabling our partners to take advantage of our acceptance reach and settlement capabilities. This will give choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants for what currency they want to use or receive. Our level of support will vary based on regulations in a given market. It will continue to be guided by our published principles on security, compliance and consumer protections and the value to our stakeholders in determining our involvement in a specific initiative. So there's certainly a lot going on and significant opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin. So, Craig, I can take that question. I just want to make sure you're still around. Craig, can you hear us? Okay. We're working on it. Yes, we're just working on it. Let me try and take that so I can \u2013 [Technical Difficulty] a question on what the impact of the [Technical Difficulty] A couple of things [Technical Difficulty]. There is no change in our pricing either. Specifically on your question on payment [Technical Difficulty] once the transaction ended on the 31st of December of last year, the UK effectively became subject to the same interchange [Technical Difficulty] any other non-EU countries as agreed with the European Commission. And recognizing the prevailing pandemic, what we did is we set the timing of the change we commenced in October of 2021. We are very aware of the challenges which are being faced by retailers, businesses and people [Technical Difficulty] this pandemic. And we continue to view the timing of the implementation of this position as we go forward -- look forward for this year. Yes, I can hear you. Good. And on the central bank digital currency front, Ramsey, so here's multiple ways that Mastercard can be helpful. As I was saying earlier, first of all, we are engaging with governments all around the world, really, first on a basis to find out what is the path forward when it comes to modernizing the payment stack on a given country. So is it the right tool for the job? And the conclusion is, it is the right tool for the job and then we will certainly partner, but I would also say that you will find situations where real-time payment is a better answer because it just happens to exist already, and it lives in the existing financial infrastructure. But let's come back to CBDCs. We have a few principles that we put out into the market and which I'm happy to see is shared by most leading central banks around the world, and that is that you start off with recognizing there's different roles between a central bank and a private sector bank. You don't -- you want your lender of last resort. You want, so to say, the mining of the currency in any one of the private sector to bring utility to the currency for consumers or for businesses and so forth, so a 2-tier approach. And our partnership is with both sectors in this case. Private sector to say what utility could be brought? What's the functionality that makes a difference, let's say, when you want to pay with a cryptocurrency in a store. And here, that is where we bring to bear our acceptance network, for example. So the IP that we have that links the cryptocurrency that's trading on our network is a very tangible example of what we could do. Then you think about other aspects here is that it's generally the last-mile question. It is also consumer protection. It is transparency. It is business models around that. And it is using fundamentally the nature of the distributed ledger technology that is put to use here. And if you could imagine a world where there's a bunch of smart contracts riding on a government-issued CBDC, and that is very similar to what we do in terms of applications in the real-time space, all what we do with debit and credit in the card space, underlying set of rails which we participate in and then we help bring utility across governments and private sector. That's the play. Early stages, but we will support. And we today only carry CF currency in our network. And when this makes its way, then we'll carry CBDCs in our network. Yes. So let me take the first part of the question and then Sachin can talk a little bit more about the pipeline and so forth. Now this big win, NatWest, but then looking at the other strategic relationship with Walgreens, Deutsche Bank, if I look at some of the aspects that recently driven or wins, these ones specifically but broader -- the broader portfolio, it is our capabilities across one set of rails. You heard me talk earlier about it. We're going to want to co-innovate with NatWest on multiple payment rails. So certainly a differentiated capability matters, particularly in Europe, where the rival of real-time payment is absolutely real. Then you think about aspects in these markets, there is -- open banking is a little more pronounced than in other markets. So again, it's an additional capability that's a differentiator that we have with open banking connect in Europe. You look into digital-first capabilities. So again, something that played out over the last 2 years in Europe. So I would summarize it, Tien-tsin, as innovation. Certainly, pricing and all that matters. But the fact that there is something else that we can bring to the party and our solution selling approach brings it all together across services, multi-rail and what we do in our core business. So I think that's generally the story. And how that's changing to, let's say, 2 years ago? Well, multi-rail, with the Canada venue just saw it, we're growing our reach if something that is matters in so many more markets today. So we're just advancing the strategy, and then we can bring it all to bear in a case like this. Yes. And just one point to add then. What we've seen in previous challenged periods in terms of economic outlook, there is -- in a downturn, debit is all generally preferred. And the main reason for that is people really want to spend the money that they have and avoid taking on extra burden in terms of additional debt. So this is a normal pattern that we have seen and it plays out in a way that Sachin just talked about. Well, thank you. Just an aspect to add here. And that is that there's distinction between personal travel and corporate travel. We've seen it in the summer, this past summer 2020. The reaction, once consumer confidence increases, turned right up into travel increasing because people want to get on with their lives. They want to see their friends, their families and whatever. So the reaction of personal travel, too, driven by consumer confidence, which will in turn be driven by the vaccine rollout Sachin just talked about, I think, was going to be relatively near term. Corporate travel, that will take longer. Video tools, we should have actually used the video tool today maybe. You just see that, that is an additional way of getting together. Yes, people want to see their customers. How that will play out, we don't exactly know. But back to personal travel, that is a significant majority of our travel portfolio. And all the wins that we had recently, they're going to kick at this time. So medium term, we're encouraged. All right. And Darrin, on the questions on the trends, what makes the trends? That's like -- that's the key question here. Certainly, we started a digitization trend that's been around for years, accelerate dramatically. I think it's fair to say that years have been compressed into months. So what part of that will stick? When I look at what we're going to see as structural changes, as sticking trends, I fundamentally believe that e-commerce is not going to revert back to what it was. So no back to quarter 4 2019. I think the general attitude towards cash is going to remain more negative than before. The surveys that we've done every single month since April of last year is telling us that consumers -- broadly speaking, 60% of consumers have a somewhat more negative attitude towards cash now, and we don't think that will change. 70% of consumers, they're going to do more digital banking, more online purchasing and more contactless. So I think that will just remain. As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, once you can venture out there and social distancing measures are relaxed, people will want to go and shop in their stores, in their local community, support the local restaurant, whatever it is. But the good experience, as people started to appreciate and learn online, that will not go away. So the good thing is we'll have 2 legs to stand on with our business. We'll benefit from both of them. Other structural trends that I see is more digital transactions, more data, more desire to understand the data. Data Insights, our service portfolio is on point for that. The same as more digital transactions, larger cyber footprint, potentially more risks. And a bunch of new businesses coming online that have been brick-and-mortar only, that's an opportunity for us from a cybersecurity perspective. And then there's a whole cross-border [indiscernible] digitizing supply chains, B2B. I would say that's the other structural change that people take away from the pandemic. Yes. That's a pretty broad question, Lisa. So let me tick the first part of it, and then Sachin can talk around the economics and the business all behind that. Broadly speaking, the way we look at open banking is, it's adding data transmission capabilities as well as an additional set of transaction rails. We can initiate payments through open banking, permission API connections. We can do that. But we also can just verify assets or help in credit decisioning. So it's a wide range of use cases, and we're pretty agnostic what they are. We're quite happy to initiate payments directly through reassigned payment rails but also the combination of a market where there is real-time payment infrastructure. There is an open banking regulation as in Europe. The fact that we have a strong position in both allows us to leverage the combination of that quite effectively. That is one of the things that Tesco does with us. The proposition that Tesco is offering is you pay your credit card very simply through an open banking connection, leveraging the real-time payment rails. That's check, check, check, and it's a good combination for us. Overall, where is this going to go? I see it as an additional leg in our multi-rail strategy. So one link into Mastercard. You want to pay through an open banking trend link, you want to pay through real-time payments, you want to pay through cards, whatever it is, one thing is through Mastercard. That's the overall strategy. Finicity helps us clearly in the United States. But as I said before, these use cases that they have on asset verification and on credit decisioning, they are so in demand at this point in time. Taking them to Europe as quickly as possible will matter. Now Sachin can help you unravel some of these business models behind that. Yes. But broadly speaking, I think fair to say we are agnostic. It's about choice. If the market want to go the one way, then the market will go one way and we'll partner it. And otherwise, it goes a different way, we'll partner it. And Tim, back to my earlier comments around structural changes, B2B and supply chain. A big part of the supply chain insight that people have just gained over the last 9 months is that there's dependency on parts of the supply chain cross-border that they want to digitize and this -- so they can be more flexible to change suppliers in future scenarios. Now here, we come in with Transfast. We come in with our announced acquisition of HomeSend, the combination of all of that. And then you take this multi-rail capabilities, picture this in the context of Track, where there's a data switch, all the data that you want alongside with your B2B transaction is coming along and you choose whichever way you want to send it. Use case of like remittances by our supplier payments, which make up about $110 trillion of global flows. Significant opportunities for us, we got the assets in place. Yes. Don, that's a good question to round this call off, I think a very, very wide-ranging question. You have a lot of elements that you put in there. So let me go at this from a couple of perspectives. The first is our focus, just want to run you was, these are partners, these are customers, and we have strong relationships with all of them. Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you name it. And just think about the Apple Card as an example there. When you then look forward, you look at where is the world going in terms of different rails, in terms of emerging technologies, in terms of 5G. So there's a lot of change from a technology side in our ecosystem and here's big tech players. But what I'm finding is that our specialist role here and our focus specific on payment technology makes us a very relevant partner. Most of these companies are oriented and focused on delivering a particularly good consumer experience, digital user experience to their customer base, trying to keep customers in their ecosystem, whatever they might be doing, if they're a social network or something like that. And we stand the role of being the payments partner. That is a model of interaction that I think will continue to evolve. Some of these players do have payment aspirations. And Don, that's where your question is going. But then you look at our services portfolio. You look at our capabilities like card-on-file tokenization and so forth. We help them with our services portfolio while they create quite a nice consumer front-end experience. The xPays is a good example for that. And as long as there's choice and underlying payment tools, we're quite happy to partner because it drives the overall digital, the acceleration of the digital trend. In terms of change in political regime and the incoming administration and the view on big tech, that is for them to comment on. Basically, we're guided by our partnership. We're going to lean in and continue to drive our business. Overall, otherwise, it's early days. We have a great dialogue with the incoming administration. They're interested in payments which we generally like. This is, by the way, the trend around the world. Governments interested in payments is critical national infrastructure, and we engage in that dialogue, topics of cybersecurity and data principles where we're all a leading voice and that's how we engage. Yes. My blood pressure is slowly coming down again after this little hump earlier. No, thank you for the questions. Really appreciate the interest and the dialogue. Don't want to repeat anything. Just -- I have to go back one more time to 2020. That was a challenging year for the industry. That was certainly something that made us -- needed us to be as agile as we could possibly be. And I just want to comment again that our employees really stepped up and allowed us to close out the year on this positive trajectory. Now we said on a number of occasions throughout this call here, we're optimistic about COVID recovery, really in the light of the vaccine being deployed. We're optimistic about cross-border coming back driven by the exact same point. So in the near term, there's optimism. In the very, very long term, there is optimism. I want to make one more point. All of this is great from an economic perspective and a performance perspective. What is equally important is that we do the right thing for communities and for our planet. And this week, I'm really proud and so many people at Mastercard are as we put out our net zero commitment. And that is just the last thought I want to leave you with that. With that, looking forward to speaking to you with less technical issues in a quarter from now. Thank you very much."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Casey, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you are all safe and sound. With me today are Ajay Banga, our Chief Executive Officer; Michael Miebach, our President; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay, Michael and Sachin, the Operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.  Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted, but the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.\nAjay Banga: Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. We are now a few quarters into the pandemic. And while individuals and businesses and society at large continue to face many challenges, we are also seeing some positive trends, both in terms of the trajectory of spending and the acceleration of digital payments that we are helping enable. For example, our SpendingPulse estimates for quarter three show U.S. retail sales up 1.8% versus a year ago, ex-auto, ex-gas. We've also seen positive numbers in countries like the United Kingdom. Looking at the trends, volumes improved throughout the third quarter. In fact, if you exclude travel and entertainment, which has been particularly hard hit, our switched volume growth rates in September were similar to what we saw before the pandemic in Q4 of 2019. Using our four-phased framework, we have seen markets go through the containment and stabilization phases, and now we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. And so, consistent with this, we have seen our revenue going in the right direction this quarter as year-over-year currency-neutral growth was 3 percentage points better than last quarter, and the domestic spending trends so far in October continue to remain steady. Now, we have seen some improvement in domestic travels in the quarter, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants. Cross-border travel, however, remains constrained. And while we have seen some improvement in travel within the EU during the quarter, cross-border travel outside the EU has shown only limited recovery. We believe travel improve and consumer confidence recovers as a result of improved testing and safety protocols being put in place, medical advances occurring and as border restrictions are lifted, and there is increased international coordination of travel cross-borders. When cross-border travel does improve, we will be very well-positioned to capitalize on that recovery. So, overall, we see signs of improvement. But, we\u2019re not out of the woods yet, as we are seeing in places like Europe restriction being put back in place. As we said in the past, progress through the phases may not be linear. It's going to take some time. And it will be positively impacted by the broad availability of successful therapeutics and vaccines. During this time, we remain focused on the things we can control, continue to execute against our strategy, invest in our business for the longer term and manage our expenses in a disciplined way. Our digital technologies help us drive the secular shift to electronic forms of payment that support our broad range of customers, banks, fintechs, neobanks and merchants. We are growing our core payment capabilities in credit, debit, prepaid and commercial with new and renewed deals. Our services, which are helping our customers and consumers adapt to the changing environment are continuing to grow well, and they provide meaningful differentiation and revenue diversification. And our multi-rail capabilities are providing choice to customers and consumers by addressing a wide range of payment flows. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Ajay. Picking up where Ajay left off, we're positioning ourselves for the future by driving this accelerated shift towards electronic payments. According to our research, almost 7 in 10 people globally say the shift will likely be permanent. We believe that as the economies reopen, people will shop in stores again. But, e-commerce will remain elevated from pre-pandemic levels as behaviors have changed and payment preferences have shifted. Our research also shows that about 60% of consumers plan to use less cash, even after the pandemic subsides. As a result, merchants are becoming more digital and consumers and businesses are adapting how they interact at the point of sale, both in-person and online. Regardless of how these trends play out, our solutions are available to support consumers, issuers and merchants. The debt preferences and needs evolve, be it in store or online. And we are partnering with digital enablers to bring our digital solutions to market at speed and at scale. Let me give you some examples. First, consumers. Consumers want choice. Whether they want to pay using contactless, card-on-file, QR or via installments, we are enabling that choice. Contactless growth continues to be fueled by increasing consumer adoption. In the third quarter, contactless penetration represented 41% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 37% in the second quarter and 30% a year ago. At the same time, we are enabling a safe and simplified experience for consumers across digital channels with our tokenization capabilities. This foundational technology is growing rapidly with the number of tokenized transactions doubling year-over-year in the third quarter, now accounting for 8% of our switched transactions. We're also enabling more consumers to participate in digital commerce. For example, Santander Chile has rolled out digital debit Mastercard to all of their Maestro card holders. This quarter alone, we won deals that will lead to about 10 million Maestro cards being migrated to Debit Mastercard in the near future. Second, let's talk about issuance. We have a set of digitally enabled products and solutions that drive this accelerated secular shift, including digital-first solutions tailored to fintechs and neobanks, and issuing plans with which we have an established leadership position. We're partnering with large global players like PayPal, as we make the PayPal business Debit Mastercard available to businesses in five new markets in Europe, in addition to its current availability in the U.S., the UK and Germany. We've extended our deals neobank, one of the world's largest neobanks, and will maintain a leadership position with them in Brazil as one of the new markets as they expand their operations in Mexico and Colombia. Mastercard also helps fintechs build and scale their businesses. We've signed several deals with fast-growing neobanks around the world, like Nickel in France and Bnext in Spain. Third, we're focused on helping merchants, merchants as they shift to digital and develop omnichannel capabilities. For instance, we launched a POS capability in India with Worldline and Axis Bank that transforms smartphones into point-of-sale terminals with the ability to accept contactless QR and remote payments. In the buy now, pay later space, in addition to our previous partner announcements, we recently announced the partnership with TSYS to deliver installment capabilities to issuers. In addition, we're also piloting simplified shopping experiences using AI and computer vision, such as enhanced drive-thrus at White Castle and Sonic, and checkout-free pilots at Dunkin' and Circle K. And finally, we're partnering with digital enablers to bring our digital solutions to market. We just announced an expanded partnership with Marqeta, a digital processor, to introduce new products and launch additional card programs in new geographies. And talking about geographies, in Africa, we have partnered with Samsung, Airtel Africa and Asante to enable access to digital financing to consumers, entrepreneurs and merchants. In parallel, we're driving hard-to-grow our core products, leveraging these differentiated digital capabilities to set ourselves up well for the future. In the U.S., we are excited about our partnership with Chase to launch the new Freedom Flex Mastercard, offering card members cash back on everyday spend as well as our leading world of these benefits. We also expanded our relationship with Barclays Bank U.S., which will now include new products and services in addition to their consumer and small business credit portfolios. In Europe, we continue to strengthen our position. We signed a regional agreement with the Santander Group for their card business, securing a long-term partnership. We're also extending our relationship with ING, as they grow internationally. And we've agreed to a long-term renewal with Swedbank, our largest customer in the Nordics and Baltics, which will become an exclusive Mastercard customer. On the co-brand front, in the U.S., the Wayfair Mastercard with Citi has launched. And, we will be the new exclusive network for the AARP Credit co-brand program. In Canada, we have extended our co-brand relationship with Walmart. And we're happy that Taobao just launched its Mastercard co-brand issued by Bank of China in Hong Kong and Macau. We're also focused on positioning ourselves for the return of travel. This includes partnerships with Emirates Skywards on their first co-brand credit card in the U.S. and a renewal of our exclusive co-brand agreement with Miles & More, the largest traveler loyalty program in Europe on their German portfolio. It also includes a focus on travel-oriented portfolios like WEX that you've heard us talk about over the last several quarters. We're also working hard to improve cross-border approval rates and optimize portfolios now with Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Analytics Services. Now, speaking of services, it is important to note that our services have played a critical role enabling the wins I just mentioned. For example, our renewal and extension with ING will include our data analytics and data insights services. Services are a material driver of our revenue growth and a source of diversification while we help our customers adapt quickly and securely as they navigate through the pandemic into a rapidly digitizing world. One way we're helping our customers is through our cyber services and the use of artificial intelligence, an area we have been investing in both organically and inorganically. We have developed a broad set of scalable AI capabilities, which have been integrated into our network, our products and services. And here are some examples. Citibank is assessing our AI platform to determine enhanced capabilities to mitigate credit losses. And Ita\u00fa and Santander Mexico are using our AI to provide added security for consumers while ensuring good transactions are approved. And with that, let's turn to the account to account space, where we believe there are significant incremental flows to address. For the last several years, we've developed a set of assets to comprehensively address these opportunities at the infrastructure, applications and services layers. We believe this combination allows us to best address the broad range of customer needs. At the infrastructure level, we continue to make good progress with our build-outs and have a strong position in all major geographic regions, including key markets like the U.S., the UK, Nordics and Saudi Arabia. Building off our strong position in infrastructure, we're also making good progress in the application layer, utilizing our multi-rail capabilities. Starting on the consumer-to-merchant front. The Pay by Bank app in the UK, which extends our ability to compete for everyday spend along with our debit products, is growing both in consumer accounts and merchant acceptance. With Barclays set to launch with their 9 million mobile banking app customers before the end of the year, together with their customers already onboarded by HSBC, we will have around a third of the UK mobile banking customers enabled. We have streamlined our merchant onboarding process and currently have more than 700 merchants signed up, such as the WHSmith Group. At our distribution partners like Workday and others, we are well positioned to expand acceptance even further. In the bill pay space, several new partners will be supporting the Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange, including FIS, Wescom Credit Union, Payrailz and MoCaFi on the consumer side and COBRA, PNC Bank and CSG on the biller side. Bill Pay Exchange will now have access to approximately a third of bills paid annually in the U.S. and be able to reach about a quarter of active U.S. Bill Pay consumers. In the B2B, we continue to develop the ecosystem around Mastercard Track Business Payment Service with Fiserv now live on the platform. We are also excited to announce an expansion of our longstanding strategic relationship with PayPal, who can now use Mastercard Send to power fund transfers to consumers and small businesses through all their brands, including Braintree, Zoom, Hyperwallet and iZettle. And finally, we are continuing to make progress in the services layer, including consulting, fraud prevention and a recent extension in the UK for our trace anti-money laundering services. In summary, we're managing our business through this normalization phase with agility, winning share and have good deal momentum. We're driving the accelerated shift towards digital payments, and our clients see us differentiating ourselves with our services. We see domestic volumes rebound and are positioning ourselves well for the medium to long-term growth opportunity, including the return of travel through continued investment in our strategic priorities. With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and operational metrics.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. So, turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impact of gains and losses on the Company's equity investments. Net revenue was down 14%, reflecting the impacts of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were down 5% year-over-year or down 8%, if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 20% and net income was down 26%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was down 25% year-over-year to $1.60, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $2.1 billion worth of stock and an additional $392 million through October 23, 2020. So, let's turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4% with debit growth of 20%, partially offset by a credit decline of 12%. Outside of the U.S., volume was flat. Cross-border volume was down 36% globally for the quarter. As we have previously mentioned, the pace of recovery in lower yielding intra-Europe volumes is stronger than other cross-border, which is higher yielding. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 23%, whereas other cross-border volume was down 49% as border restrictions were eased in Europe in advance of other locations. Turning to page 5. Switched transactions showed growth of 5% in the third quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless that Michael mentioned earlier. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.7 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 14% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV switched transactions and continued growth in services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. As a reminder, the transaction with Nets did not close this quarter, as previously expected. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 5%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Cross-border volume fees decreased 48%, while cross-border volume decreased 36%. The 12 ppt difference is due to adverse cross-border mix, mainly driven by a slower recovery in non-intra-Europe cross-border volumes that are high yielding than intra-Europe cross-border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 1%, while switched transactions were up 5%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by the adverse cross-border mix I just mentioned. Other revenues were up 6%, including a 2 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data and Services solutions. Also, just as a reminder, growth in other revenues was impacted by a difficult year-ago comp. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 2%. Moving on to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses decreased 5%. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions, which was lower than expected, primarily due to a delay in the closing of the transaction with Nets. Excluding acquisitions, expenses decreased 8%, which was also better than expectations, primarily related to actions taken to reduce advertising and marketing, travel, personnel costs and professional fee-related expenses. Turning to page 8. Let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. One point to note, while the week ending October 21st shows higher growth metrics relative to the prior week, this is being primarily driven by the timing of significant promotional activity by an e-com merchant and their competitors. Through the first three weeks of October, each of the metrics are in line with recent trends, adjusting for this e-com promotional activity. Commenting on the specific metrics, starting with switched volumes, we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. When you look at how people are spending, card-present growth rates remain steady, with strength in retail categories such as groceries, offset by some declines in T&E. Card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady, benefiting from increased contactless penetration. In terms of cross-border, intra-Europe continues to outpace other cross-border volumes. As previously mentioned, intra-Europe yields are lower than those of other cross-border volumes. So now turning to page 9, I'd like to provide you additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we laid out through the course of the quarter continue. The e-com promotional activity I referenced also impacted cross-border growth for the week ending October 21st. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border continues in a similar band. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend has declined slightly, following an uptick in travel over the summer holiday season. Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present excluding online travel-related spend and remains positive. We continue to see strong growth across retail categories, particularly in discretionary areas like clothing and home improvement as well as in nondiscretionary categories such as groceries. This line was particularly impacted by the e-com promotional activity. One final point regarding all metrics. Given the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, we are closely monitoring the impact on spending of additional mitigation measures that are being put in place, particularly in Europe. Turning to page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on the upcoming quarter. As we previously established, given the ongoing uncertainty, we will not be providing a forward view for net revenues at this time. We do intend, however, to continue to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics to help you understand the trends we are seeing. First, I'd like to make a few comments on how I see our business shaping up in light of the pandemic. The story in non-T&E domestic volumes is quite encouraging. Specifically, as Ajay mentioned, we are seeing volume growth rates ex-T&E in September, similar to what we were seeing pre-COVID in Q4 2019. The impact of the pandemic on travel and, in particular, on non-intra-Europe cross-border travel, remain significant. While we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel, and we believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year. As a reminder, we will see improved growth rates due to lapping the effects of the pandemic before that, starting in late March next year. All of this being said, we have always been well-positioned in the cross-border travel space, and we continue to build on this position of strength through various initiatives with existing and new partners, as Michael commented on. This will enable us to capitalize on the recovery in cross-border when it does occur. With that as background, I'd like to make a couple of comments to help you with your modeling of revenues for the quarter. First, as you have seen, non-intra-Europe cross-border travel has seen minimal recovery since the onset of pandemic. Given that these volumes are significantly higher yielding than intra-Europe cross-border, this has resulted in a slower recovery in our cross-border revenues. As a reminder, this negative mix impacts both our cross-border volume fees and transaction processing fees, as you have seen in Q3. This will continue to be a factor, so long as this mix persists. Secondly, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to increase by 2 to 3 ppt sequentially, reflecting normal seasonal trends and increased deal activity, as Michael mentioned. Now let's turn to operating expenses. Consistent with our four-phased framework, we\u2019re managing through the pandemic and given that we are in the normalization phase, we continue to carefully manage our priorities in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, digital, cyber, data and analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q4, we expect operating expenses to be down low single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our continued focus on expense management as well as sequentially higher advertising and marketing spend related to promotional campaigns. With respect to M&A, we are pleased with the progress we have made toward securing regulatory approval for the transaction with Nets and now expect that transaction to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on this timing and the planned closing of the Finicity acquisition this quarter, we expect acquisitions to contribute 0.5 ppt to revenue and approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Other items to keep in mind for Q4. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind to revenues and a 0 to 1 ppt headwind to operating expenses. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20% for the quarter, based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Sachin. Casey, we're now ready for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, synthesizing everything you're saying and piecing together what you said on cross-border, it sounds like, effectively, we should be modeling an extended period here of depressed yields perhaps, through the start of 2022. Is that how you're thinking about things?\nSachin Mehra: Hey Craig, it's Sachin. So, let me take that one. I think, the thing to actually focus on is the following. When you think about cross-border, you think about intra-Europe cross-border and non-intra-Europe cross-border. But, the other dimension you should think about is personal travel relative to business travel. And, I think, what you should -- our expectation in terms of how we think things will evolve is going to be tied to the availability of vaccines and therapeutics. Our view is personal travel comes back quicker than business travel does. Personal travel for Mastercard represents a substantial portion of our total cross-border. So, the way I would think about that is to think about in the context of, as travel starts to come back, we'll see personal travel, which is a substantial portion of our total cross-border come back sooner than business travel. And that should be tied to how we see the evolution of the COVID vaccine and the therapeutics taking place. That's the way I would think about it.\nCraig Maurer: Okay. Considering the other commentary you had, refresh our memory in terms of the yield dynamic in card-not-present/e-com versus card-present, considering it seems that obviously the direction is favoring e-com at this point.\nSachin Mehra: Look, I mean, here is what I tell you, in terms of the opportunity for yields on card-present versus card-not-present is the way you should think about it, generally, at the baseline, the yields are pretty consistent. Clearly, when you have card-not-present transactions, you have the opportunity to leverage the strong capabilities we at Mastercard have from a services standpoint, such as our fraud and analytics capabilities, which when layered on and are more relevant in the card-not-present environment, cause for the yields to be higher in card-not-present over card-present.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Once again, Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned on the call that tokenization -- I think, this is the first time you've disclosed some of these metrics. So, digging into them. Tokenization doubled -- tokenized transactions, I guess, doubled year-on-year, and it's now 8% of the total. Can you elaborate a little bit on what's going on with tokenization? Specifically, how is the implementation of SCA in Europe impacting the rollout of tokenization? And then, what kind of tools are you using to drive this rollout? So, for example, at some point, would you implement a liability shift or something like that similar to what you did with EMV, or kind of how was this expected to roll out over the next couple of years, especially in light of this dramatic shift into e-com? Thank you.\nAjay Banga: Hey Lisa, it's Ajay. And I'm going to kick it off, and I'm going to let Michael. He is the European export. First, tokenization to us is building the foundation for safe, secure and frictionless online contactless kind of commerce. But, think of tokenization as being extendable also to card-present transactions eventually. So that wherever card data exchanges hand in any form, the actual data that exchanges hands is not the data that can be reused without unlocking cryptocurrency. That's the objective. Then also, therefore, provides us with a terrific rail to see more transactions than we used to in the past, which by the way is one of the reasons why our transaction percentage, as we see, is growing up from -- over the last decade from 40-something percent to 55-plus percent today. And that enables our data and services business to power itself on a higher level of growth. That's the logic of tokenization. That's the investment in it. The fact that it's now 8%, which is kind of doubling over last year in terms of number of transactions, you should view that as a continuing trend that we are going to push as hard as we can with every ounce of energy in our selling system. That's the first part of the answer. Does it connect to Europe? Yes, not yet any differently from others because secure customer authentication, SCA, is still not fully implemented, as you know, in Europe because there was an extension granted on how well that will go through. Will that be very much helped by tokenization? Yes, but not yet in those numbers. So, what you're seeing is really efforts across the board, across markets, across geographies for us to build a foundation for this very simple smart commerce of the future.\nMichael Miebach: Despite the fact that Ajay isn't European, I think, he told the European story. The only thing I would add is, as we did the foundational work over the last two, three years around tokenization, particularly the merchant tokenization, our MPRM [ph] product, we've made the implementation so much easier. We're talking about a very light lift for merchants, which is driving some of this acceleration here.\nAjay Banga: And by the way, Lisa, this is useful for merchants, as Michael said. It's useful for fintech. It's useful for banks. It's useful from a point of view of governments, because it adds the security in the system. This is a good thing. And it's standardized across the industry, which makes it get to scale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: When we look at the other revenue line, it just was -- it seems a little more than we had expected. If you could just give a little more detail on to what went into that and really the investments you're making in that category, which I know is sort of a catch all for a lot of the newer services you have. What should we expect from that over the next year or two in terms of opportunities for further investment in growth in that area? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So Darren, so in other revenue, as we kind of previously discussed, it's got -- a large part of our services revenue sits there. There are several other revenue items related to acquisitions, which we've done in the services area, which kind of again sit in that. So, there's a bunch of stuff which goes in the other revenue line item. I think the way you should think about it is the following. Our services capabilities and the revenue we generate from our services capabilities continue to be in great demand in the marketplace and they're growing well. Bottom line, point number one, really important for us to get out there, because there is a lot of demand coming from our customers on that. What you are seeing in terms of other revenue growth in Q3 is -- and the reason it's -- we grew at 6% ex acquisitions that grew at about 4%. We had a tough year-over-year comp. Last year, that other revenue line item was growing at 30% ex acquisitions. And so, look, at the end of the day, last year the growth rate we had was driven by some really strong demand in the third quarter for our consulting capabilities, which came through there. And really, what I would say is longer term, the way you should think about services in general and other revenue as well is they continue to grow faster than the core. They're in good demand in the marketplace, including those which we've developed organically, as well as the acquisitions we've done, including things like Ethoca, RiskRecon, all of which, candidly in the current prevailing environment with increased digitalization are even in more demand. So, that's the way I think about it.\nAjay Banga: The only thing I'll add to that -- this is Ajay, is that the services in other revenue is a number of different businesses. It's not one thing. So, there's data analytics, there's loyalty, there's cybersecurity. So, it can create some lumpiness across quarters. But, those -- when we started out 10 years ago, that was 4%, 5% of our revenue. It is currently running -- Sachin, at what level?\nSachin Mehra: So, it's north of 25%...\nAjay Banga: Somewhere between 25% and 30% of our revenue, depending on the quarter. So, you can imagine the focus that Michael and team are putting into it, you should expect to see more activity in that space in data analytics, in AI, in cybersecurity. You should expect Michael to be continually driving new differentiation there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Just a question on the M&A side. It seems like there is a lot more regulatory overview of acquisitions by large tech companies like -- including Visa and Mastercard. You sound very optimistic about closing Finicity and Nets; obviously, these are getting a lot of overview on flat. Are you seeing a lot more -- a lot heavier regulatory review of acquisitions? And, does that change your M&A strategy at all?\nMichael Miebach: Hey Bob, Michael here. So, we're actively engaging on the two that you mentioned. That's Nets and that's Fincity. As Sachin pointed out earlier, we are confident that Nets will close into the first quarter. We're very happy that we get the intrinsical approval from the EU Commission there. We're working through the remedy. So, that is a process that's well-understood and on track for us. So, a high level of confidence there. When it comes to Finicity, we continue to be quite optimistic as we work this through and it will close in the fourth quarter. Now, the level of oversight and engagement around antitrust topics, we're obviously aware of that. And we're following a news as everybody else does. Now, when we look at Finicity where the confidence that I've just talked about there really relates to why we like Finicity. We like Finicity because they have really strong data management practices. We like them because they have in a light of day set of relationships with banks and with fintechs on both sides, so very transparent business model. We like them particularly because of the approach that they took to create a world of open banking that really favors the consumer to use their data with their consent and only with their consent. They created the financial data exchange around it, which is now the emerging standard globally on how to do open banking in a proper way. So, we feel really quite good about that. Other acquisitions, as they come, we'll continue to work that within the respective regulatory environment. So, not any change to our M&A strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: I just wanted to ask two things. First, just the delta between switched transaction growth and transaction processing revenue growth, I think there was about a four-point spread there? And then, just a number of issuers have talked about improved U.S. credit volumes in September and October. Wondering if you guys saw that as well as you deconstruct the domestic volume numbers. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Hi Jason, it's Sachin. On transaction processing fees and the delta between transaction processing fees and the growth in switched transactions, it is primarily being driven by the adverse cross-border mix. As you know, there is a component of our cross-border revenues which come in transaction processing fees. And when the proportionate share of intra-Europe versus non-intra-Europe is tilting towards in favor of intra-Europe transactions, it has the adverse impact, which is what you're seeing come through there. And in Q3, that's exactly what's kind of driving that delta. On your second question on performance of credit, we do have actually seen an improvement in credit performance quarter-over-quarter, much in line with what you're learning from the issuer side. In fact, I would say, across all regions, there has been good improvement in our volume metrics. And the reality is, as we are starting to see strength come through relative to the second quarter in terms of domestic volumes and transactions, that's manifesting itself in the debit improvements we've seen as well as on the credit side. So, it's very consistent with what we're hearing fromthe issuance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nTien-tsin Huang: I know a lot of questions on yields and I understand that geography matters on cross-border. I think, Craig asked about card-present versus card-not-present. But, just in general, any comments or anything -- any call-outs on product mix and how that impacts your yields as well as maybe even client mix, if more spending is going to bigger merchants and marketplaces, any call-outs there?\nSachin Mehra: Hi. Tien-tsin. So, the color, which in addition to the commentary, which we've just shared around yields in general as well as the mix shift, which is taking place between intra-Europe cross-border and non-intra-Europe cross-border is, travel, by and large happens to be more credit-oriented. And recovery of travel ties closely to how the metrics show up on credit as well. And so, the only point I can make is that as we start to see travel come back, which we very well expect to come back, and like I said, personal travel probably before business travel. I think, from a product standpoint, what you can expect to see is that the credit volumes start to come back in a more meaningful manner, just because that's the more prominent product to use there. The other piece is certainly prepaid as well in the travel business. As you know, we've got a bunch of prepaid products, which are very focused on travel-oriented business. And that too we'll start to see that come through, once travel comes back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks. Just a quick question for me on taxes. They came in a little bit higher than we had modeled. Is that attributable, once again, to geographic mix, and we should expect to see that normalize as overall trends and volumes normalize? And I guess, just a quick question there. And then, looking a little bit longer and at new products, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the Buy-Now-Pay-Later roadmap and the MCI platform? I know that earlier this quarter, you announced an agreement with Global Payments, TSYS. How should we think about the economics of that platform developing and impacting Mastercard's business overall?\nSachin Mehra: James, on taxes, -- the tax rate question which you had is being driven by a shift in the mix of our earnings, the geographical mix of our earnings. And really I've shared with you in terms of our outlook for taxes for Q4 reflects the current mix as we see it. Look, longer term, what I would tell you is, as things revert back to the mean, and I perfectly will expect that over time, things will revert back to the mean. One would expect to see that come through in the nature of our tax rate as well, as the mix starts to readjust back to what we used to see in the pre-COVID days.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. On the Buy-Now-Pay-Later space, obviously, this is -- it's a hot space. We're very active in this area. The whole range of partnerships that you recall over the last couple of quarters, Jifiti Divido, our Pine Labs investment, our Vyze acquisition and now TSYS. So, different regionally oriented ways to go to market. Afterpay, not to forget those guys. Different regional models to go to market. In terms of the economics questions that you asked related to that, it does play out in markets differently. But broadly speaking, the way we get involved in Buy-Now-and-Pay-Later not get involved to the credit side of it, but get out in -- get involved in the side of connecting merchants as well as lenders. So, here that -- you should think about that as fee-driven. We don't see the credit impact on our P&L, but it's a nice transaction business that relates -- links directly to the payment and therefore, puts us in an ideal position to benefit from that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBryan Keane: I was going to kind of ask a follow-up on that. And I understand credit's being impacted by travel. Just trying to think post pandemic, is it possible that we see credit continuing to lag versus norms because of these new models, new lines of credit like BNPL and maybe the growth in debit, the outsized growth continues, just trying to think about some of the changes post pandemic and how you guys think about that. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Well, let me start on that. First of all, picking up on Sachin's earlier comment, credit and travel, there's a high degree of correlation. As travel comes back, you'll see that reflected in credit. I think, generally, the point about us providing choice in payments to consumers is the key point. So, we'll see credit, we'll see debit, QR push payments. That's why we have a multi-rail strategy benefit from all that, regardless of what the mix is. But, I do expect credit to come back, while we saw a significant growth in debit on the shorter term. So, that\u2019d be my outlook on the short-term future.\nAjay Banga: Think about -- this is Ajay. Think about whether you say credit or a credit product or credit on a Buy-Now-Pay-Later product, it's still credit. It's pay later. They're either paying now, paying later or paying in advance, that is the third way to pay. Paying in advance is prepaid, paying now is debit or pay by account, which is again, our multi-rail approach, or credit, which is credit cards or Buy-Now-Pay-Later. We are not going to show on consumers into one place or the other. Our job is to offer choice to our partners, merchants, fintechs, banks, and then let them play the right approach with their consumer base. So, our kind of approach to this is that the need for some degree of a pay later product remains. Whether it's on one rail or the other happens to be just two options that we would offer both of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nChris Donat: I wanted to ask one follow-up question on the spending trends in your commentary about October and having one large e-commerce merchant. Do you have any thoughts on if that might be affecting -- like pulling forward some of the traditional holiday spending, or is that not really a factor? And then, also, if you could comment on how much travel might typically contribute to a fourth quarter increase relative to the third quarter in spending activity?\nMichael Miebach: All right. Chris, it's Michael here. So, let me start with that. So, when we look ahead from this October week into the rest of the year and the holiday spending season, I think, we can already tell this is going to be a holiday spending season. That's a little bit different in terms of when and how and where consumers spend. In fact, it is our view that it has actually started. So, it started earlier than what we've seen in previous years, really with that particular e-com merchant promotion. So, as we look ahead, our SpendingPulse is actually forecasting, if you take out automotive and gas, a growth in U.S. retail sales of 2.4% throughout this holiday spending season. And the categories, we talked about them earlier, where we see some that spend will go predominantly, continued trend of home furnishing, anything that happens around the kind of diameter of your home. Athleisure, clothing and electronics, that's what we expect to outperform. What will help all this is some of the shift to omnichannel on the merchant side, so we'll see the continued rise of digital. But, at the same time, wherever possible, in light of social distancing measures, we also look out for shopping local trends in your community, in your city. So, both of that will play out. But, that's our view on next months to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Michael, I know you mentioned the results of surveys you conducted on the usage of electronic payments. But, I'm curious if you have a view as to whether or not consumers are likely to travel more in 2021 versus 2020, all else equal. I know, there's a lapping effect. But, do you think that you could see a better magnitude of improvement in cross-border, all else equal, as people are getting vaccinated? And then, second question is just on the non-travel cross-border spending volume growth. Do you think you could still grow 20-plus-percent in 2021 and beyond? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Hey Sanjay. So, first -- I wish I had a crystal ball on what's going to happen. But, it is currently our view that the personal travel -- first of all, domestic, but generally, personal travel is coming back first. They want to see their families. There's like pent-up demand. You've been locked up for months. So, we do look for that, has to come back faster. And I just booked a holiday, interestingly enough, so -- and other people do the same. So that is -- it's a somewhat uninformed view. But, when you look at our mix, as Sachin earlier said, predominantly, our exposure on the travel side is towards domestic to start with and then business travel. So, we see that increasing. And it's not going to be kind of a light switch moment sometime next year. It's going to start to build out as coordination on travel corridors gets better, as testing protocols of airlines and then airports gets better. There will be these various steps that get us back to travel or return of travel with personal travel to start with. On the second part of your question, I'll hand it over to Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. So, I'll just -- one comment, Sanjay, on what Michael just said as well. As it relates to personal travel, I think it's instructive to also see what's going on in domestic travel right now. So, you are starting to see domestic travel start to return. And if you see the mix of how domestic travel returning, you're seeing personal travel come around quicker. Not to say that business travel is not coming around. We're starting to see a little bit of business travel coming on the domestic side. So, if I would extend that over to start to think about what the patterns look like on cross-border and particularly the long-haul cross-border, we expect that the pent-up demand that Michael talked about, that personal travel will come back sooner than business, but business will come back as well in cross-border. It will tie closely to the vaccines and the therapeutics. Very important for us to kind of keep line of sight on that, because at the end of the day, consumer confidence is going to be a very key determinant of how people feel about getting on planes for 12, 13, 14 hours. So, I think that's important as to how we think about this from a framework standpoint. On the second part of your question, on non-travel cross-border. Look, I mean, the secular trends are underway. You're seeing them. You\u2019re seeing the amount of digitization, which is taking place of payment flows. You're seeing the capabilities that we are building in that space to enable that secular trend and the acceleration of that secular trend. And we don't see the cross-border space as being too different in terms of how we see the e-commerce and cross-border playing out over the longer term. More and more merchants are going omnichannel, and that's really important. In the past, there were smaller merchants who felt like it was okay just to be having acceptance at the physical point of sale. They are moving more to an omnichannel environment. We're doing a bunch to enable that. We're doing a bunch on doing things from a card-on-file standpoint, tokenization, as Ajay mentioned. So, I think, those are all the things which we've got to kind of keep pushing on to capitalize on these trends from a secular standpoint. And we expect that the non-travel card-not-present component will continue to grow nicely going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask you about Central Bank backed digital currencies. And it seems like that's becoming a much more a real option that's being explored by central banks. Can you give us your thoughts about the sort of the opportunities or challenges for Mastercard when it comes to central banks kind of getting directly involved in addition on digital coins? And then, just a quick bolt-on there. Any update on Click to Pay? And apologies if you already addressed it, but just any update there in terms of how it's progressing in the context of the environment we\u2019re trying to close in? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: All right, Ramsey, Michael here. Let me take the second part of your question. First, get that out of the way. So, Click to Pay and making good progress in consumer rollout as well as in adding merchants. We're looking at 10,000 merchants here in the U.S. As far as consumer rollout goes, we talked to you in previous quarters about push provisioning through some large banks, particularly Citi here. So, this is growing at double-digit rates in terms of adding consumers. That's very, very encouraging. And what I thought is a very interesting data point. If you start to look at consumers that have used the Click to Pay experience, this is a very slick experience. We started to see that about a third of transactions is happening from returning users. So, you start to see habit building here, which is really quite encouraging. We're planning right now with some of the other EMVCo partners to look at international expansion. The plans are getting ready. Just to mention three countries that are slated for next year, ABC, Australia; you see Canada; here you see Brazil. So, some massive countries on the docket for next year. So, that's moving ahead. Central Bank Digital Currencies, big topic. Particularly in the light of COVID, you see a lot of governments that have even increased interest in modernizing their payment stack. They're looking at various tools of how to do that. Before the crisis, there was a whole range of governments looking at Central Bank Digital Currencies. And I think, with the crisis, more are even considering that as a tool. We're engaged with a very significant number of governments around the world, all regions, major regions around the world in terms of a dialogue on what is the best answer to what a government is trying to do. If you look at some of the more prominent examples that are out there, if you look at Sweden, the Riksbank, there is a thought behind the Central Bank Digital Currencies approach to deal with a world where there is no cash left. In the Bahamas, they're looking at the cost of cash. In South Africa, they're looking at financial inclusion. So, there's a whole range of different motivations. And we're trying to work with those governments to understand what those motivations might be. And Central Bank Digital Currencies is the best answer possibly. In some other instances, it might be real-time payments or it might be something else that we haven't even thought about. So, that's the first part of the dialogue. We have come to the conclusion that the construct of a central bank digital currency is an important aspect. This is in currency. [Ph] So, the Central Bank as in mining the currency is ensuring the resilience of the infrastructure. It's critical, while the private sector has a really important role to play in terms of -- has a really important role to play in terms of innovation on top of that infrastructure. You think smart contracts, you think all sorts of solutions that make the life of consumers and businesses easier. Now, why are we a relevant partner in all of this? How does this affect all of us? First of all, we have invested for years in cryptocurrency assets. We are the leading payment player when it comes to patents around crypto. So, that is -- that puts us in a good position. We have a long track record in consulting with governments. If you look at some of the more prominent examples, we are having a seat at the table to see where this goes. I'll give you one particularly important aspect of intellectual property that matters here. Once you have a Central Bank Digital Currency, it's going to make a difference to the consumer as to how you actually spend it? So, the link into an acceptance network is critical. So, we hold some patents in that space that link these transactions right back into our network where it can be used. And this is how we can bring value and it brings valueto us. So, Ramsey, a big topic. We're supportive whatever it makes sense and we're engaging governments around the world.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Michael. I see we're getting close to the top of the hour. Just to wrap up, if you have any comments?\nMichael Miebach: Well, I do have comments because it's not one call, that is a very special call here. And I'll tell you why. First of all, thanks for your questions. And before I hand it back to Ajay, I do want to acknowledge that Ajay will be taking on his new role as the Executive Chairman at the start of the next year. So, it will actually be his last earnings call as CEO. So, I want to thank Ajay for his tremendous leadership all throughout. He's making gestures right now. You should see him. I know he has built close relationships with many of you, and I look forward to doing exact and continue to provide you straightforward information about Mastercard, about our business and what we do. On a personal note to you, Ajay, I'd like to thank you for all your help during the transition period, and I look forward to continuing to work with you in our new roles. Ajay, over to you.\nAjay Banga: Thank you, Michael. And I actually was counting back during this call. And this is my 44th earnings call. And I hope you, Michael, have a similar run. I do want to thank all of you who\u2019ve been so supportive of our Company during my time over the last decade and for taking the long-term view and for trusting us to make the right investment choices to drive growth for this Company over that long term. You've seen the results. We've grown our suite of core products. We've developed world-class digital capabilities that have resulted in significant share growth over time with banks, with fintechs, with merchants. We've developed a risk set of services that both support those core payment products, they also help to diversify our revenues. And we are a true multi-rail payments provider. We have positioned ourselves for growth in new payment flows like B2B as well as in areas beyond payments such as open banking and digital identity. From '09 to 2019, revenues have grown over 3 times from $5.1 billion to $16.9 billion. Adjusted net income has grown almost 5 times from $1.5 billion to $7.9 billion. And the share price has reflected this performance, this morning's performance, notwithstanding. Michael has an awesome company with a wide area of assets and capabilities in an industry with secular tailwinds. Yes, we have to continue to execute while investing for the next decade. And I have no doubt, challenges will lie ahead, like the pandemic that is still with us, economic and societal challenges, as well as nationalistic tendencies. But, I also have no doubt whatsoever, in Michael's skills as a leader and in the quality of the wonderful people in this Company, as we look ahead. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajay Banga",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. We are now a few quarters into the pandemic. And while individuals and businesses and society at large continue to face many challenges, we are also seeing some positive trends, both in terms of the trajectory of spending and the acceleration of digital payments that we are helping enable. For example, our SpendingPulse estimates for quarter three show U.S. retail sales up 1.8% versus a year ago, ex-auto, ex-gas. We've also seen positive numbers in countries like the United Kingdom. Looking at the trends, volumes improved throughout the third quarter. In fact, if you exclude travel and entertainment, which has been particularly hard hit, our switched volume growth rates in September were similar to what we saw before the pandemic in Q4 of 2019. Using our four-phased framework, we have seen markets go through the containment and stabilization phases, and now we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. And so, consistent with this, we have seen our revenue going in the right direction this quarter as year-over-year currency-neutral growth was 3 percentage points better than last quarter, and the domestic spending trends so far in October continue to remain steady. Now, we have seen some improvement in domestic travels in the quarter, including spending in categories such as lodging and restaurants. Cross-border travel, however, remains constrained. And while we have seen some improvement in travel within the EU during the quarter, cross-border travel outside the EU has shown only limited recovery. We believe travel improve and consumer confidence recovers as a result of improved testing and safety protocols being put in place, medical advances occurring and as border restrictions are lifted, and there is increased international coordination of travel cross-borders. When cross-border travel does improve, we will be very well-positioned to capitalize on that recovery. So, overall, we see signs of improvement. But, we're not out of the woods yet, as we are seeing in places like Europe restriction being put back in place. As we said in the past, progress through the phases may not be linear. It's going to take some time. And it will be positively impacted by the broad availability of successful therapeutics and vaccines. During this time, we remain focused on the things we can control, continue to execute against our strategy, invest in our business for the longer term and manage our expenses in a disciplined way. Our digital technologies help us drive the secular shift to electronic forms of payment that support our broad range of customers, banks, fintechs, neobanks and merchants. We are growing our core payment capabilities in credit, debit, prepaid and commercial with new and renewed deals. Our services, which are helping our customers and consumers adapt to the changing environment are continuing to grow well, and they provide meaningful differentiation and revenue diversification. And our multi-rail capabilities are providing choice to customers and consumers by addressing a wide range of payment flows. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Hey Lisa, it's Ajay. And I'm going to kick it off, and I'm going to let Michael. He is the European export. First, tokenization to us is building the foundation for safe, secure and frictionless online contactless kind of commerce. But, think of tokenization as being extendable also to card-present transactions eventually. So that wherever card data exchanges hand in any form, the actual data that exchanges hands is not the data that can be reused without unlocking cryptocurrency. That's the objective. Then also, therefore, provides us with a terrific rail to see more transactions than we used to in the past, which by the way is one of the reasons why our transaction percentage, as we see, is growing up from -- over the last decade from 40-something percent to 55-plus percent today. And that enables our data and services business to power itself on a higher level of growth. That's the logic of tokenization. That's the investment in it. The fact that it's now 8%, which is kind of doubling over last year in terms of number of transactions, you should view that as a continuing trend that we are going to push as hard as we can with every ounce of energy in our selling system. That's the first part of the answer. Does it connect to Europe? Yes, not yet any differently from others because secure customer authentication, SCA, is still not fully implemented, as you know, in Europe because there was an extension granted on how well that will go through. Will that be very much helped by tokenization? Yes, but not yet in those numbers. So, what you're seeing is really efforts across the board, across markets, across geographies for us to build a foundation for this very simple smart commerce of the future. And by the way, Lisa, this is useful for merchants, as Michael said. It's useful for fintech. It's useful for banks. It's useful from a point of view of governments, because it adds the security in the system. This is a good thing. And it's standardized across the industry, which makes it get to scale. The only thing I'll add to that -- this is Ajay, is that the services in other revenue is a number of different businesses. It's not one thing. So, there's data analytics, there's loyalty, there's cybersecurity. So, it can create some lumpiness across quarters. But, those -- when we started out 10 years ago, that was 4%, 5% of our revenue. It is currently running -- Sachin, at what level? Somewhere between 25% and 30% of our revenue, depending on the quarter. So, you can imagine the focus that Michael and team are putting into it, you should expect to see more activity in that space in data analytics, in AI, in cybersecurity. You should expect Michael to be continually driving new differentiation there. Think about -- this is Ajay. Think about whether you say credit or a credit product or credit on a Buy-Now-Pay-Later product, it's still credit. It's pay later. They're either paying now, paying later or paying in advance, that is the third way to pay. Paying in advance is prepaid, paying now is debit or pay by account, which is again, our multi-rail approach, or credit, which is credit cards or Buy-Now-Pay-Later. We are not going to show on consumers into one place or the other. Our job is to offer choice to our partners, merchants, fintechs, banks, and then let them play the right approach with their consumer base. So, our kind of approach to this is that the need for some degree of a pay later product remains. Whether it's on one rail or the other happens to be just two options that we would offer both of. Thank you, Michael. And I actually was counting back during this call. And this is my 44th earnings call. And I hope you, Michael, have a similar run. I do want to thank all of you who've been so supportive of our Company during my time over the last decade and for taking the long-term view and for trusting us to make the right investment choices to drive growth for this Company over that long term. You've seen the results. We've grown our suite of core products. We've developed world-class digital capabilities that have resulted in significant share growth over time with banks, with fintechs, with merchants. We've developed a risk set of services that both support those core payment products, they also help to diversify our revenues. And we are a true multi-rail payments provider. We have positioned ourselves for growth in new payment flows like B2B as well as in areas beyond payments such as open banking and digital identity. From '09 to 2019, revenues have grown over 3 times from $5.1 billion to $16.9 billion. Adjusted net income has grown almost 5 times from $1.5 billion to $7.9 billion. And the share price has reflected this performance, this morning's performance, notwithstanding. Michael has an awesome company with a wide area of assets and capabilities in an industry with secular tailwinds. Yes, we have to continue to execute while investing for the next decade. And I have no doubt, challenges will lie ahead, like the pandemic that is still with us, economic and societal challenges, as well as nationalistic tendencies. But, I also have no doubt whatsoever, in Michael's skills as a leader and in the quality of the wonderful people in this Company, as we look ahead. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. So, turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impact of gains and losses on the Company's equity investments. Net revenue was down 14%, reflecting the impacts of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were down 5% year-over-year or down 8%, if you exclude the 3 ppt impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 20% and net income was down 26%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was down 25% year-over-year to $1.60, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $2.1 billion worth of stock and an additional $392 million through October 23, 2020. So, let's turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 1% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the effects of the pandemic. U.S. GDV increased by 4% with debit growth of 20%, partially offset by a credit decline of 12%. Outside of the U.S., volume was flat. Cross-border volume was down 36% globally for the quarter. As we have previously mentioned, the pace of recovery in lower yielding intra-Europe volumes is stronger than other cross-border, which is higher yielding. Specifically, intra-Europe volume was down 23%, whereas other cross-border volume was down 49% as border restrictions were eased in Europe in advance of other locations. Turning to page 5. Switched transactions showed growth of 5% in the third quarter globally. We saw positive growth in switched transactions across most regions, aided in part by the continued adoption of contactless that Michael mentioned earlier. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.7 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 14% was primarily driven by a decline in cross-border volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by growth in GDV switched transactions and continued growth in services. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth. As a reminder, the transaction with Nets did not close this quarter, as previously expected. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 5%, while worldwide GDV grew 1%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Cross-border volume fees decreased 48%, while cross-border volume decreased 36%. The 12 ppt difference is due to adverse cross-border mix, mainly driven by a slower recovery in non-intra-Europe cross-border volumes that are high yielding than intra-Europe cross-border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 1%, while switched transactions were up 5%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by the adverse cross-border mix I just mentioned. Other revenues were up 6%, including a 2 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data and Services solutions. Also, just as a reminder, growth in other revenues was impacted by a difficult year-ago comp. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 2%. Moving on to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses decreased 5%. This includes a 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions, which was lower than expected, primarily due to a delay in the closing of the transaction with Nets. Excluding acquisitions, expenses decreased 8%, which was also better than expectations, primarily related to actions taken to reduce advertising and marketing, travel, personnel costs and professional fee-related expenses. Turning to page 8. Let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. One point to note, while the week ending October 21st shows higher growth metrics relative to the prior week, this is being primarily driven by the timing of significant promotional activity by an e-com merchant and their competitors. Through the first three weeks of October, each of the metrics are in line with recent trends, adjusting for this e-com promotional activity. Commenting on the specific metrics, starting with switched volumes, we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically with some approaching growth. When you look at how people are spending, card-present growth rates remain steady, with strength in retail categories such as groceries, offset by some declines in T&E. Card-not-present growth rates remain healthy. Trends in switched transactions remain steady, benefiting from increased contactless penetration. In terms of cross-border, intra-Europe continues to outpace other cross-border volumes. As previously mentioned, intra-Europe yields are lower than those of other cross-border volumes. So now turning to page 9, I'd like to provide you additional color on the cross-border trends across card-present and card-not-present. You can see the trends that we laid out through the course of the quarter continue. The e-com promotional activity I referenced also impacted cross-border growth for the week ending October 21st. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border continues in a similar band. If you look at the orange line, card-present spend has declined slightly, following an uptick in travel over the summer holiday season. Card-not-present growth, which is the yellow line on the chart, continues to be resilient and has held up well. The green line represents card-not-present excluding online travel-related spend and remains positive. We continue to see strong growth across retail categories, particularly in discretionary areas like clothing and home improvement as well as in nondiscretionary categories such as groceries. This line was particularly impacted by the e-com promotional activity. One final point regarding all metrics. Given the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, we are closely monitoring the impact on spending of additional mitigation measures that are being put in place, particularly in Europe. Turning to page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on the upcoming quarter. As we previously established, given the ongoing uncertainty, we will not be providing a forward view for net revenues at this time. We do intend, however, to continue to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics to help you understand the trends we are seeing. First, I'd like to make a few comments on how I see our business shaping up in light of the pandemic. The story in non-T&E domestic volumes is quite encouraging. Specifically, as Ajay mentioned, we are seeing volume growth rates ex-T&E in September, similar to what we were seeing pre-COVID in Q4 2019. The impact of the pandemic on travel and, in particular, on non-intra-Europe cross-border travel, remain significant. While we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel, and we believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year. As a reminder, we will see improved growth rates due to lapping the effects of the pandemic before that, starting in late March next year. All of this being said, we have always been well-positioned in the cross-border travel space, and we continue to build on this position of strength through various initiatives with existing and new partners, as Michael commented on. This will enable us to capitalize on the recovery in cross-border when it does occur. With that as background, I'd like to make a couple of comments to help you with your modeling of revenues for the quarter. First, as you have seen, non-intra-Europe cross-border travel has seen minimal recovery since the onset of pandemic. Given that these volumes are significantly higher yielding than intra-Europe cross-border, this has resulted in a slower recovery in our cross-border revenues. As a reminder, this negative mix impacts both our cross-border volume fees and transaction processing fees, as you have seen in Q3. This will continue to be a factor, so long as this mix persists. Secondly, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to increase by 2 to 3 ppt sequentially, reflecting normal seasonal trends and increased deal activity, as Michael mentioned. Now let's turn to operating expenses. Consistent with our four-phased framework, we're managing through the pandemic and given that we are in the normalization phase, we continue to carefully manage our priorities in order to preserve our ability to invest in our key long-term growth drivers, digital, cyber, data and analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. For Q4, we expect operating expenses to be down low single digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our continued focus on expense management as well as sequentially higher advertising and marketing spend related to promotional campaigns. With respect to M&A, we are pleased with the progress we have made toward securing regulatory approval for the transaction with Nets and now expect that transaction to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on this timing and the planned closing of the Finicity acquisition this quarter, we expect acquisitions to contribute 0.5 ppt to revenue and approximately 4 to 5 ppt to operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Other items to keep in mind for Q4. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind to revenues and a 0 to 1 ppt headwind to operating expenses. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20% for the quarter, based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Hey Craig, it's Sachin. So, let me take that one. I think, the thing to actually focus on is the following. When you think about cross-border, you think about intra-Europe cross-border and non-intra-Europe cross-border. But, the other dimension you should think about is personal travel relative to business travel. And, I think, what you should -- our expectation in terms of how we think things will evolve is going to be tied to the availability of vaccines and therapeutics. Our view is personal travel comes back quicker than business travel does. Personal travel for Mastercard represents a substantial portion of our total cross-border. So, the way I would think about that is to think about in the context of, as travel starts to come back, we'll see personal travel, which is a substantial portion of our total cross-border come back sooner than business travel. And that should be tied to how we see the evolution of the COVID vaccine and the therapeutics taking place. That's the way I would think about it. Look, I mean, here is what I tell you, in terms of the opportunity for yields on card-present versus card-not-present is the way you should think about it, generally, at the baseline, the yields are pretty consistent. Clearly, when you have card-not-present transactions, you have the opportunity to leverage the strong capabilities we at Mastercard have from a services standpoint, such as our fraud and analytics capabilities, which when layered on and are more relevant in the card-not-present environment, cause for the yields to be higher in card-not-present over card-present. Sure. So Darren, so in other revenue, as we kind of previously discussed, it's got -- a large part of our services revenue sits there. There are several other revenue items related to acquisitions, which we've done in the services area, which kind of again sit in that. So, there's a bunch of stuff which goes in the other revenue line item. I think the way you should think about it is the following. Our services capabilities and the revenue we generate from our services capabilities continue to be in great demand in the marketplace and they're growing well. Bottom line, point number one, really important for us to get out there, because there is a lot of demand coming from our customers on that. What you are seeing in terms of other revenue growth in Q3 is -- and the reason it's -- we grew at 6% ex acquisitions that grew at about 4%. We had a tough year-over-year comp. Last year, that other revenue line item was growing at 30% ex acquisitions. And so, look, at the end of the day, last year the growth rate we had was driven by some really strong demand in the third quarter for our consulting capabilities, which came through there. And really, what I would say is longer term, the way you should think about services in general and other revenue as well is they continue to grow faster than the core. They're in good demand in the marketplace, including those which we've developed organically, as well as the acquisitions we've done, including things like Ethoca, RiskRecon, all of which, candidly in the current prevailing environment with increased digitalization are even in more demand. So, that's the way I think about it. So, it's north of 25%... Hi Jason, it's Sachin. On transaction processing fees and the delta between transaction processing fees and the growth in switched transactions, it is primarily being driven by the adverse cross-border mix. As you know, there is a component of our cross-border revenues which come in transaction processing fees. And when the proportionate share of intra-Europe versus non-intra-Europe is tilting towards in favor of intra-Europe transactions, it has the adverse impact, which is what you're seeing come through there. And in Q3, that's exactly what's kind of driving that delta. On your second question on performance of credit, we do have actually seen an improvement in credit performance quarter-over-quarter, much in line with what you're learning from the issuer side. In fact, I would say, across all regions, there has been good improvement in our volume metrics. And the reality is, as we are starting to see strength come through relative to the second quarter in terms of domestic volumes and transactions, that's manifesting itself in the debit improvements we've seen as well as on the credit side. So, it's very consistent with what we're hearing fromthe issuance. Hi. Tien-tsin. So, the color, which in addition to the commentary, which we've just shared around yields in general as well as the mix shift, which is taking place between intra-Europe cross-border and non-intra-Europe cross-border is, travel, by and large happens to be more credit-oriented. And recovery of travel ties closely to how the metrics show up on credit as well. And so, the only point I can make is that as we start to see travel come back, which we very well expect to come back, and like I said, personal travel probably before business travel. I think, from a product standpoint, what you can expect to see is that the credit volumes start to come back in a more meaningful manner, just because that's the more prominent product to use there. The other piece is certainly prepaid as well in the travel business. As you know, we've got a bunch of prepaid products, which are very focused on travel-oriented business. And that too we'll start to see that come through, once travel comes back. James, on taxes, -- the tax rate question which you had is being driven by a shift in the mix of our earnings, the geographical mix of our earnings. And really I've shared with you in terms of our outlook for taxes for Q4 reflects the current mix as we see it. Look, longer term, what I would tell you is, as things revert back to the mean, and I perfectly will expect that over time, things will revert back to the mean. One would expect to see that come through in the nature of our tax rate as well, as the mix starts to readjust back to what we used to see in the pre-COVID days. Yes. So, I'll just -- one comment, Sanjay, on what Michael just said as well. As it relates to personal travel, I think it's instructive to also see what's going on in domestic travel right now. So, you are starting to see domestic travel start to return. And if you see the mix of how domestic travel returning, you're seeing personal travel come around quicker. Not to say that business travel is not coming around. We're starting to see a little bit of business travel coming on the domestic side. So, if I would extend that over to start to think about what the patterns look like on cross-border and particularly the long-haul cross-border, we expect that the pent-up demand that Michael talked about, that personal travel will come back sooner than business, but business will come back as well in cross-border. It will tie closely to the vaccines and the therapeutics. Very important for us to kind of keep line of sight on that, because at the end of the day, consumer confidence is going to be a very key determinant of how people feel about getting on planes for 12, 13, 14 hours. So, I think that's important as to how we think about this from a framework standpoint. On the second part of your question, on non-travel cross-border. Look, I mean, the secular trends are underway. You're seeing them. You're seeing the amount of digitization, which is taking place of payment flows. You're seeing the capabilities that we are building in that space to enable that secular trend and the acceleration of that secular trend. And we don't see the cross-border space as being too different in terms of how we see the e-commerce and cross-border playing out over the longer term. More and more merchants are going omnichannel, and that's really important. In the past, there were smaller merchants who felt like it was okay just to be having acceptance at the physical point of sale. They are moving more to an omnichannel environment. We're doing a bunch to enable that. We're doing a bunch on doing things from a card-on-file standpoint, tokenization, as Ajay mentioned. So, I think, those are all the things which we've got to kind of keep pushing on to capitalize on these trends from a secular standpoint. And we expect that the non-travel card-not-present component will continue to grow nicely going forward."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thanks, Ajay. Picking up where Ajay left off, we're positioning ourselves for the future by driving this accelerated shift towards electronic payments. According to our research, almost 7 in 10 people globally say the shift will likely be permanent. We believe that as the economies reopen, people will shop in stores again. But, e-commerce will remain elevated from pre-pandemic levels as behaviors have changed and payment preferences have shifted. Our research also shows that about 60% of consumers plan to use less cash, even after the pandemic subsides. As a result, merchants are becoming more digital and consumers and businesses are adapting how they interact at the point of sale, both in-person and online. Regardless of how these trends play out, our solutions are available to support consumers, issuers and merchants. The debt preferences and needs evolve, be it in store or online. And we are partnering with digital enablers to bring our digital solutions to market at speed and at scale. Let me give you some examples. First, consumers. Consumers want choice. Whether they want to pay using contactless, card-on-file, QR or via installments, we are enabling that choice. Contactless growth continues to be fueled by increasing consumer adoption. In the third quarter, contactless penetration represented 41% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 37% in the second quarter and 30% a year ago. At the same time, we are enabling a safe and simplified experience for consumers across digital channels with our tokenization capabilities. This foundational technology is growing rapidly with the number of tokenized transactions doubling year-over-year in the third quarter, now accounting for 8% of our switched transactions. We're also enabling more consumers to participate in digital commerce. For example, Santander Chile has rolled out digital debit Mastercard to all of their Maestro card holders. This quarter alone, we won deals that will lead to about 10 million Maestro cards being migrated to Debit Mastercard in the near future. Second, let's talk about issuance. We have a set of digitally enabled products and solutions that drive this accelerated secular shift, including digital-first solutions tailored to fintechs and neobanks, and issuing plans with which we have an established leadership position. We're partnering with large global players like PayPal, as we make the PayPal business Debit Mastercard available to businesses in five new markets in Europe, in addition to its current availability in the U.S., the UK and Germany. We've extended our deals neobank, one of the world's largest neobanks, and will maintain a leadership position with them in Brazil as one of the new markets as they expand their operations in Mexico and Colombia. Mastercard also helps fintechs build and scale their businesses. We've signed several deals with fast-growing neobanks around the world, like Nickel in France and Bnext in Spain. Third, we're focused on helping merchants, merchants as they shift to digital and develop omnichannel capabilities. For instance, we launched a POS capability in India with Worldline and Axis Bank that transforms smartphones into point-of-sale terminals with the ability to accept contactless QR and remote payments. In the buy now, pay later space, in addition to our previous partner announcements, we recently announced the partnership with TSYS to deliver installment capabilities to issuers. In addition, we're also piloting simplified shopping experiences using AI and computer vision, such as enhanced drive-thrus at White Castle and Sonic, and checkout-free pilots at Dunkin' and Circle K. And finally, we're partnering with digital enablers to bring our digital solutions to market. We just announced an expanded partnership with Marqeta, a digital processor, to introduce new products and launch additional card programs in new geographies. And talking about geographies, in Africa, we have partnered with Samsung, Airtel Africa and Asante to enable access to digital financing to consumers, entrepreneurs and merchants. In parallel, we're driving hard-to-grow our core products, leveraging these differentiated digital capabilities to set ourselves up well for the future. In the U.S., we are excited about our partnership with Chase to launch the new Freedom Flex Mastercard, offering card members cash back on everyday spend as well as our leading world of these benefits. We also expanded our relationship with Barclays Bank U.S., which will now include new products and services in addition to their consumer and small business credit portfolios. In Europe, we continue to strengthen our position. We signed a regional agreement with the Santander Group for their card business, securing a long-term partnership. We're also extending our relationship with ING, as they grow internationally. And we've agreed to a long-term renewal with Swedbank, our largest customer in the Nordics and Baltics, which will become an exclusive Mastercard customer. On the co-brand front, in the U.S., the Wayfair Mastercard with Citi has launched. And, we will be the new exclusive network for the AARP Credit co-brand program. In Canada, we have extended our co-brand relationship with Walmart. And we're happy that Taobao just launched its Mastercard co-brand issued by Bank of China in Hong Kong and Macau. We're also focused on positioning ourselves for the return of travel. This includes partnerships with Emirates Skywards on their first co-brand credit card in the U.S. and a renewal of our exclusive co-brand agreement with Miles & More, the largest traveler loyalty program in Europe on their German portfolio. It also includes a focus on travel-oriented portfolios like WEX that you've heard us talk about over the last several quarters. We're also working hard to improve cross-border approval rates and optimize portfolios now with Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Analytics Services. Now, speaking of services, it is important to note that our services have played a critical role enabling the wins I just mentioned. For example, our renewal and extension with ING will include our data analytics and data insights services. Services are a material driver of our revenue growth and a source of diversification while we help our customers adapt quickly and securely as they navigate through the pandemic into a rapidly digitizing world. One way we're helping our customers is through our cyber services and the use of artificial intelligence, an area we have been investing in both organically and inorganically. We have developed a broad set of scalable AI capabilities, which have been integrated into our network, our products and services. And here are some examples. Citibank is assessing our AI platform to determine enhanced capabilities to mitigate credit losses. And Itau\u0301 and Santander Mexico are using our AI to provide added security for consumers while ensuring good transactions are approved. And with that, let's turn to the account to account space, where we believe there are significant incremental flows to address. For the last several years, we've developed a set of assets to comprehensively address these opportunities at the infrastructure, applications and services layers. We believe this combination allows us to best address the broad range of customer needs. At the infrastructure level, we continue to make good progress with our build-outs and have a strong position in all major geographic regions, including key markets like the U.S., the UK, Nordics and Saudi Arabia. Building off our strong position in infrastructure, we're also making good progress in the application layer, utilizing our multi-rail capabilities. Starting on the consumer-to-merchant front. The Pay by Bank app in the UK, which extends our ability to compete for everyday spend along with our debit products, is growing both in consumer accounts and merchant acceptance. With Barclays set to launch with their 9 million mobile banking app customers before the end of the year, together with their customers already onboarded by HSBC, we will have around a third of the UK mobile banking customers enabled. We have streamlined our merchant onboarding process and currently have more than 700 merchants signed up, such as the WHSmith Group. At our distribution partners like Workday and others, we are well positioned to expand acceptance even further. In the bill pay space, several new partners will be supporting the Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange, including FIS, Wescom Credit Union, Payrailz and MoCaFi on the consumer side and COBRA, PNC Bank and CSG on the biller side. Bill Pay Exchange will now have access to approximately a third of bills paid annually in the U.S. and be able to reach about a quarter of active U.S. Bill Pay consumers. In the B2B, we continue to develop the ecosystem around Mastercard Track Business Payment Service with Fiserv now live on the platform. We are also excited to announce an expansion of our longstanding strategic relationship with PayPal, who can now use Mastercard Send to power fund transfers to consumers and small businesses through all their brands, including Braintree, Zoom, Hyperwallet and iZettle. And finally, we are continuing to make progress in the services layer, including consulting, fraud prevention and a recent extension in the UK for our trace anti-money laundering services. In summary, we're managing our business through this normalization phase with agility, winning share and have good deal momentum. We're driving the accelerated shift towards digital payments, and our clients see us differentiating ourselves with our services. We see domestic volumes rebound and are positioning ourselves well for the medium to long-term growth opportunity, including the return of travel through continued investment in our strategic priorities. With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Despite the fact that Ajay isn't European, I think, he told the European story. The only thing I would add is, as we did the foundational work over the last two, three years around tokenization, particularly the merchant tokenization, our MPRM [ph] product, we've made the implementation so much easier. We're talking about a very light lift for merchants, which is driving some of this acceleration here. Hey Bob, Michael here. So, we're actively engaging on the two that you mentioned. That's Nets and that's Fincity. As Sachin pointed out earlier, we are confident that Nets will close into the first quarter. We're very happy that we get the intrinsical approval from the EU Commission there. We're working through the remedy. So, that is a process that's well-understood and on track for us. So, a high level of confidence there. When it comes to Finicity, we continue to be quite optimistic as we work this through and it will close in the fourth quarter. Now, the level of oversight and engagement around antitrust topics, we're obviously aware of that. And we're following a news as everybody else does. Now, when we look at Finicity where the confidence that I've just talked about there really relates to why we like Finicity. We like Finicity because they have really strong data management practices. We like them because they have in a light of day set of relationships with banks and with fintechs on both sides, so very transparent business model. We like them particularly because of the approach that they took to create a world of open banking that really favors the consumer to use their data with their consent and only with their consent. They created the financial data exchange around it, which is now the emerging standard globally on how to do open banking in a proper way. So, we feel really quite good about that. Other acquisitions, as they come, we'll continue to work that within the respective regulatory environment. So, not any change to our M&A strategy. Yes. On the Buy-Now-Pay-Later space, obviously, this is -- it's a hot space. We're very active in this area. The whole range of partnerships that you recall over the last couple of quarters, Jifiti Divido, our Pine Labs investment, our Vyze acquisition and now TSYS. So, different regionally oriented ways to go to market. Afterpay, not to forget those guys. Different regional models to go to market. In terms of the economics questions that you asked related to that, it does play out in markets differently. But broadly speaking, the way we get involved in Buy-Now-and-Pay-Later not get involved to the credit side of it, but get out in -- get involved in the side of connecting merchants as well as lenders. So, here that -- you should think about that as fee-driven. We don't see the credit impact on our P&L, but it's a nice transaction business that relates -- links directly to the payment and therefore, puts us in an ideal position to benefit from that. Well, let me start on that. First of all, picking up on Sachin's earlier comment, credit and travel, there's a high degree of correlation. As travel comes back, you'll see that reflected in credit. I think, generally, the point about us providing choice in payments to consumers is the key point. So, we'll see credit, we'll see debit, QR push payments. That's why we have a multi-rail strategy benefit from all that, regardless of what the mix is. But, I do expect credit to come back, while we saw a significant growth in debit on the shorter term. So, that'd be my outlook on the short-term future. All right. Chris, it's Michael here. So, let me start with that. So, when we look ahead from this October week into the rest of the year and the holiday spending season, I think, we can already tell this is going to be a holiday spending season. That's a little bit different in terms of when and how and where consumers spend. In fact, it is our view that it has actually started. So, it started earlier than what we've seen in previous years, really with that particular e-com merchant promotion. So, as we look ahead, our SpendingPulse is actually forecasting, if you take out automotive and gas, a growth in U.S. retail sales of 2.4% throughout this holiday spending season. And the categories, we talked about them earlier, where we see some that spend will go predominantly, continued trend of home furnishing, anything that happens around the kind of diameter of your home. Athleisure, clothing and electronics, that's what we expect to outperform. What will help all this is some of the shift to omnichannel on the merchant side, so we'll see the continued rise of digital. But, at the same time, wherever possible, in light of social distancing measures, we also look out for shopping local trends in your community, in your city. So, both of that will play out. But, that's our view on next months to come. Hey Sanjay. So, first -- I wish I had a crystal ball on what's going to happen. But, it is currently our view that the personal travel -- first of all, domestic, but generally, personal travel is coming back first. They want to see their families. There's like pent-up demand. You've been locked up for months. So, we do look for that, has to come back faster. And I just booked a holiday, interestingly enough, so -- and other people do the same. So that is -- it's a somewhat uninformed view. But, when you look at our mix, as Sachin earlier said, predominantly, our exposure on the travel side is towards domestic to start with and then business travel. So, we see that increasing. And it's not going to be kind of a light switch moment sometime next year. It's going to start to build out as coordination on travel corridors gets better, as testing protocols of airlines and then airports gets better. There will be these various steps that get us back to travel or return of travel with personal travel to start with. On the second part of your question, I'll hand it over to Sachin. All right, Ramsey, Michael here. Let me take the second part of your question. First, get that out of the way. So, Click to Pay and making good progress in consumer rollout as well as in adding merchants. We're looking at 10,000 merchants here in the U.S. As far as consumer rollout goes, we talked to you in previous quarters about push provisioning through some large banks, particularly Citi here. So, this is growing at double-digit rates in terms of adding consumers. That's very, very encouraging. And what I thought is a very interesting data point. If you start to look at consumers that have used the Click to Pay experience, this is a very slick experience. We started to see that about a third of transactions is happening from returning users. So, you start to see habit building here, which is really quite encouraging. We're planning right now with some of the other EMVCo partners to look at international expansion. The plans are getting ready. Just to mention three countries that are slated for next year, ABC, Australia; you see Canada; here you see Brazil. So, some massive countries on the docket for next year. So, that's moving ahead. Central Bank Digital Currencies, big topic. Particularly in the light of COVID, you see a lot of governments that have even increased interest in modernizing their payment stack. They're looking at various tools of how to do that. Before the crisis, there was a whole range of governments looking at Central Bank Digital Currencies. And I think, with the crisis, more are even considering that as a tool. We're engaged with a very significant number of governments around the world, all regions, major regions around the world in terms of a dialogue on what is the best answer to what a government is trying to do. If you look at some of the more prominent examples that are out there, if you look at Sweden, the Riksbank, there is a thought behind the Central Bank Digital Currencies approach to deal with a world where there is no cash left. In the Bahamas, they're looking at the cost of cash. In South Africa, they're looking at financial inclusion. So, there's a whole range of different motivations. And we're trying to work with those governments to understand what those motivations might be. And Central Bank Digital Currencies is the best answer possibly. In some other instances, it might be real-time payments or it might be something else that we haven't even thought about. So, that's the first part of the dialogue. We have come to the conclusion that the construct of a central bank digital currency is an important aspect. This is in currency. [Ph] So, the Central Bank as in mining the currency is ensuring the resilience of the infrastructure. It's critical, while the private sector has a really important role to play in terms of -- has a really important role to play in terms of innovation on top of that infrastructure. You think smart contracts, you think all sorts of solutions that make the life of consumers and businesses easier. Now, why are we a relevant partner in all of this? How does this affect all of us? First of all, we have invested for years in cryptocurrency assets. We are the leading payment player when it comes to patents around crypto. So, that is -- that puts us in a good position. We have a long track record in consulting with governments. If you look at some of the more prominent examples, we are having a seat at the table to see where this goes. I'll give you one particularly important aspect of intellectual property that matters here. Once you have a Central Bank Digital Currency, it's going to make a difference to the consumer as to how you actually spend it? So, the link into an acceptance network is critical. So, we hold some patents in that space that link these transactions right back into our network where it can be used. And this is how we can bring value and it brings valueto us. So, Ramsey, a big topic. We're supportive whatever it makes sense and we're engaging governments around the world. Well, I do have comments because it's not one call, that is a very special call here. And I'll tell you why. First of all, thanks for your questions. And before I hand it back to Ajay, I do want to acknowledge that Ajay will be taking on his new role as the Executive Chairman at the start of the next year. So, it will actually be his last earnings call as CEO. So, I want to thank Ajay for his tremendous leadership all throughout. He's making gestures right now. You should see him. I know he has built close relationships with many of you, and I look forward to doing exact and continue to provide you straightforward information about Mastercard, about our business and what we do. On a personal note to you, Ajay, I'd like to thank you for all your help during the transition period, and I look forward to continuing to work with you in our new roles. Ajay, over to you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Warren Kneeshaw, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Casey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for second quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you are all safe and sound. With me today are Ajay Banga, our Chief Executive Officer; Michael Miebach, our President; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay, Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted but the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.\nAjay Banga: Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody. So over the past several months, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of our society, and we remain focused on supporting our employees, our issuers, merchants, small businesses and government partners to help them navigate through what I think are completely unprecedented times. You may recall that we introduced a four-phase framework for monitoring spending levels and how we would run our company on our last earnings call: Containment, stabilization, normalization and growth. Now in the second quarter, we saw a progressive improvement in volume trends over the course for quarter, driven by the opening up of domestic economies. And today, we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically, where truly occurs and social distancing and mobility limitations are relaxed and spending begins to gradually recover with some sectors recovering faster than others. We expect that progressing through the normalization phase and ultimately moving to the growth phase, essentially, bringing us back to pre-COVID days is very much dependent upon turning the tide on infection, which you\u2019ve seen in Europe, in Asia and the United States Northeast, but also is ultimately tied to the broad availability of a vaccine and proven therapeutics. We expect that the progress through the phases will be non-linear. We have seen that in places like Japan and potentially in the Southern United States, where we are monitoring for the effects of the reintroduction of social distancing restrictions. Meanwhile, the world is becoming more digital. Our services are in strong demand, and we expect that travel will begin to come back as borders reopen, the first signs of which we are beginning to see in Europe. The COVID crisis has driven an acceleration in the use of electronic forms of payment with much greater adoption of digital and contactless solutions. Now we believe those would sustain beyond the pandemic, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on those. The pandemic has also highlighted the resiliency of our differentiated business model, which is reflected in our financial performance. Our services growth remains strong. It\u2019s outpacing the goal and it drives meaningful differentiation and diversification. Our digital and multi-rail solutions are enabling us to address key opportunities by providing customer choice and the capabilities required to capture a wide range of payment flows. And we continue to win deals across all our core products. So we are focused on what we can control. We are focused on executing against our strategy. We are focused on managing the business for the long-term and we are focused on investing in key strategic priorities, in areas like open banking, real-time payments, Cyber and Intelligence Solutions and B2B themes. Now you\u2019re going to hear lots of that from Michael. And before I hand it over to him, I\u2019d like to share a few comments on diversity and inclusion. Through the events we have watched unfold in the United States and elsewhere over the last several weeks, our society is facing the difficult truth that there is a long way to go to ensure that the fundamental human rights of all people are equally respected. There is no place for racism or discrimination in our communities, in our company, in our hearts. For years, we here in Mastercard have championed inclusion. We have focused on issues that matter to the black community as well as to others, including delivering on our commitment to bring 500 million individuals into the financial system. We\u2019ve extended that pledge, as you know, to 1 billion people by 2025, including 50 million micro and small businesses and 25 million women entrepreneurs. We are long-standing partners of several, several rights organizations and we have closed the racial pay gap over the years. In 2019, Mastercard employees in the United States, who are people of color, have paid the same as Caucasian employees. So we are proud of where we are, but we recognize how much more there is still to do. And to that end, we have launched a companywide, long-term initiative to drive change for our people, for the market we work in and for society at large, including bolstering black recruitment and training, driving financial inclusion and addressing the wealth and opportunity gap faced by black communities. We must and we will capitalize on this opportunity to effect change. So now over to Michael.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Ajay. As Ajay mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a series of significant behavioral changes across consumers, merchants and businesses to having a profound impact on payment preferences, many of which are likely to persist beyond COVID. Key trends include a preference for contactless, the rapid adoption of e-commerce and increased aversion to cash, a merchant requirement to omni-channel acceptance and a need to automate B2B payments. Each of these provide an opportunity for our business to accelerate the secular shift to digital forms of payment. Let me give you some examples. So let\u2019s start with the consumer. According to our latest COVID-19 consumer impact study, over 70% of consumers plan to continue or increase their online purchasing and approximately 60% believe they will use less cash even after the pandemic subsides. And we are providing digital-first solutions that leverage our tokenization and other digital technologies to meet these changing needs. In addition to the success we\u2019ve had in the digital space with companies like Apple, we recently announced an expanded partnership with Samsung, which includes the digital-first Samsung Money by SoFi product here in the U.S. and the Samsung Pay card with Curve in the UK Southeast Asian super app Grab has launched a digital-first Mastercard prepaid card in the Philippines and the partnering with emerging fintechs like C24 in Germany, for the Mastercard debit solution and tied in the UK to provide a new commercial prepaid product. In addition, click to pay, the streamline industry-wide guest checkout capability continues to gain momentum as consumers shift to digital experiences. More than 10,000 merchants have been enabled in the U.S. and preparations for global expansion are underway. We are differentiating our click to pay offering through an additional layer of security enabled by new data, AI and machine learning technology and through push provisioning of consumer enrollment through banks like Citi, which will help to speed up and ease consumer adoption. Another implication of the shift to e-commerce is the need to support merchants with digital-enablement solutions. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent about 90% of businesses worldwide, have an acute need in this area as they recover from the impact of pandemic. As part of our $250 million commitment to support small business globally, we have recently launched our Digital Doors initiative, which provides gateway, cybersecurity and other resources for merchants to quickly establish an online presence and start accepting electronic payments. We\u2019re also providing a comprehensive suite of installment capabilities through API-based solutions, partnerships and acquisitions, all of which provide greater choice in lending solutions for merchants and consumers, both online and in-store, which is particularly important in a credit challenged post-COVID environment. Our Mastercard installment solution has been available market-wise for several years. Our acquisition of Vyze allowed us to advance our presence with marquee merchants in the U.S. And internationally, we forged partnerships with Pine Labs, Afterpay, [indiscernible] to provide tailored regional solutions. In addition, we recently announced a new partnership with Splitit to provide interest-free installments for e-commerce purchases. Now while the pandemic has accelerated consumer adoption of digital payment solutions, the crisis has also driven increased demand for our services offerings, including cybersecurity and data analytics capabilities. These services allowed to offer differentiated solutions that are valued by a wide variety of customer segments and provide us with a level of revenue diversification. This has become particularly evident in the COVID environment as our services lines grew much faster than the core in the second quarter. Digital commerce continuously requires more advanced cyber solutions. In anticipation of that, we have been scaling our capabilities both organically and inorganically. Our RiskRecon acquisition, for instance, helps ecosystem participants assess and approve cybersecurity, and it is being utilized by several governments, health care providers and leading tech firms. Our Ethoca solutions are scaling quickly. We continue to have strong partners like Bank of America, and our Ethoca digital receipts product has been enabled at more than 18 new merchants over the last few months. New Data, which provides behavioral biometrics capabilities has secured new partnerships with Jack Henry & Associates as well as others. In addition to cyber, our customers are leveraging our data and analytics capabilities to assess, plan and react to the pandemic. Our test and learn platform, powered by our acquisition of APT, is helping partners like Citi to supplement their planning processes. In addition, we have engaged with governments in over 100 data analytics, cybersecurity and disbursement programs in over 30 markets around the world since the crisis began. And finally, our services capabilities provided key elements of differentiation to help us win several deals this quarter. We renewed key consumer partnerships with [indiscernible] Bank in the U.S., Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in UAE, Santander in Mexico and a credit renewal with the Bank of China. On the commercial side, we signed a deal with P&C in the U.S. and established a partnership with Virgin Money in the UK. In addition to our efforts in digital and services, I\u2019d like to touch on a few of our initiatives to address a broader set of payment flows and opportunities. Let\u2019s begin with open banking. As the shift to a digital economy accelerates, demand for open banking services will increase further. In Europe, our open banking connects protect and resolve solutions, which we launched last year continue to gain traction. We\u2019ve added new fintech players like Modulr, DiPocket and Aion, in addition to the recently announced Tesco win. And we are excited about the planned acquisition of Finicity, which advances our open banking strategy here in North America and which we will leverage globally. This will enable a new round of innovation and inclusion in financial services and new products for consumers. Finicity brings best-in-class connectivity with thousands of U.S. banks, along with a robust set of applications, including credit decisioning and account owner verification capabilities, but we\u2019re also attracted to Finicity\u2019s approach to open banking, including their strong commitment to data privacy and transparency, their balanced ecosystem model and their focus on API-based connectivity, all of which are consistent with our principles in the open banking space. We expect the deal to close by the end of the year and believe that the combination of Finicity and our internally developed solutions will provide us with a differentiated set of capabilities. Shifting gears to B2B. Recent research conducted by Carney indicates that COVID has made the digitization of accounts payables and receivable processes a priority from many corporations. We have a commercially launched Mastercard track business payment service. The U.S. launch included 13 distribution partners across the B2B ecosystem, including Global Payments, AvidXchange, Boost Payment Solutions, Fiserv and others. Cross-border payments and international expansion of plan for 2021, talking about cross-border, earlier this week, we announced the partnership with the Bank of Shanghai to allow customers of Mastercard\u2019s cross-border services, which is inclusive of our acquisition of Transat and Mastercard Send, to send international B2B payments into China with less friction and more certainty. This is the latest example of how our cross-border services are enabling financial institutions and partners to reach a variety of payment end points in more than 100 markets, whether over card or a counter \u2013 count infrastructure via a single connection. With that, let me now turn the call over to Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding both special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company\u2019s equity investments. Net revenue was down 17%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were down 5% year-over-year or down 9% if you exclude the full PPT impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 25% and net income was down 27%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was down 26% year-over-year to $1.36, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions offset by $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. Although, we did not complete any share repurchases in the second quarter, we have recently reinitiated our share repurchase program and quarter-to-date through July 27. We have repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares at a cost of $1 billion. So let\u2019s turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV, declined by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. U.S. GDV declined by 5%, with credit down 23%, partially offset by debit growth of 12%. Outside of the U.S., volume declined by 12%. Cross-border volume showed modest improvement progressively through the second quarter and was down 45% for the quarter, recovering of a low off town 55% in mid-April. The decline in cross-border was due to the impact of the pandemic, which has limited cross-border travel to a great extent. Turning to Page 5, switch transactions were also impacted by the pandemic. They stabilized around mid-April at down approximately 24% and improved progressively through the quarter, exiting the quarter close to flat versus year-ago, resulting in Switch transactions being down 10% for the quarter. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Now let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by a decline in transactions and volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by continued growth in our services offerings, which continue to help diversify our revenue base and differentiate our core, as Ajay mentioned. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were down 8% due to the decline 10% in worldwide GDV. The 2 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix. Cross-Border volume fees decreased 52%, while cross-border volumes decreased 45%. The 7 ppt difference is mainly driven by an increase in the proportionate share of intra-Europe cross-border, which is relatively low-yielding compared to other cross-border activity. Transaction processing fees were down 6%, while Switch transactions were down 10%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix. Other revenues were up 14%, including an 4 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our cyber intelligence and data and services solutions, which continue to perform well. Finally, rebates and incentives were down 7%, reflecting a decrease in volumes, partially offset by recent deal activity and were slightly lower than expectations. Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses decreased 5%. This includes 4 ppt increase related to acquisitions. The remaining decrease in operating expenses of 9 ppt, primarily reflects lower advertising and marketing, travel and professional fee related expenses. This is lower than expected, primarily due to the delay of certain sponsorship activity, which we now expect to occur in the third quarter of 2020. Turning to Page 8. Let\u2019s discuss what we\u2019ve seen through the first three weeks of July, where we continue to see improvement in spending levels relative to June and the second quarter. One point to note, while the week ending July 21 show slightly lower growth metrics relative to the prior week, I would not make too much of it since growth in that week is being impacted by the timing of significant e-com, merchant promotional activity from a year ago. In fact, when I look at the early numbers for the fourth week of July, we see a continuation of the growth we saw and the week ending July 14. Starting with Switch volumes, we continue to be in the normalization phase in most markets domestically. The U.S. continues to show positive year-over-year growth and Europe has improved with several markets, such as Italy, Russia and Poland showing positive year-over-year growth and others such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands showing significant improvement. It appears Europe\u2019s economy is recovering faster than others at this stage, which could bode well for us given our strong position in Europe. Each of the other regions have also shown improvement. When you look at how people are spending, we continue to see improvement in card-present transactions, as you would expect as markets open up. Notably, this includes further recovery in restaurant and hotel spend, as well as an increase in healthcare spending, while retail continues to hold up well. Card-not-present spend remains healthy. Trends in switch transactions are similar to what we are seeing in switch volumes, as they are impacted by the same factors for the most part. One point of note, in the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 37% of in-person purchase transactions up from 28% a year-ago. In terms of cross border, as expected, intra-Europe has shown the most improvement as border restrictions within Europe have been relaxed. As you can see, however, cross-border outside of Europe remains in the stabilization phase, with some recent signs of improvement in Asia Pacific and North America, which have been offset by declines in Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Turning now to Page 9 for some additional color on the cross-border volume trends. You can see that the trends we laid out through the quarter-over-quarter continued. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border has improved modestly, mainly due to continued improvement in intra-Europe travel. If you look at the orange line, our present spend continues to improve. Since June 21, we have seen a 15 ppt improvement in card-present, travel and entertainment volumes in particular, primarily related to spend on lodging and restaurants. We have also seen increased card-present spend in other discretionary categories, such as clothing and home improvement. Card-not-present, which is the yellow line on the chart has been more resilient and as held up well. looking at the green line, if you exclude online travel card-not-present spend remains positive and reflect some shift to card-present spend as travel restrictions begin to relax and as I just mentioned, some difficult prior year accounts related to e-com, merchant promotional activity in the third week of July. We remain confident that cross-border volumes will continue to improve as travel restrictions are relaxed and believe a return to the growth phase is dependent on an improvement in consumer confidence that is in turn related to the availability of Electro-Therapeutics and ultimately vaccines. Turning now to Page 10 and our outlook going forward. As we established last quarter, given the ongoing uncertainty, we will not be providing a forward view for net revenues for either the third quarter or the year at this time. We do intend, however, to continue to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics, to help you understand the trends we are seeing. I would like to make a few additional comments to help you with your modeling. First, with respect to cross-border, in line with our previous outlook, we expect the recovery in intra-Europe travel will outpace the recovery in other cross-border travel. As a reminder, intra-Europe transactions are low yielding and other cross-border transactions. Secondly, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to increase sequentially reflecting increased deal activity in Q3. Turning to operating expenses. I want to reinforce that we are carefully managing through this period to preserve our ability to invest in strategically important initiatives that will deliver on our long-term growth opportunities, digital, cyber, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. In the meantime, we will save where as appropriate based on factors such as market readiness and customer demand, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely and adapt quickly as circumstances change. We expect operating expenses to be down low single digits in Q3 versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects sequentially higher A&M spend, primarily due to increased sponsorship activity and digital campaigns. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue for each of the third and fourth quarters and will have a minimal impact to operating expenses over the same time periods. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 ppt to revenue for both Q3 and the year and 6 to 7 ppt to operating expenses for both Q3 and the year, assuming the transaction with nets closes in Q3 and the Finicity transaction closes by the end of the year. On the other income and expenses line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the debt we have issued and prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. With respect to the tax rate for the year, we now expect to be closer to the bottom end of the 17% to 18% range we last provided, assuming the geographic mix of the business does not change significantly. So to sum it up, we are seeing signs of normalization domestically in most markets. Our service lines continue to perform very well, and we are in a very strong position to take advantage of the accelerating digital shift and address the significant opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren to begin the Q&A session.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Sachin. Casey, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the margins, they were better than we expected. Just interested to know, was there \u2013 because expense growth had looked like it was controlled more than you guys anticipated. Were there some onetime events there that got pushed out? Or is that just better cost control that hopefully can continue? And then kind of part to that, I guess, secondly, why were incentives lower than expectations? I think that\u2019s the comment you made, Sachin. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Good morning, Bryan. So on your question on margins, you\u2019re right. Our expenses did come in lower than what our expectations were. And it was, like I said, it was driven primarily by just the timing of when our sponsorship activities and the associated expenses with that occurred. So we expected some of that to occur in the second quarter. As we can see, a lot of the events, which Mastercard sponsors, didn\u2019t necessarily come to fruition because of the pandemic in the second quarter. We\u2019re now expecting for that to happen in the third quarter. And so like I said, I kind of think about that more in terms of the shift in operating expenses between the second and the third quarter. On your question on rebates and incentives. It\u2019s really a function of \u2013 we go into a quarter. We think about what our expectations on rebates and incentives based on what new and renewed deals we might be entering into. And really, I think the lower rebates and incentives relative to our expectations in the second quarter is a function of what actually ends up closing in a given quarter relative to what our expectations were. So like I said, we do expect that there will be an uptick in our rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross in the third quarter on account of new deals, which we expect to occur in the third quarter.\nAjay Banga: The only thing I\u2019d add to that is, Bryan, this is Ajay, is that underlying what\u2019s going on in the expense base of the company, is a lot of effort to ensure that we are more thoughtful about what we spend based on the readiness of our markets and our clients to accept the new things we are doing. So you do see an expense-based reduction in totality. But that\u2019s \u2013 we are then using that ability to put it back into the investment areas that we want to and taking some of that to the bottom line. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on inside our expenses. The A&M part is moving from a quarter to the other, but really what\u2019s underlying our expenses, as Sachin spoke about in his prepared remarks, is that. And Michael and the team are doing a terrific job on that.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks so much. Stay safe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. If we think about the structural tailwinds you\u2019re seeing that are more pronounced and maybe sustainable given the pandemic. You talked about contactless, obviously, digital being up. But you guys don\u2019t mind, just honing in on the services pieces obviously, the other revenue is up. And there\u2019s definitely services flowing into the other transaction lines as well, so card-not-present fraud. I guess, how big can this be? Do you think that\u2019s sustainable even beyond the pandemic as well? And then can they offset potentially some of the cross-border headwinds we see? Thanks, guys.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, Darrin, it\u2019s Michael here. Let me take that. So as you rightly said, there is this accelerated shift to digital, yes, and we see that right now. What does all of that mean for the business overall? Well, first of all, that accelerates the secular shift to digital payments. So that\u2019s all fantastic. But it has a downstream impact into our services, for sure. So more digital transactions versus more cash transactions is more data. More data means more desire and more need for data analytics capabilities, but also to protect that data. So our cyber solutions are going to benefit from that in the long run. We\u2019ve clearly seen that. As long as the underlying trend to digital continues, which we believe it will, our services portfolio, which \u2013 it hits right on to these points should be benefiting. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question here comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nCraig Maurer: Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Craig Maurer. So I wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, can you tell us the \u2013 how your value-add services revenue are distributed among your different lines of revenue? And what value-added services are enabling you to win deals versus competition? And secondly, with the class action lawsuit against Plaid pending in California, I was hoping that you could reiterate for us the differences between Finicity and Plaid that made you more comfortable with the Finicity business.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Craig, it\u2019s Sachin. So as relates to where our services revenue reside, they are \u2013 for the most part, reside between other revenues and our transaction processing fees. It depending on the nature of the service, a, either comes into other revenues. And there is some amount which comes in transaction processing fees to the extent they are related to the number of transactions which are switched. You kind of asked the question as to what services are helping us differentiate and win at the core, I would argue that it\u2019s \u2013 if you start from what Michael said earlier, which is ability to gain access to data, utilizing data to analyze and provide advice to our clients as to how they can optimize their portfolios, how they can end up growing their top line while still managing their expense base is a key enabler on one side. And then separate from that, a pain point which exists, which is around fraud, is another area, which where our \u2013 and our cyber intelligence capabilities are a key differentiating factor.\nAjay Banga: And Craig, it\u2019s Ajay. We throw one point in and then pass it over to Michael for the Finicity answer. Just think about \u2013 when you convert a portfolio during a flip. When you convert a portfolio doing a flip, there are dormant cards in that portfolio and the ability for the client to come out in a better place with less dormancy, more active, more engaged customers, that is determined a lot by our ability to use data analytics in a sensible way. That\u2019s one example. Like that, there are many examples that enable us to put our best foot forward during such an opportunity. So Michael, Finicity.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. I just have one point to add to that. As we turn out of the COVID pandemic, I was talking earlier about understanding the crisis reacting to it and planning for the future. Our test-and-learn stuff works almost like a hook. The crisis got us engaged on test and learn at a much greater scale than before, and that leads into conversations in more in the BAU realm of our business around payments with our customers. So we talked about planning processes on branch opening and what retailers are doing to stocking their shelves and so forth. But that leads into payment opportunities, which is, again, a way for us to differentiate and win in payments. Now on Finicity. So I have to say from the first interaction that we had with the Finicity team, with the leadership team, with Steve and Nick over there, the founders, we felt a very strong cultural affinity here. So here is a company that has been the leading voice and setting up the FDX, the financial data exchange approach. Transparent business model, a model that works for everybody in open banking, open and that is for fintechs, it\u2019s for banks, it\u2019s for consumers. They have been a voice in that for years. And that\u2019s pretty much exactly where we are going. When you dig a little more into the detail, you see a company that has very strong relationships with U.S. banks. I talked about the connectivity earlier. But they have a series of agreements, data sharing agreements in place with several of the large U.S. banks, Chase, Wells and Capital One, for example. So there is a really good reaction that we got \u2013 once we announced the deal in terms of our banking partners is saying, this is a good partner for you. When it comes to data quality, one of the important things that matters for fintechs and banks alike as well as consumers, is that the data quality of what is being shared here is at the highest point. It is cleansed. It works at all times. And here, Finicity is clearly a leader. The applications that they bring, specifically around credit decisioning makes Finicity a leader. This is something that I believe is a very useful. Use case. It\u2019s one that will be needed, certainly as we come out of the crisis. If you think about their boost product, here the company was thinking around financial inclusion for a while. As we have with the boost product, it basically helps people improve their credit score, so they can get access to credit. So all around, I see clear differentiation, of Finicity versus other players that make them, as far as I can see, our best possible partner.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Question about fraud and e-com in midst of the pandemic, the higher \u2013 significantly higher rates of fraud and e-com has kind of become a lot more evident. Can you just speak maybe more holistically to Mastercard\u2019s initiative to help the broader ecosystem address and rapidly reduced online? Specifically things like accelerating deployment of tokens. I mean, are there tools you can use, like creating different interchange categories or changing liability rules, et cetera, to kind of accelerate and help the whole ecosystem move in the direction of rapidly addressing the fraud issues. Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Hey, Lisa, it\u2019s Michael here. So let me take this question. As you rightly said, we talked about it earlier. We see fraud rates increasing, more transaction happening digitally. So there\u2019s no surprise there. Our broad strategy is along a number of pillars. We want to prevent fraud to start with. As and when transactions occur, we want to ensure that authentication as best as possible. We want to help our customers assess their cybersecurity status to start with. So those are the key dimensions of our strategy. But here you pointed to an important aspect here. The underlying components of the digital economy, like tokenization that we have invested so much effort in over the last couple of years, come to play here. And tokens can do many things. But for once they \u2013 what they do is, because it\u2019s a onetime token, this, a compromise transaction cannot be used by anybody for anything else. So what it does is it makes it safer, but it also drives a great user experience because the approval rates are going to be higher. So that effort is paying off significantly. So we keep expanding our capabilities here with RiskRecon. I talked about cybersecurity readiness. That is \u2013 we can run fast enough right now. There\u2019s \u2013 everybody\u2019s seeking all those merchants that are coming online these days, trying to establish an online business. We see great demand for that. And then, of course, once transactions happen, and there might be faulty transactions of some sort, the whole charge back process comes into site and here as an ecosystem leader as a custodian of the payments ecosystem. We\u2019re putting out our solutions to help making chargeback solutions. Go away even before, a chargeback is actually filed. That\u2019s what Ethoca does for us. So around about, I think we\u2019re quite well positioned here. But tokens, as you said, make a real big difference.\nSachin Mehra: And Lisa, you can see the effort of both organic and inorganic build that we\u2019ve been trying to do in that space. The organic build was the tokens and the investment that went into developing the idea and building these capabilities. And the inorganic build includes Ethoca, RiskRecon and other such efforts. And then the organic expenses on those to help them expand their reach. So it\u2019s kind of a combination of that, that come into our system. And that\u2019s the discipline we follow on our acquisitions. And for a couple of years, we tell you that this is ex-acquisition. And then after that, it\u2019s in our base because that is how it has to be.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good morning. The acquisition in open banking, that area, obviously, has been getting a lot of attention. I was wondering if you can give a little more color on what Mastercard strategy is in open banking and how you see that evolving? And then Michael, you\u2019ll be taking over as CEO in the near future. I just wonder, any color on how you feel like you\u2019ll stylistically be different than Ajay? Will you be as colorful as Ajay? And then what are you most excited about?\nAjay Banga: Well, you turn to grow from here, and get a turban, but that\u2019s a whole different topic but great beyond the purview of this call. Michael, go ahead.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Let\u2019s go open banking first. Meanwhile, I can think about this question in the back of my mind. All right. Open banking. So open banking is in the end all about putting control into the hands of a consumer to use their data, in this case, the data in their bank accounts to get access to better financial services just generally benefit from the data. So that\u2019s the whole principle. Our strategy is, when you look at this ecosystem that\u2019s opening up here, is you got a lot of fintechs out there, third-party providers that are coming in and wanting to provide such financial services, and there\u2019s a lot of banks that hold that data. So we believe there\u2019s a role for us to be a trusted party in the middle between the fintechs and the banks and all that based on consumer content to provide seamless transactions and make sure that everybody is a good player and enables the consumer to benefit from their data. So that\u2019s broadly the strategy. We have built those solutions in Europe. We brought them to market last year, Connect, Protect, Resolve. I talked about it earlier. Good progress there. 11 countries, 2,000 banks on that works really well in Europe. And then here in North America, there\u2019s a market that grew up in a different way, not driven by regulatory pushes in Europe. But basically, incumbents are there that having slightly different models on providing such services to consumers. We looked at Finicity here, as I laid out earlier, a good fit for us. That will be our starting point in North America to assume that trusted raw between fintechs and banks. In the end, what I see is us participating in data transactions or in payment transactions, both will happen in the world of open banking. And as we participate in car transaction and build a portfolio of value-add services on top of that, it makes those transactions better and differentiated from Mastercard, as we seek to do the same in open banking. So in terms of open banking applications, I\u2019ll give you an example out of our world of loyalty services, our pay with rewards API, that would be something that we seek to deploy to the fintechs that are participating in the open banking ecosystem. There might be a neo-bank that says, I want to have a pay with rewards capability and here\u2019s a premium API from Mastercard. And of course, around all of this is everybody is trying to figure out their open banking strategy, it\u2019s a great opportunity for our consulting business for advisers. So infrastructure, application services is the way that we think about a go-to-market. And I think with our organic stuff and Finicity, we have the tools that we need. Now that gave me just two minutes to think about the colorful question. So you know what? We have been since this whole pandemic started, basically locked up together for the last 4.5 months here in purchase. Extended family, I would say. And I first found out all the things I don\u2019t want to be like. And there\u2019s a few.\nAjay Banga: There\u2019s a guy who\u2019s working for 20 years, and now he made some. So don\u2019t give him some remarks for his ability to be a bright spark.\nMichael Miebach: No. But in all seriousness, when you look at our strategy, hope, we\u2019re doing in terms of the accelerated drive to digital economy, we\u2019ve got to just be on that and maximize that as much as we can. But at the same time, I just do want to make the point that we do see, even in these four months, consumer behavior is changing. Yes, people are using more digital services, but also when there is an opportunity to go back on the Street and buy at that local shopper around the corner, then they do that. So the good thing is we have a business that benefits from the trend from cash to contactless and cards, and we will continue to drive that as hard as a digital partner. And that gives us the two legs to stand on. And then there\u2019s services. I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity, Lisa\u2019s question. We just talked about it in terms of what else we can do the longer-term trend linked to underlying digital data flowing through. And in places like open banking, we haven\u2019t touched on it. New payment flows, B2B, real-time payments, all that. I don\u2019t see a dramatic change to our strategy because even those are just early steps on where we are. The turban thing, that would basically mean I need to get up like an hour earlier to buying the whole thing. But I don\u2019t want to.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey, sorry. Good morning. I wanted to ask \u2013 I asked vis-\u00e0-vis, so I\u2019ll ask you guys as well. Just the spread between U.S. credit and debit growth, it looks like it was even wider for you than Visa. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on why \u2013 how much of it is secular versus stimulus? And also any impact on yield with this credit and debit shift here? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Hey Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Sachin. So yes, you\u2019re seeing the spread take place in the second quarter between what you would expect in terms of a greater decline in credit and actually pretty good growth in debit. I would tell you that some of the second quarter numbers are impacted by the stimulus programs, right? So as more and more money gets deposited in people\u2019s bank accounts, they\u2019re utilizing the debit product to go and access that amount.\nAjay Banga: It\u2019s not as stable. Savings and banks have gone up too.\nSachin Mehra: Correct. And so I do think you\u2019re seeing a little bit of that impact come through. But by and large, if you just step back and you think about where we are from an economic standpoint, given the uncertainty in the economy, people tend to rely more on a debit product than they do on credit, right? And kind of \u2013 the reality is, we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize on both those trends, i.e., the fact that people are accessing their stimuli funds through debit products. But also the fact that our strength in debit, I mean we go on a global basis and you think about our presence in debit globally, we stand well-positioned to take advantage of that situation as people spend more on the debit product. So look, I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going to go. What I can tell you is we\u2019re seeing a little bit bump up in terms of our debit growth rates in the second quarter driven by the stimulus program.\nTien-tsin Huang: It\u2019s enough. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I know Sachin, you said you wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the slowdown in the last week, but I\u2019m just curious if you guys are seeing a meaningful divergence in trends in states that are seeing a spike in the viruses versus not? And then just on cross border, should we just assume you can\u2019t see material improvement unless there\u2019s some kind of medicinal cure for the virus? Or how should we think about the progression of cross-border on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. Hey Sanjay, so on the comment around the week of July 21, it\u2019s just exactly like I said. Look, I mean, let\u2019s not put too much until the week of July 21 because what I\u2019m seeing in the early numbers for the week of July 28 is actually seeing back to the trends we were seeing on the week of July 14. In other words, the growth levels we were seeing back in the week of July 14. What you did have is the impact in the third week of July related to the tougher year-over-year comps on account of some promotional activities done by e-commerce merchants. But I wouldn\u2019t put too much more into that. The trajectory is a good solid growth trajectory, which we\u2019ve been seeing here. On your question about impact of the back and forth in terms of pauses and reopenings taking place in different parts of the world and different parts of the country, I would just say we continue to run the business based on the full framework, which we\u2019ve got, the whole containment stabilization, normalization and growth. And the reality is it\u2019s going to be non-linear. We are going to see puts and takes, which will take place. But when I look at it on a holistic basis, if I look at the most recent numbers for the fourth week of July, we\u2019re seeing the growth trajectory is on the second week of July. Mike, do you want to take the cross border?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. On the cross-border side, so interesting question, just picking up from what Sachin just said. So the full phase framework, what we put in there is, we believe we will see normalization on a path to growth, once social distancing measures and border restrictions are released. So the point about a vaccine will be a good thing to have and medicine will be a good thing to have. But it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see flat travel until that point. We\u2019re already starting to see border restrictions being eased in some parts of the world. Europe, for example, there are some early green shoots there. People do get into their cars and drive across borders. We see domestic travel around the world happening. So once border restrictions are lifted, we will see some increase there. So that is the first step. Then you go into therapeutics and vaccines. So just to come back in a big way, I think you\u2019re right. But it\u2019s not going to be kind of like an L where it all happens at one point. It will be a gradual improvement.\nSachin Mehra: It\u2019s Sanjay, I\u2019ll just add to what Michael just said. I mean we should think about border restrictions even in the context of U.S. and Canada and U.S. with Mexico, right? I mean we typically think border restrictions that we are thinking for Europe. But to the extent border restrictions are lifted between the Canada and the U.S., the U.S. and Mexico, important corridors, by the way, from a cross-border travel standpoint, those are good things for us to have. Secondly, the travel bubbles, which are being created across various corridors, as you think about in Asia-Pacific, between Australia and New Zealand, between China and Singapore, as those start to come into effect, we\u2019re going to see probably some of the impact of that come through. I don\u2019t know when. But I think those are things to keep your eye on as well.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate taking the question. Michael, I think you mentioned the services as being an important contributor to recent wins. I wonder if you and Ajay just generally can comment on sales cycles and in the current environment? And whether perhaps they\u2019ve shifted, elongated, whether you think there\u2019s pent-up demand and we could see perhaps more portfolio flips or more activity generally as the economy recovers? Just trying to get a sense of cadence for new wins.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Let me start on that, and then Ajay can chime in. So on the services side, when you look at the different elements that we have in our portfolio \u2013 so here is starting off with cyber, there\u2019s an immediate need. So from a customer demand perspective, there is a pull. So in terms of this help is needed right now, there isn\u2019t any debate. And that makes it fairly easy from a cycle perspective. Most of our solutions other than what we call generally network delivered. So that is relatively straightforward for us to switch on such a capability and make a difference. At the other end of the spectrum would be strategy and consulting projects, which involve potentially some travel. And here, we\u2019ve had some impact, those of sales cycles take longer. The demand is lesser because people are worrying more about it today versus the day after tomorrow. So that\u2019s what I would say where we are on that. We see it, the scaling for the network delivered stuff is good. The people delivered stuff, we\u2019ll continue to engage. And we do believe, as I said earlier before, being a partner, the best possible partner that we can be in the crisis, let\u2019s say, with our data analytics, test-and-learn platform or our cyber platforms, make us a good partner for the longer-term things as we go out of this. Governments, for example, they\u2019re looking at longer-term strategy products. Open banking is an opportunity like that. At any given point in time, there\u2019s a whole set of services and engagements around real-time payments, and we expect those to really pick up over time.\nAjay Banga: And to your point about sales cycles on other things like core products. I think the only trade where I find a faster sales cycle is their merchants were cobrands and were impacted by severe need for liquidity or circumstances of navigating through this. They have reupped many deals because that\u2019s kind of what you would do in their shoes. But I think I haven\u2019t seen a big change in the selling cycle with issuers per se. And I don\u2019t expect there to be some dramatic change there. I do see this thing with some of the merchants. But that\u2019s a few of them were directly impacted. And that business is challenged right now, and you can understand their circumstances.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on the composition of the 5% card growth in the quarter? Was that mostly debit versus credit as people wanted to purchase online. And then my follow-up really relates to Europe, which historically has been debit-centric. And historically, Continental Europe has been a real strength of Mastercard. Could you comment more deeply on the trends you\u2019re seeing in Europe by country? And to the extent we see debit lead us out of this, what are the longer-term implications for revenue yields?\nAjay Banga: Yes. So let me take the part about Europe for a second. Yes, we have had strength in debit in Europe, in Continental Europe, in particular. We were weaker on debit in the UK, that has begun to change over the course of the last couple of years with the wins we\u2019ve been telling you about, but they have to all get into the market with those cards. Do I see that as good for us? Absolutely. Europe continues to be a very attractive growth market for our company. Over the years, our growth in Europe has been both due to our share growth and the flips and wins that we\u2019ve been having and telling you about, but also due to the natural change, not just, by the way, from large global competitors. But even from domestic schemes by European country, where their ability to keep pace with innovation and the things that issuers wanted have hamstrung them. And therefore, we have begun to see more and more transactions across domestic European markets. And I continue to be very constructively optimistic about Europe over the next few years. So that\u2019s kind of the first part about Europe.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Just a few things to add on that. When you look at Europe, maybe Western Europe comes to mind, but we see a huge opportunity for cash displacement in Eastern Europe. That\u2019s been driving our growth there, so that will continue. And then there\u2019s countries in the middle. Like Germany, which was cash heavy, and COVID has clearly accelerated the trend there.\nAjay Banga: So it will still contribute to that.\nMichael Miebach: And definitely, at least with my cross-border e-commerce. No, but the point here is the contactless is rising. So here\u2019s a market that is a significant opportunity that\u2019s, again, rising the wave. To Ajay\u2019s point, we are partnering with all the local schemes here, bringing our best practices to bear. So Europe, I continue to see non-cash displacement on differentiation services and opportunity across the board.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. And Dave, to your question around card growth, we\u2019re seeing growth across both credit and debit. There\u2019s a little bit stronger growth across debit, and you should expect that. And the reason you should expect that is just general propensity to spend on debit. But also all the work that we are doing as a company, on the migration from Maestro to Debit Mastercard. And that kind of quarter-over-quarter, you are going to see that come through in our schedules, where you see there\u2019s a declining card park of Maestro cards relative to what\u2019s there in the debit Mastercard side.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Stay safe and healthy.\nAjay Banga: You too.\nMichael Miebach: You too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Ajay. Hi, Michael. Hi, Sachin. Good to hear your voices. I have a broad regulatory question. I just wanted to get your views on a range of things, Durbin, EPI. Any long-term thoughts in the wire card saga, what might emerge from that? Any company-specific update on net? We\u2019ve seen some of the news flow recently, obviously, but how are you thinking on that?\nAjay Banga: Look, I\u2019m going to take a start and then Tim is dying to answer your question, right? He\u2019s actually looking at you beaming from ear to ear. And I suspect he might have asked you to ask. So payment schemes in general. I continue to believe that this industry of payments as it becomes more and more important and interesting to governments around the world as they all take on cash and they try and move their economies to digital. I think you should expect attention from governments, opinion leaders, regulators, legislators around the world to the industry. That\u2019s not a bad thing. That is part of what\u2019s driving the secular change in our favor. It raises the bar for our industry to do so in then that is seen as value-added to their local countries and their local businesses. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been trying to do through our financial inclusion efforts, through our center for inclusive growth, through our partnership with governments. This is not a new thing we\u2019ve been working on. This is a decade-old effort to take some leadership position in this space. That doesn\u2019t make it less of something we should be careful about, just telling you how we\u2019re conscious in dealing with it. So Tim?\nTim Murphy: Thanks, Ajay. Yes, fully agree. And let me just in light of that frame, let me just sort of hit the specific things you mentioned in order. So in terms of net, you mentioned that we continue to work through the regulatory approval process for that transaction. Feeling good about it. We\u2019re making progress. I don\u2019t have a lot more to say there, but that\u2019s continues to be underway and we\u2019re moving forward. In terms of staying in Europe, in terms of the EPI initiative, which for others is a potential effort in Europe to create an alternative sort of European payment architecture and ecosystem, we\u2019ll see whether that gets traction or not. These have been \u2013 there have been multiple efforts over the years. It is actively being considered. And our view is we welcome it, and we look forward to the opportunity to participate in it. I think we\u2019ve demonstrated both in our core card business and our ACH business, the opportunity or the possibility to really drive value for all parties and to earn some revenue for ourselves by participating in these sorts of local or regional initiatives. And so we don\u2019t fear EPI. We embrace it. We will see whether it gets traction, but we intend to participate.\nAjay Banga: Particularly with our approach to multi-rail. Remember, we are not just card rail dependent. And so our attitude towards multi-rail is our strength.\nTim Murphy: Yes, indeed. And then just coming back to the U.S. on Durbin, so two things there. The \u2013 you will have seen in our disclosures that the FTC has now opened up a formal investigation into Durbin compliance. We feel very good about how we have managed this company and delivered \u2013 very fully compliant, Durbin compliant approaches we compete hard in debit. Debit is a very competitive space. Durbin contemplates that. It has rules around net compensation, which we are rigorous in adhering to. So I look forward to the chance to explain our approach to the FTC, and we will do that as we need to. There\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s an early stage investigation, and we\u2019re participating fully. And then we might end on Wirecard, and I\u2019ll make a comment and then if Sachin has more to say. I think as you know, Wirecard in terms of its engagement with Mastercard, there\u2019s principally two entities that engage in our network: one, a German-based bank; and then the Wirecard business in the UK. We\u2019re working very closely through this process. They have a number of roles in the payment ecosystem, including processing, acquiring and so on. We\u2019re very comfortable in our close connections, both with Wirecard and the regulators in Europe that consumer deposits have been appropriately ring-fenced. And so we\u2019re staying very close to the situation and making sure that we\u2019re working with them and with other parties to minimize any impacts on the wider ecosystem. Sachin, you want to add?\nSachin Mehra: The only other thing I\u2019ll just add is, I think you\u2019re all very well aware about the risk management practices, which are there at Mastercard. We have very robust risk management practices, and those have actually held us in pretty good stead in this instance as well. So we monitor, we\u2019ve got real-time engagement taking place in terms of seeing what kind of traffic is going through our network, as well as put in the requisite collateral measures as and when necessary to ensure that we\u2019re appropriately covered.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Great. Thank you. Ajay, do you have any final comments?\nAjay Banga: Yes. So thank you for your question. I\u2019m going to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. I\u2019m going to begin where we start at the beginning. These are difficult times for all of us. Yet for our business, the pandemic is actually helping to accelerate the secular shift to electric \u2013 electronic forms of payment. The foundational work we have been doing in areas like tokenization, contactless, digital acceptance, cybersecurity, B2B, these position us very well to capitalize on this accelerating trend. And our services capabilities allow us to offer differentiated solutions to a very wide range of customers, and very importantly, to help us diversify our revenue base and build multiple legs to our revenue stool. We continue to drive our core business forward.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajay Banga",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody. So over the past several months, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of our society, and we remain focused on supporting our employees, our issuers, merchants, small businesses and government partners to help them navigate through what I think are completely unprecedented times. You may recall that we introduced a four-phase framework for monitoring spending levels and how we would run our company on our last earnings call: Containment, stabilization, normalization and growth. Now in the second quarter, we saw a progressive improvement in volume trends over the course for quarter, driven by the opening up of domestic economies. And today, we believe that most markets are in the normalization phase domestically, where truly occurs and social distancing and mobility limitations are relaxed and spending begins to gradually recover with some sectors recovering faster than others. We expect that progressing through the normalization phase and ultimately moving to the growth phase, essentially, bringing us back to pre-COVID days is very much dependent upon turning the tide on infection, which you've seen in Europe, in Asia and the United States Northeast, but also is ultimately tied to the broad availability of a vaccine and proven therapeutics. We expect that the progress through the phases will be non-linear. We have seen that in places like Japan and potentially in the Southern United States, where we are monitoring for the effects of the reintroduction of social distancing restrictions. Meanwhile, the world is becoming more digital. Our services are in strong demand, and we expect that travel will begin to come back as borders reopen, the first signs of which we are beginning to see in Europe. The COVID crisis has driven an acceleration in the use of electronic forms of payment with much greater adoption of digital and contactless solutions. Now we believe those would sustain beyond the pandemic, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on those. The pandemic has also highlighted the resiliency of our differentiated business model, which is reflected in our financial performance. Our services growth remains strong. It's outpacing the goal and it drives meaningful differentiation and diversification. Our digital and multi-rail solutions are enabling us to address key opportunities by providing customer choice and the capabilities required to capture a wide range of payment flows. And we continue to win deals across all our core products. So we are focused on what we can control. We are focused on executing against our strategy. We are focused on managing the business for the long-term and we are focused on investing in key strategic priorities, in areas like open banking, real-time payments, Cyber and Intelligence Solutions and B2B themes. Now you're going to hear lots of that from Michael. And before I hand it over to him, I'd like to share a few comments on diversity and inclusion. Through the events we have watched unfold in the United States and elsewhere over the last several weeks, our society is facing the difficult truth that there is a long way to go to ensure that the fundamental human rights of all people are equally respected. There is no place for racism or discrimination in our communities, in our company, in our hearts. For years, we here in Mastercard have championed inclusion. We have focused on issues that matter to the black community as well as to others, including delivering on our commitment to bring 500 million individuals into the financial system. We've extended that pledge, as you know, to 1 billion people by 2025, including 50 million micro and small businesses and 25 million women entrepreneurs. We are long-standing partners of several, several rights organizations and we have closed the racial pay gap over the years. In 2019, Mastercard employees in the United States, who are people of color, have paid the same as Caucasian employees. So we are proud of where we are, but we recognize how much more there is still to do. And to that end, we have launched a companywide, long-term initiative to drive change for our people, for the market we work in and for society at large, including bolstering black recruitment and training, driving financial inclusion and addressing the wealth and opportunity gap faced by black communities. We must and we will capitalize on this opportunity to effect change. So now over to Michael. The only thing I'd add to that is, Bryan, this is Ajay, is that underlying what's going on in the expense base of the company, is a lot of effort to ensure that we are more thoughtful about what we spend based on the readiness of our markets and our clients to accept the new things we are doing. So you do see an expense-based reduction in totality. But that's \u2013 we are then using that ability to put it back into the investment areas that we want to and taking some of that to the bottom line. And I think that's what's going on inside our expenses. The A&M part is moving from a quarter to the other, but really what's underlying our expenses, as Sachin spoke about in his prepared remarks, is that. And Michael and the team are doing a terrific job on that. And Craig, it's Ajay. We throw one point in and then pass it over to Michael for the Finicity answer. Just think about \u2013 when you convert a portfolio during a flip. When you convert a portfolio doing a flip, there are dormant cards in that portfolio and the ability for the client to come out in a better place with less dormancy, more active, more engaged customers, that is determined a lot by our ability to use data analytics in a sensible way. That's one example. Like that, there are many examples that enable us to put our best foot forward during such an opportunity. So Michael, Finicity. Well, you turn to grow from here, and get a turban, but that's a whole different topic but great beyond the purview of this call. Michael, go ahead. There's a guy who's working for 20 years, and now he made some. So don't give him some remarks for his ability to be a bright spark. It's not as stable. Savings and banks have gone up too. And to your point about sales cycles on other things like core products. I think the only trade where I find a faster sales cycle is their merchants were cobrands and were impacted by severe need for liquidity or circumstances of navigating through this. They have reupped many deals because that's kind of what you would do in their shoes. But I think I haven't seen a big change in the selling cycle with issuers per se. And I don't expect there to be some dramatic change there. I do see this thing with some of the merchants. But that's a few of them were directly impacted. And that business is challenged right now, and you can understand their circumstances. Yes. So let me take the part about Europe for a second. Yes, we have had strength in debit in Europe, in Continental Europe, in particular. We were weaker on debit in the UK, that has begun to change over the course of the last couple of years with the wins we've been telling you about, but they have to all get into the market with those cards. Do I see that as good for us? Absolutely. Europe continues to be a very attractive growth market for our company. Over the years, our growth in Europe has been both due to our share growth and the flips and wins that we've been having and telling you about, but also due to the natural change, not just, by the way, from large global competitors. But even from domestic schemes by European country, where their ability to keep pace with innovation and the things that issuers wanted have hamstrung them. And therefore, we have begun to see more and more transactions across domestic European markets. And I continue to be very constructively optimistic about Europe over the next few years. So that's kind of the first part about Europe. So it will still contribute to that. You too. Look, I'm going to take a start and then Tim is dying to answer your question, right? He's actually looking at you beaming from ear to ear. And I suspect he might have asked you to ask. So payment schemes in general. I continue to believe that this industry of payments as it becomes more and more important and interesting to governments around the world as they all take on cash and they try and move their economies to digital. I think you should expect attention from governments, opinion leaders, regulators, legislators around the world to the industry. That's not a bad thing. That is part of what's driving the secular change in our favor. It raises the bar for our industry to do so in then that is seen as value-added to their local countries and their local businesses. And that's kind of what we've been trying to do through our financial inclusion efforts, through our center for inclusive growth, through our partnership with governments. This is not a new thing we've been working on. This is a decade-old effort to take some leadership position in this space. That doesn't make it less of something we should be careful about, just telling you how we're conscious in dealing with it. So Tim? Particularly with our approach to multi-rail. Remember, we are not just card rail dependent. And so our attitude towards multi-rail is our strength. Yes. So thank you for your question. I'm going to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. I'm going to begin where we start at the beginning. These are difficult times for all of us. Yet for our business, the pandemic is actually helping to accelerate the secular shift to electric \u2013 electronic forms of payment. The foundational work we have been doing in areas like tokenization, contactless, digital acceptance, cybersecurity, B2B, these position us very well to capitalize on this accelerating trend. And our services capabilities allow us to offer differentiated solutions to a very wide range of customers, and very importantly, to help us diversify our revenue base and build multiple legs to our revenue stool. We continue to drive our core business forward. I think our multi-rail, open banking and cross-border solutions are enabling us to address a broader set of payment flows, and you should expect to see us continue to be very focused on these opportunities. Thank you for your support for the company. Thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and excluding both special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was down 17%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and includes a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses were down 5% year-over-year or down 9% if you exclude the full PPT impact of acquisitions. Operating income was down 25% and net income was down 27%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was down 26% year-over-year to $1.36, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions offset by $0.03 contribution from share repurchases. Although, we did not complete any share repurchases in the second quarter, we have recently reinitiated our share repurchase program and quarter-to-date through July 27. We have repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares at a cost of $1 billion. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV, declined by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. U.S. GDV declined by 5%, with credit down 23%, partially offset by debit growth of 12%. Outside of the U.S., volume declined by 12%. Cross-border volume showed modest improvement progressively through the second quarter and was down 45% for the quarter, recovering of a low off town 55% in mid-April. The decline in cross-border was due to the impact of the pandemic, which has limited cross-border travel to a great extent. Turning to Page 5, switch transactions were also impacted by the pandemic. They stabilized around mid-April at down approximately 24% and improved progressively through the quarter, exiting the quarter close to flat versus year-ago, resulting in Switch transactions being down 10% for the quarter. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The decrease in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by a decline in transactions and volumes due to the effects of border restrictions and social distancing measures, partially offset by continued growth in our services offerings, which continue to help diversify our revenue base and differentiate our core, as Ajay mentioned. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were down 8% due to the decline 10% in worldwide GDV. The 2 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix. Cross-Border volume fees decreased 52%, while cross-border volumes decreased 45%. The 7 ppt difference is mainly driven by an increase in the proportionate share of intra-Europe cross-border, which is relatively low-yielding compared to other cross-border activity. Transaction processing fees were down 6%, while Switch transactions were down 10%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix. Other revenues were up 14%, including an 4 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our cyber intelligence and data and services solutions, which continue to perform well. Finally, rebates and incentives were down 7%, reflecting a decrease in volumes, partially offset by recent deal activity and were slightly lower than expectations. Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses decreased 5%. This includes 4 ppt increase related to acquisitions. The remaining decrease in operating expenses of 9 ppt, primarily reflects lower advertising and marketing, travel and professional fee related expenses. This is lower than expected, primarily due to the delay of certain sponsorship activity, which we now expect to occur in the third quarter of 2020. Turning to Page 8. Let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of July, where we continue to see improvement in spending levels relative to June and the second quarter. One point to note, while the week ending July 21 show slightly lower growth metrics relative to the prior week, I would not make too much of it since growth in that week is being impacted by the timing of significant e-com, merchant promotional activity from a year ago. In fact, when I look at the early numbers for the fourth week of July, we see a continuation of the growth we saw and the week ending July 14. Starting with Switch volumes, we continue to be in the normalization phase in most markets domestically. The U.S. continues to show positive year-over-year growth and Europe has improved with several markets, such as Italy, Russia and Poland showing positive year-over-year growth and others such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands showing significant improvement. It appears Europe's economy is recovering faster than others at this stage, which could bode well for us given our strong position in Europe. Each of the other regions have also shown improvement. When you look at how people are spending, we continue to see improvement in card-present transactions, as you would expect as markets open up. Notably, this includes further recovery in restaurant and hotel spend, as well as an increase in healthcare spending, while retail continues to hold up well. Card-not-present spend remains healthy. Trends in switch transactions are similar to what we are seeing in switch volumes, as they are impacted by the same factors for the most part. One point of note, in the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 37% of in-person purchase transactions up from 28% a year-ago. In terms of cross border, as expected, intra-Europe has shown the most improvement as border restrictions within Europe have been relaxed. As you can see, however, cross-border outside of Europe remains in the stabilization phase, with some recent signs of improvement in Asia Pacific and North America, which have been offset by declines in Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Turning now to Page 9 for some additional color on the cross-border volume trends. You can see that the trends we laid out through the quarter-over-quarter continued. In total, if you look at the gray line, total cross-border has improved modestly, mainly due to continued improvement in intra-Europe travel. If you look at the orange line, our present spend continues to improve. Since June 21, we have seen a 15 ppt improvement in card-present, travel and entertainment volumes in particular, primarily related to spend on lodging and restaurants. We have also seen increased card-present spend in other discretionary categories, such as clothing and home improvement. Card-not-present, which is the yellow line on the chart has been more resilient and as held up well. looking at the green line, if you exclude online travel card-not-present spend remains positive and reflect some shift to card-present spend as travel restrictions begin to relax and as I just mentioned, some difficult prior year accounts related to e-com, merchant promotional activity in the third week of July. We remain confident that cross-border volumes will continue to improve as travel restrictions are relaxed and believe a return to the growth phase is dependent on an improvement in consumer confidence that is in turn related to the availability of Electro-Therapeutics and ultimately vaccines. Turning now to Page 10 and our outlook going forward. As we established last quarter, given the ongoing uncertainty, we will not be providing a forward view for net revenues for either the third quarter or the year at this time. We do intend, however, to continue to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics, to help you understand the trends we are seeing. I would like to make a few additional comments to help you with your modeling. First, with respect to cross-border, in line with our previous outlook, we expect the recovery in intra-Europe travel will outpace the recovery in other cross-border travel. As a reminder, intra-Europe transactions are low yielding and other cross-border transactions. Secondly, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to increase sequentially reflecting increased deal activity in Q3. Turning to operating expenses. I want to reinforce that we are carefully managing through this period to preserve our ability to invest in strategically important initiatives that will deliver on our long-term growth opportunities, digital, cyber, data analytics, B2B and multi-rail solutions. In the meantime, we will save where as appropriate based on factors such as market readiness and customer demand, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely and adapt quickly as circumstances change. We expect operating expenses to be down low single digits in Q3 versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects sequentially higher A&M spend, primarily due to increased sponsorship activity and digital campaigns. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue for each of the third and fourth quarters and will have a minimal impact to operating expenses over the same time periods. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 ppt to revenue for both Q3 and the year and 6 to 7 ppt to operating expenses for both Q3 and the year, assuming the transaction with nets closes in Q3 and the Finicity transaction closes by the end of the year. On the other income and expenses line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the debt we have issued and prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. With respect to the tax rate for the year, we now expect to be closer to the bottom end of the 17% to 18% range we last provided, assuming the geographic mix of the business does not change significantly. So to sum it up, we are seeing signs of normalization domestically in most markets. Our service lines continue to perform very well, and we are in a very strong position to take advantage of the accelerating digital shift and address the significant opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Yes. Good morning, Bryan. So on your question on margins, you're right. Our expenses did come in lower than what our expectations were. And it was, like I said, it was driven primarily by just the timing of when our sponsorship activities and the associated expenses with that occurred. So we expected some of that to occur in the second quarter. As we can see, a lot of the events, which Mastercard sponsors, didn't necessarily come to fruition because of the pandemic in the second quarter. We're now expecting for that to happen in the third quarter. And so like I said, I kind of think about that more in terms of the shift in operating expenses between the second and the third quarter. On your question on rebates and incentives. It's really a function of \u2013 we go into a quarter. We think about what our expectations on rebates and incentives based on what new and renewed deals we might be entering into. And really, I think the lower rebates and incentives relative to our expectations in the second quarter is a function of what actually ends up closing in a given quarter relative to what our expectations were. So like I said, we do expect that there will be an uptick in our rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross in the third quarter on account of new deals, which we expect to occur in the third quarter. Hey, Craig, it's Sachin. So as relates to where our services revenue reside, they are \u2013 for the most part, reside between other revenues and our transaction processing fees. It depending on the nature of the service, a, either comes into other revenues. And there is some amount which comes in transaction processing fees to the extent they are related to the number of transactions which are switched. You kind of asked the question as to what services are helping us differentiate and win at the core, I would argue that it's \u2013 if you start from what Michael said earlier, which is ability to gain access to data, utilizing data to analyze and provide advice to our clients as to how they can optimize their portfolios, how they can end up growing their top line while still managing their expense base is a key enabler on one side. And then separate from that, a pain point which exists, which is around fraud, is another area, which where our \u2013 and our cyber intelligence capabilities are a key differentiating factor. And Lisa, you can see the effort of both organic and inorganic build that we've been trying to do in that space. The organic build was the tokens and the investment that went into developing the idea and building these capabilities. And the inorganic build includes Ethoca, RiskRecon and other such efforts. And then the organic expenses on those to help them expand their reach. So it's kind of a combination of that, that come into our system. And that's the discipline we follow on our acquisitions. And for a couple of years, we tell you that this is ex-acquisition. And then after that, it's in our base because that is how it has to be. Hey Tien-tsin, it's Sachin. So yes, you're seeing the spread take place in the second quarter between what you would expect in terms of a greater decline in credit and actually pretty good growth in debit. I would tell you that some of the second quarter numbers are impacted by the stimulus programs, right? So as more and more money gets deposited in people's bank accounts, they're utilizing the debit product to go and access that amount. Correct. And so I do think you're seeing a little bit of that impact come through. But by and large, if you just step back and you think about where we are from an economic standpoint, given the uncertainty in the economy, people tend to rely more on a debit product than they do on credit, right? And kind of \u2013 the reality is, we're well-positioned to capitalize on both those trends, i.e., the fact that people are accessing their stimuli funds through debit products. But also the fact that our strength in debit, I mean we go on a global basis and you think about our presence in debit globally, we stand well-positioned to take advantage of that situation as people spend more on the debit product. So look, I can't tell you where it's going to go. What I can tell you is we're seeing a little bit bump up in terms of our debit growth rates in the second quarter driven by the stimulus program. Yes. Sure. Hey Sanjay, so on the comment around the week of July 21, it's just exactly like I said. Look, I mean, let's not put too much until the week of July 21 because what I'm seeing in the early numbers for the week of July 28 is actually seeing back to the trends we were seeing on the week of July 14. In other words, the growth levels we were seeing back in the week of July 14. What you did have is the impact in the third week of July related to the tougher year-over-year comps on account of some promotional activities done by e-commerce merchants. But I wouldn't put too much more into that. The trajectory is a good solid growth trajectory, which we've been seeing here. On your question about impact of the back and forth in terms of pauses and reopenings taking place in different parts of the world and different parts of the country, I would just say we continue to run the business based on the full framework, which we've got, the whole containment stabilization, normalization and growth. And the reality is it's going to be non-linear. We are going to see puts and takes, which will take place. But when I look at it on a holistic basis, if I look at the most recent numbers for the fourth week of July, we're seeing the growth trajectory is on the second week of July. Mike, do you want to take the cross border? It's Sanjay, I'll just add to what Michael just said. I mean we should think about border restrictions even in the context of U.S. and Canada and U.S. with Mexico, right? I mean we typically think border restrictions that we are thinking for Europe. But to the extent border restrictions are lifted between the Canada and the U.S., the U.S. and Mexico, important corridors, by the way, from a cross-border travel standpoint, those are good things for us to have. Secondly, the travel bubbles, which are being created across various corridors, as you think about in Asia-Pacific, between Australia and New Zealand, between China and Singapore, as those start to come into effect, we're going to see probably some of the impact of that come through. I don't know when. But I think those are things to keep your eye on as well. Yes. Let me start on that, and then Ajay can chime in. So on the services side, when you look at the different elements that we have in our portfolio \u2013 so here is starting off with cyber, there's an immediate need. So from a customer demand perspective, there is a pull. So in terms of this help is needed right now, there isn't any debate. And that makes it fairly easy from a cycle perspective. Most of our solutions other than what we call generally network delivered. So that is relatively straightforward for us to switch on such a capability and make a difference. At the other end of the spectrum would be strategy and consulting projects, which involve potentially some travel. And here, we've had some impact, those of sales cycles take longer. The demand is lesser because people are worrying more about it today versus the day after tomorrow. So that's what I would say where we are on that. We see it, the scaling for the network delivered stuff is good. The people delivered stuff, we'll continue to engage. And we do believe, as I said earlier before, being a partner, the best possible partner that we can be in the crisis, let's say, with our data analytics, test-and-learn platform or our cyber platforms, make us a good partner for the longer-term things as we go out of this. Governments, for example, they're looking at longer-term strategy products. Open banking is an opportunity like that. At any given point in time, there's a whole set of services and engagements around real-time payments, and we expect those to really pick up over time. Yes. And Dave, to your question around card growth, we're seeing growth across both credit and debit. There's a little bit stronger growth across debit, and you should expect that. And the reason you should expect that is just general propensity to spend on debit. But also all the work that we are doing as a company, on the migration from Maestro to Debit Mastercard. And that kind of quarter-over-quarter, you are going to see that come through in our schedules, where you see there's a declining card park of Maestro cards relative to what's there in the debit Mastercard side. The only other thing I'll just add is, I think you're all very well aware about the risk management practices, which are there at Mastercard. We have very robust risk management practices, and those have actually held us in pretty good stead in this instance as well. So we monitor, we've got real-time engagement taking place in terms of seeing what kind of traffic is going through our network, as well as put in the requisite collateral measures as and when necessary to ensure that we're appropriately covered."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thanks, Ajay. As Ajay mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a series of significant behavioral changes across consumers, merchants and businesses to having a profound impact on payment preferences, many of which are likely to persist beyond COVID. Key trends include a preference for contactless, the rapid adoption of e-commerce and increased aversion to cash, a merchant requirement to omni-channel acceptance and a need to automate B2B payments. Each of these provide an opportunity for our business to accelerate the secular shift to digital forms of payment. Let me give you some examples. So let's start with the consumer. According to our latest COVID-19 consumer impact study, over 70% of consumers plan to continue or increase their online purchasing and approximately 60% believe they will use less cash even after the pandemic subsides. And we are providing digital-first solutions that leverage our tokenization and other digital technologies to meet these changing needs. In addition to the success we've had in the digital space with companies like Apple, we recently announced an expanded partnership with Samsung, which includes the digital-first Samsung Money by SoFi product here in the U.S. and the Samsung Pay card with Curve in the UK Southeast Asian super app Grab has launched a digital-first Mastercard prepaid card in the Philippines and the partnering with emerging fintechs like C24 in Germany, for the Mastercard debit solution and tied in the UK to provide a new commercial prepaid product. In addition, click to pay, the streamline industry-wide guest checkout capability continues to gain momentum as consumers shift to digital experiences. More than 10,000 merchants have been enabled in the U.S. and preparations for global expansion are underway. We are differentiating our click to pay offering through an additional layer of security enabled by new data, AI and machine learning technology and through push provisioning of consumer enrollment through banks like Citi, which will help to speed up and ease consumer adoption. Another implication of the shift to e-commerce is the need to support merchants with digital-enablement solutions. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent about 90% of businesses worldwide, have an acute need in this area as they recover from the impact of pandemic. As part of our $250 million commitment to support small business globally, we have recently launched our Digital Doors initiative, which provides gateway, cybersecurity and other resources for merchants to quickly establish an online presence and start accepting electronic payments. We're also providing a comprehensive suite of installment capabilities through API-based solutions, partnerships and acquisitions, all of which provide greater choice in lending solutions for merchants and consumers, both online and in-store, which is particularly important in a credit challenged post-COVID environment. Our Mastercard installment solution has been available market-wise for several years. Our acquisition of Vyze allowed us to advance our presence with marquee merchants in the U.S. And internationally, we forged partnerships with Pine Labs, Afterpay, [indiscernible] to provide tailored regional solutions. In addition, we recently announced a new partnership with Splitit to provide interest-free installments for e-commerce purchases. Now while the pandemic has accelerated consumer adoption of digital payment solutions, the crisis has also driven increased demand for our services offerings, including cybersecurity and data analytics capabilities. These services allowed to offer differentiated solutions that are valued by a wide variety of customer segments and provide us with a level of revenue diversification. This has become particularly evident in the COVID environment as our services lines grew much faster than the core in the second quarter. Digital commerce continuously requires more advanced cyber solutions. In anticipation of that, we have been scaling our capabilities both organically and inorganically. Our RiskRecon acquisition, for instance, helps ecosystem participants assess and approve cybersecurity, and it is being utilized by several governments, health care providers and leading tech firms. Our Ethoca solutions are scaling quickly. We continue to have strong partners like Bank of America, and our Ethoca digital receipts product has been enabled at more than 18 new merchants over the last few months. New Data, which provides behavioral biometrics capabilities has secured new partnerships with Jack Henry & Associates as well as others. In addition to cyber, our customers are leveraging our data and analytics capabilities to assess, plan and react to the pandemic. Our test and learn platform, powered by our acquisition of APT, is helping partners like Citi to supplement their planning processes. In addition, we have engaged with governments in over 100 data analytics, cybersecurity and disbursement programs in over 30 markets around the world since the crisis began. And finally, our services capabilities provided key elements of differentiation to help us win several deals this quarter. We renewed key consumer partnerships with [indiscernible] Bank in the U.S., Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in UAE, Santander in Mexico and a credit renewal with the Bank of China. On the commercial side, we signed a deal with P&C in the U.S. and established a partnership with Virgin Money in the UK. In addition to our efforts in digital and services, I'd like to touch on a few of our initiatives to address a broader set of payment flows and opportunities. Let's begin with open banking. As the shift to a digital economy accelerates, demand for open banking services will increase further. In Europe, our open banking connects protect and resolve solutions, which we launched last year continue to gain traction. We've added new fintech players like Modulr, DiPocket and Aion, in addition to the recently announced Tesco win. And we are excited about the planned acquisition of Finicity, which advances our open banking strategy here in North America and which we will leverage globally. This will enable a new round of innovation and inclusion in financial services and new products for consumers. Finicity brings best-in-class connectivity with thousands of U.S. banks, along with a robust set of applications, including credit decisioning and account owner verification capabilities, but we're also attracted to Finicity's approach to open banking, including their strong commitment to data privacy and transparency, their balanced ecosystem model and their focus on API-based connectivity, all of which are consistent with our principles in the open banking space. We expect the deal to close by the end of the year and believe that the combination of Finicity and our internally developed solutions will provide us with a differentiated set of capabilities. Shifting gears to B2B. Recent research conducted by Carney indicates that COVID has made the digitization of accounts payables and receivable processes a priority from many corporations. We have a commercially launched Mastercard track business payment service. The U.S. launch included 13 distribution partners across the B2B ecosystem, including Global Payments, AvidXchange, Boost Payment Solutions, Fiserv and others. Cross-border payments and international expansion of plan for 2021, talking about cross-border, earlier this week, we announced the partnership with the Bank of Shanghai to allow customers of Mastercard's cross-border services, which is inclusive of our acquisition of Transat and Mastercard Send, to send international B2B payments into China with less friction and more certainty. This is the latest example of how our cross-border services are enabling financial institutions and partners to reach a variety of payment end points in more than 100 markets, whether over card or a counter \u2013 count infrastructure via a single connection. With that, let me now turn the call over to Sachin. Yes, Darrin, it's Michael here. Let me take that. So as you rightly said, there is this accelerated shift to digital, yes, and we see that right now. What does all of that mean for the business overall? Well, first of all, that accelerates the secular shift to digital payments. So that's all fantastic. But it has a downstream impact into our services, for sure. So more digital transactions versus more cash transactions is more data. More data means more desire and more need for data analytics capabilities, but also to protect that data. So our cyber solutions are going to benefit from that in the long run. We've clearly seen that. As long as the underlying trend to digital continues, which we believe it will, our services portfolio, which \u2013 it hits right on to these points should be benefiting. Next question please. Yes. I just have one point to add to that. As we turn out of the COVID pandemic, I was talking earlier about understanding the crisis reacting to it and planning for the future. Our test-and-learn stuff works almost like a hook. The crisis got us engaged on test and learn at a much greater scale than before, and that leads into conversations in more in the BAU realm of our business around payments with our customers. So we talked about planning processes on branch opening and what retailers are doing to stocking their shelves and so forth. But that leads into payment opportunities, which is, again, a way for us to differentiate and win in payments. Now on Finicity. So I have to say from the first interaction that we had with the Finicity team, with the leadership team, with Steve and Nick over there, the founders, we felt a very strong cultural affinity here. So here is a company that has been the leading voice and setting up the FDX, the financial data exchange approach. Transparent business model, a model that works for everybody in open banking, open and that is for fintechs, it's for banks, it's for consumers. They have been a voice in that for years. And that's pretty much exactly where we are going. When you dig a little more into the detail, you see a company that has very strong relationships with U.S. banks. I talked about the connectivity earlier. But they have a series of agreements, data sharing agreements in place with several of the large U.S. banks, Chase, Wells and Capital One, for example. So there is a really good reaction that we got \u2013 once we announced the deal in terms of our banking partners is saying, this is a good partner for you. When it comes to data quality, one of the important things that matters for fintechs and banks alike as well as consumers, is that the data quality of what is being shared here is at the highest point. It is cleansed. It works at all times. And here, Finicity is clearly a leader. The applications that they bring, specifically around credit decisioning makes Finicity a leader. This is something that I believe is a very useful. Use case. It's one that will be needed, certainly as we come out of the crisis. If you think about their boost product, here the company was thinking around financial inclusion for a while. As we have with the boost product, it basically helps people improve their credit score, so they can get access to credit. So all around, I see clear differentiation, of Finicity versus other players that make them, as far as I can see, our best possible partner. Hey, Lisa, it's Michael here. So let me take this question. As you rightly said, we talked about it earlier. We see fraud rates increasing, more transaction happening digitally. So there's no surprise there. Our broad strategy is along a number of pillars. We want to prevent fraud to start with. As and when transactions occur, we want to ensure that authentication as best as possible. We want to help our customers assess their cybersecurity status to start with. So those are the key dimensions of our strategy. But here you pointed to an important aspect here. The underlying components of the digital economy, like tokenization that we have invested so much effort in over the last couple of years, come to play here. And tokens can do many things. But for once they \u2013 what they do is, because it's a onetime token, this, a compromise transaction cannot be used by anybody for anything else. So what it does is it makes it safer, but it also drives a great user experience because the approval rates are going to be higher. So that effort is paying off significantly. So we keep expanding our capabilities here with RiskRecon. I talked about cybersecurity readiness. That is \u2013 we can run fast enough right now. There's \u2013 everybody's seeking all those merchants that are coming online these days, trying to establish an online business. We see great demand for that. And then, of course, once transactions happen, and there might be faulty transactions of some sort, the whole charge back process comes into site and here as an ecosystem leader as a custodian of the payments ecosystem. We're putting out our solutions to help making chargeback solutions. Go away even before, a chargeback is actually filed. That's what Ethoca does for us. So around about, I think we're quite well positioned here. But tokens, as you said, make a real big difference. All right. Let's go open banking first. Meanwhile, I can think about this question in the back of my mind. All right. Open banking. So open banking is in the end all about putting control into the hands of a consumer to use their data, in this case, the data in their bank accounts to get access to better financial services just generally benefit from the data. So that's the whole principle. Our strategy is, when you look at this ecosystem that's opening up here, is you got a lot of fintechs out there, third-party providers that are coming in and wanting to provide such financial services, and there's a lot of banks that hold that data. So we believe there's a role for us to be a trusted party in the middle between the fintechs and the banks and all that based on consumer content to provide seamless transactions and make sure that everybody is a good player and enables the consumer to benefit from their data. So that's broadly the strategy. We have built those solutions in Europe. We brought them to market last year, Connect, Protect, Resolve. I talked about it earlier. Good progress there. 11 countries, 2,000 banks on that works really well in Europe. And then here in North America, there's a market that grew up in a different way, not driven by regulatory pushes in Europe. But basically, incumbents are there that having slightly different models on providing such services to consumers. We looked at Finicity here, as I laid out earlier, a good fit for us. That will be our starting point in North America to assume that trusted raw between fintechs and banks. In the end, what I see is us participating in data transactions or in payment transactions, both will happen in the world of open banking. And as we participate in car transaction and build a portfolio of value-add services on top of that, it makes those transactions better and differentiated from Mastercard, as we seek to do the same in open banking. So in terms of open banking applications, I'll give you an example out of our world of loyalty services, our pay with rewards API, that would be something that we seek to deploy to the fintechs that are participating in the open banking ecosystem. There might be a neo-bank that says, I want to have a pay with rewards capability and here's a premium API from Mastercard. And of course, around all of this is everybody is trying to figure out their open banking strategy, it's a great opportunity for our consulting business for advisers. So infrastructure, application services is the way that we think about a go-to-market. And I think with our organic stuff and Finicity, we have the tools that we need. Now that gave me just two minutes to think about the colorful question. So you know what? We have been since this whole pandemic started, basically locked up together for the last 4.5 months here in purchase. Extended family, I would say. And I first found out all the things I don't want to be like. And there's a few. No. But in all seriousness, when you look at our strategy, hope, we're doing in terms of the accelerated drive to digital economy, we've got to just be on that and maximize that as much as we can. But at the same time, I just do want to make the point that we do see, even in these four months, consumer behavior is changing. Yes, people are using more digital services, but also when there is an opportunity to go back on the Street and buy at that local shopper around the corner, then they do that. So the good thing is we have a business that benefits from the trend from cash to contactless and cards, and we will continue to drive that as hard as a digital partner. And that gives us the two legs to stand on. And then there's services. I think there's a huge opportunity, Lisa's question. We just talked about it in terms of what else we can do the longer-term trend linked to underlying digital data flowing through. And in places like open banking, we haven't touched on it. New payment flows, B2B, real-time payments, all that. I don't see a dramatic change to our strategy because even those are just early steps on where we are. The turban thing, that would basically mean I need to get up like an hour earlier to buying the whole thing. But I don't want to. Yes. On the cross-border side, so interesting question, just picking up from what Sachin just said. So the full phase framework, what we put in there is, we believe we will see normalization on a path to growth, once social distancing measures and border restrictions are released. So the point about a vaccine will be a good thing to have and medicine will be a good thing to have. But it's \u2013 I don't think that we'll see flat travel until that point. We're already starting to see border restrictions being eased in some parts of the world. Europe, for example, there are some early green shoots there. People do get into their cars and drive across borders. We see domestic travel around the world happening. So once border restrictions are lifted, we will see some increase there. So that is the first step. Then you go into therapeutics and vaccines. So just to come back in a big way, I think you're right. But it's not going to be kind of like an L where it all happens at one point. It will be a gradual improvement. Yes. Just a few things to add on that. When you look at Europe, maybe Western Europe comes to mind, but we see a huge opportunity for cash displacement in Eastern Europe. That's been driving our growth there, so that will continue. And then there's countries in the middle. Like Germany, which was cash heavy, and COVID has clearly accelerated the trend there. And definitely, at least with my cross-border e-commerce. No, but the point here is the contactless is rising. So here's a market that is a significant opportunity that's, again, rising the wave. To Ajay's point, we are partnering with all the local schemes here, bringing our best practices to bear. So Europe, I continue to see non-cash displacement on differentiation services and opportunity across the board. You too."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your presenter today, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations, Warren Kneeshaw. Please go ahead, sir.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you and your families and coworkers are all safe. With me today are Ajay Banga, our Chief Executive Officer; Michael Miebach, our President; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay, Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. Due to the length of our prepared comments today, we plan to allow for an additional 15 minutes for questions, if necessary. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.\nAjay Banga: Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody. Our first quarter started off strong and kind of continuing to build off the solid trends and performance that we had in 2019. But as you all know, as the pandemic developed and spread, it impacted our first quarter performance, but the strength in our services-related revenues shows that the strategy we have perused over the last decade to diversify our revenue streams is paying off. Now, this virus has created a truly extraordinary challenge that we need to address together. And like everyone else, we're trying to do our part. Post the execution of our grow, diversify and build strategy, we've built on the solid foundation of our technology, data, brand and our wonderful people. That's put us in the fortunate position of being able to support our clients and partners throughout this difficult period. And you will hear me and Michael and Sachin talk more about this later. At it's core, this is a health crisis and therefore the public health response is the most important policy response in the near-term. It is the critical first step to getting the world's economies back on track. And as we've all been reading, coordinated efforts, such as the sustained implementation of social distancing and the scaling of our healthcare capacity to address increasing needs are having a positive effect. The company over the middle and longer terms will be dependent on the implementation of successful testing processes and the development of effective prophylactics, therapeutics and vaccines. Now, we are contributing through our investment in the Therapeutics Accelerator together with The Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust. In the mean time, fiscal stimulus packages are being introduced across many markets and this will be a critical effort to provide relief during the downturn for individuals, to small businesses and for others who are particularly hard hit. We're also seeing very strong efforts of monetary policy across a number of countries, which would be particularly supportive as the recovery takes hold. Ultimately, the shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of these policy initiatives. But again in the mean time, we are helping out. We've joined forces with Onward U.S., a coalition of tech partners and foundations that are addressing displaced workers across the United States. Definitely, we are providing necessary resources to support the unique needs of small businesses with a commitment of $250 million in technology, product and insight assets, as well as philanthropic support. Now, let me shift gears for a moment to tell you how we are looking at this on the ground. We have spent some time together as a team on developing a framework that really helps the entire company. Think about the progression through four distinct phases, containment, stabilization, normalization and growth. Containment of the mitigation initiatives like travel restrictions and social distancing and work from home orders are implemented by public authority in an effort to bend the curve and contain the growth in new COVID cases. From our perspective, from a payment volume perspective, this phase is characterized by rapid contraction in spending levels. Portfolios of stabilization where these mitigation initiatives are by and large complete and spending stabilizes around a new lower level due to mobility limitations with a focus on buying necessities and, of course, aided by e-commerce. We believe we are currently in the stabilization phase in most markets. The next phase is normalization, where governments gradually relax mitigation practices and the environment becomes safer for the citizenry, enabled by the broader availability of testing and tracing and improved therapeutics even before the rollout of an effective vaccine. This phase we think will be characterized by a gradual path to recovery in spending to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate spending will begin to rebound during this phase, but not necessarily evenly. We would expect some sectors, particularly where there is pent-up demand, like home improvement, or clothing, or healthcare, or domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize earlier. Other areas like mass entertainment and long-haul travel will probably take longer to recover. It's possible that we will see early signs of normalization in some sectors and geographies throughout the rest of this year. And the final phase is growth, where spending levels gradually trend higher than pre-COVID levels. We believe a widely available vaccine and proven therapeutics will help to bring this change to fruition. So containment, stabilization, normalization and growth is the framework we are using. It's not necessarily linear, as we've seen in Japan and Singapore recently and frankly it's impossible to say how long this fans will last. We think this framework makes sense. We are running this business with this common lexicon across the company. You will hear us talk about progress in these terms as we move forward. Now, bringing all this back to our business. It is clear that our metrics are being impacted, you've seen those, but our business drivers are rooted in more than just PCE trends. The secular shift from cash and check to electronic forms of payment is important and we expected to accelerate coming out of this crisis. We have worked hard to grow a balanced portfolio across credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments with a focus on strengthening share in debit and prepaid, which tend to be more resilient in times like this. We've also diversified our business in terms of our customer base and geographies as demonstrated with our presence around the globe. Now, our services lines, a significant portion of which are not linked to transaction levels, they help us to further diversify our revenue stream and they are very much in demand. All this on a foundation of a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which allows us to execute on our strategy to capture new payment flows and build new capabilities for the long-term, organically, of course, but also importantly inorganically. The near-term will no doubt look different than we expected it to be just three months ago, but we're very well positioned to make the most of these significant opportunities that we see coming our way. So, now, let me turn to what we are doing to address the situation today. Normally, and like every other time, we are focusing on the things that we can control both inside our company, but also externally with our customers, governments and society at large. Let me start with the most important issue, the health and well-being of our employees. Our offices remain open wherever they have been allowed to do so, but the vast majority of our employees are working from home. Many people are dealing with new circumstances and unexpected challenges. We are helping our employees in every which way that we can. We're providing them with additional health benefits, take time off for those in need to care for themselves or their loved ones. We have assured our employees that there will be no COVID-19-related layoffs this year. Our network and systems remain fully operational based on the resilient core infrastructure that we have built and have regularly tested. We are helping our customers mitigate risk as well, we are engaging with them in scenario planning. we're leveraging AI tools, financial institutions and others to help them fortify their business continuity plans as they navigate the downturn to ensure that they can come out strong on the other side. And we're also reaching out beyond our four walls to support governments, much of we\u2019ve worked over them in the past with an increased focus on their specific needs in light of today's pandemic crisis. We are uniquely positioned to help them provide emergency payments to both people and businesses through our multirail solutions. We are facilitating specific COVID-related social disbursement programs around the world, reaching millions of some of the hardest hit people, including in the United States through the Direct Express prepaid program or account-to-account rails, which enable about 90% of payroll and support, almost all state benefit payments in the U.K. and now also being leveraged to support payments to displaced workers and financial assistance to businesses in that market. And we're involved in work like this in markets as diverse as Israel and Chile. So there's a lot going on, but we're always thinking about what more we can do. So before we move on, let me just say, we will get through this. I have tremendous confidence in the ability of mankind to find innovative solutions in the face of difficult circumstances. And then confidence returns and it will. We expect the fundamental growth trends that have driven the company will return in force. We have a resilient business model that benefit from diversification, that benefits from our ability to optimize existing products and solutions and benefits by the fact that we can introduce new value prop, all of which contribute to our ability to grow over the longer term. So with that, I'm going to turn this call over to Michael, who, as you know, has all the operating teams reporting to him. And I think I'm very fortunate to have him working side-by-side with me, as we've navigated through this unique time together. So, Michael?\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Ajay. Likewise. Yes, these are clearly difficult times, which is why we're leaning in, leaning in with our customer to be the best partner we can possibly be, especially now as we work through the containment and stabilization phases together and compare for normalization and ultimately growth. We're staying closely connected and anticipating the needs of banks, merchants, governments, fintechs as well as the end consumers, while executing on our strategic priorities, driving a secular shift to electronic payments, building new revenue streams and capturing new payment flows, diversifying our customer base and geographic reach. All these have been critical parts of our strategy and they will continue to be key enablers driving our success coming out of this crisis. All of this while remaining agile on how we manage expenses to ensure long-term growth. So let me take each of these three in turns to give you an idea on how we are doing this. First off, the secular shift. Now with trillions of dollars of payments still being made by cash and check despite our best efforts, there's clearly an opportunity to drive new transactions to our products, both online and in store. We've seen a dramatic increase in e-commerce in this time of low mobility and we expect some of these behaviors to persist going forward. When we look at our switched volumes in April, card not present accounts for over 50% of volume, which is up from 40% last year. So our drive to offer our customers expanded digital capabilities online and in app is increasingly important and we are doubling down on these efforts. For example, by leveraging our Payments Gateway services, merchants are able to accept digital payments securely and easily.  And our Simplify Commerce platform makes it easy for small and medium-sized businesses to set e-commerce options up within just a few days, which of course matters more now than ever. Underlying these digital transactions, our tokenization capabilities, which enable safe and secure purchases across every digital channel and bring benefits like improved approval rates, again, really matters us today. We have new commitments with FC in the U.S. and large e-commerce retailers such as JD.com from China to tokenize the cards on file. Now in store, contactless is the fastest, easiest and safest and as of late as announced by the WHO the healthiest way to pay and is a key driver in the conversion of cash to electronic payments, especially now with consumers looking for a quick way to get in and out of stores without exchanging cash, touching terminals or anything else. We have seen over 40% growth in contactless transactions worldwide in the first quarter. Our recent consumer insights indicate that habits are being created today. It will last beyond the current situation, more than half of new tappers are saying they will continue to use contactless once this pandemic is over. And we are helping to enable this by increasing contactless limits around the globe. And in our conversations with banks, we see a renewed commitment to accelerate the issuance of new contactless cards. Now, moving on to the growth pillar. We continue to win important credit, debit, prepaid and commercial deals around the globe. Let me give you just a few recent examples, including our expanded partnership with Sberbank in Russia, an expanded global commercial agreement with Brex including new products and services. We also extended our long-term relationship with Banco Inter in Brazil in the consumer and commercial credit space. And Afterpay has agreed to make Mastercard its preferred commercial prepaid and issuer processing partner. In the U.S., downloading will be moving its commercial card business over to us, including T&E and purchasing cards as well as the new virtual card program. And I'm really pleased to announce that we've won credit and debit programs with Live Oak Bank, a significant provider of small business loans in the U.S., again, very important in these times. I'd like to come back to the debit trend that Ajay mentioned. We've increased our consumer debit share globally over time and our lead - and are leaders in a number of markets such as Brazil, India and several markets in Continental Europe. We believe that this along with our global leadership in prepaid will serve us really well in the current environment and of course beyond. Further, we have products like digital debit, which enable issuers to offer their customers credentials that can be used online, even when their current cards don't have these capabilities. We have several examples this quarter. Most notably, the cooperatives banks in Germany are working exclusively with Mastercard to enable more than 20 million customers with access to digital card - debit cards. Let's shift the focus to our diversification strategy. Now, we continue to make good progress in expanding our customer base, particularly with fintechs, where we moved early and we've developed a leadership position. Some examples of recent wins include a new prepaid co-brand program with Credit Sesame in the U.S. and expanded relationship with N26, otherwise known as N sechsundzwanzig around 80 markets around the globe. Now, on to diversifying geographies. As you all know, we have been looking forward to switching domestic transactions in China. We're really pleased to have received the preliminary approval for our license application, which will allow us to set up our JV with our local partners in UCC. We expect this process will play out over the next year. Now, this takes us to the build pillar of our strategy. As you know, we've made a concerted effort to invest through a combination of organic and inorganic means to build new revenue streams. This has not only accelerated our growth, but also diversified our revenue, which is particularly valuable in these times and will continue to be important over the long run. First off, services. Our services lines are holding up well, despite the downturn as a significant portion are not linked to transaction levels. So let me bring this to life for you. For example, our customers are using our differentiated insights and analytics to help them assess, react and plan during the current crisis. Now, we have implemented our unique test and learn capabilities acquired through our APT acquisition a few years ago to address industry-specific needs. Here's an example this could be engagements like working with grocers on inventory levels and promotions in real-time and many more use cases. We're also working to address frauds, which is even more important as more transactions are moving online. The capabilities that we have acquired through companies like NuData, Brighterion, Ethoca and most recently RiskRecon help us bring significant value to the ecosystem and will continue to position us well as behaviors are likely to shift in the post-COVID-19 world. With RiskRecon, we are providing cyber vulnerability assessments for small businesses and healthcare organizations and Ethoca of issuers and merchants prevent fraud before it even occurs. And it helps to reduce costs and the operational burden of charge back resolution. This breadth of our cyber intelligence services allows us to assist even beyond payments, as we are doing by creating a digital identity framework. And finally, here are a couple of updates on our progress in new payment flows and real-time payments, in particular. Our real-time payments implementations are progressing as planned, including in the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and in the Nordics with P27. I do want to point out that our account-to-account rails are particularly resilient in times like these, given the breadth of use cases to address and the recurring nature of these payments. In the U.K. alone, we process more than 2 billion real-time transactions annually, which are growing at double-digits over our account-to-account rails. And as you know, we're involved in account-to-account rails in many more companies - countries around the world. Now, as you would expect, the social distancing measures are pushing more day-to-day activities like person-to-person payments and home delivery services to digital platforms, which in turn use Mastercard Send. We continue to see very strong volume growth here. Even with the slowdown in some aspects of the weak economy like ride-sharing, strong growth persists. We have also seen strong growth across our cross-border assets, including Transfast. There's momentum in both, in P2P flows and in B2C flows of disbursement use cases, including as of late with First Abu Dhabi Bank, which has gone live with cross-border account-to-account remittances. And over to the open banking front, we continue to rollout a set of comprehensive solutions and services that we believe work for all players in the ecosystem. Further to our efforts in Europe that we launched last year, I'm very excited that we will be expanding our longstanding relationship with Tesco to work with them on open banking, which is particularly notable, given the U.K. is a leading market in this space. We see the ability to facilitate the exchange of real-time information, while protecting data privacy as a significant opportunity for us and as the landscape evolves and open banking makes its way around the world. With all of this as a backdrop, we are actively managing our expenses. As the situation developed, we quickly advanced the framework for prioritizing our spending with a focus on how to best support our customers and drive the long-term interests of the company. We looked at each expense line and made adjustments based on factors, such as market readiness and customer demand. At the same time, we have preserved our ability to invest in strategically important areas, such as digital, services, geographic expansion and the enormous opportunities we see in real-time payments. And these are critical to our long-term growth. The flexibility in our model enables us to adapt quickly and adjust as circumstances warrant, we will continue to manage this closely. For more detail on expense management and our financials overall, let me now turn the call over to Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks Michael. As Ajay and Michael mentioned, this truly is an unprecedented time for us all. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the resiliency of the team here at Mastercard. We have maintained their focus in supporting our business, our customers and partners and each other during this challenging period. In light of the current circumstances, I will focus most of my comments today on the trends that we have seen recently, but I will start by walking you through our Q1 results. So turning to page three, here are a few highlights on a currency-neutral basis and excluding both special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue grew 5% with acquisitions contributing approximately 1 ppt to this growth. Total operating expenses increased 8%, which includes a 6 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Operating income grew by 2% and net income was up 3%, both of which include a 3 ppt reduction due to acquisitions. EPS grew 6% year-over-year to $1.83, which includes $0.05 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock. Let's turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter, each of which was impacted by the pandemic starting in February and March. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 8% on a local currency basis and was favorably impacted by an additional processing day due to the leap year, has partially offset the declines due to the pandemic. U.S. GDV grew 6%, down approximately 3 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 9% down 5 ppt from last quarter. Cross-border volume growth was approximately 15% through January, driven by double-digit growth in most regions, but began to decline progressively through February and March as travel restrictions were put in place globally. This resulted in overall cross-border volume decreasing by 1% for the quarter on a local currency basis. I will get into more detail on the trends we are seeing in a moment. Turning to page five, switched transaction growth was approximately 20% through February, reflecting the strong recent trend supported in part by the ongoing adoption of contactless. We then saw declines in March, as stay at home practices were implemented, which resulted in growth of 13% globally for the quarter. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's turn to page six for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 5% net revenue increase was primarily driven by transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in our services offerings, partially offset by a decrease in cross-border volume and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 8% in line with the 8% growth in worldwide GDV. Cross-border volume fees decreased 2%, while cross-border volume decreased 1%. The 1 ppt difference is mainly driven by mix. Transaction processing fees grew 16%, while switched transactions grew 13%, the 3 ppt difference is primarily driven by the strength in services, partially offset by mix. Other revenues were up 28%, including a 6 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions, which held up well this quarter. Finally, rebates and incentives increased 26%, reflecting recent deal activity, as anticipated. If you look at rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues, you will see that they increased sequentially to 35% this quarter reflecting recent deal activity and the impact of the amortization of fixed incentives over a smaller gross revenue base. Moving on to page seven, you can see that on a currency-neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses increased 8%. This includes a 6 ppt increase related to acquisitions, partially offset by a 3 ppt benefit related to the differential in hedging gains and losses versus the year ago period. The remaining 5 ppt of growth related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives, such as digital enablement, safety and security, geographic expansion and new payment flows. Now turning to page eight and given the circumstances, I thought it would be worthwhile to update you on where we stand from a capital allocation standpoint. As you may recall, our capital allocation priorities are to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest for the long-term growth of our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and migrate our capital structure towards a more normalized mix of debt and equity over time. And these priorities have not changed. Despite the impact of COVID-19 through the strength of our business model and prudent expense discipline, we have generated strong operating cash flows in Q1. This strong operating cash flow, the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program and the $4 billion of debt that we raised in the first quarter further strengthened our liquidity position. At the end of the first quarter, we had $10.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We believe that maintaining a strong liquidity position is the prudent thing to do, given the current economic environment. It gives us tremendous flexibility to not only meet our obligations, but to also capitalize on new organic and inorganic opportunities that may present themselves in this environment. We have deals in the pipeline that we are examining actively, as you would expect at a time like this. Lastly, as it relates to the share buyback program, we will reevaluate this as macroeconomic visibility improves and will opportunistically execute on the program as we have historically done. Now, turning to page nine, let's discuss what we've seen through March and the first three weeks of April from an operating metrics standpoint. We are providing additional detail here to help you better understand the recent trends. Essentially, what you see is that through March, we were in the containment phase, with cross-border volumes and domestic spending declining as travel restrictions were implemented, followed by social distancing measures being put in place across various jurisdictions. The rates of decline have recently stabilized as these restrictions have taken hold indicating early signs of the stabilization phase. It is important to point out that social distancing measures have been implemented at different times and to different degrees around the globe and even within countries. So, not every location is in the same phase. Part of Asia moved first, followed by much of the developed world in March, and the balance in the last few weeks. So looking at this a little bit more closely, let's start with switched volumes, where you can see the impacts of the social distancing measures on overall spending, starting progressively in March. The impacts have varied by category with spending on essentials, such as groceries, pharmaceuticals and utilities holding up pretty well. Spending on items that are either discretionary or require mobility are down significantly. This includes categories, such as travel, restaurants, clothing, recreation and gas. We have also seen people deploy healthcare services other than those related to COVID-19. Not surprisingly the way in which people have been making purchases has shifted, specifically as Michael mentioned earlier, card not present spend now accounts for over 50% of switched volume in April, up from about 40% in 2019 as e-commerce spend excluding travel has actually grown. We have also seen merchants accelerate their omnichannel distribution efforts, most notably in restaurants and department stores to accommodate the shift. In total, switched volumes at levels are down approximately 25% versus year ago in recent weeks, indicating early signs of the stabilization phase that Ajay alluded to. The third week of April numbers have actually improved across all regions, perhaps in part due to the early impact of fiscal stimulus, but it's still early days. We are seeing the stabilization continue over the last several days as well. Looking forward, as social distancing measures are relaxed, we expect that some of the sectors that have been hardest hit will begin to show signs of normalization. Early signals will include spending on gas as people return to work and spending on deferred needs, such as health and personal care. We expect some sectors, particularly where there is pent-up demand, such as clothing, home improvement and domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize earlier. Other areas will take longer to respond. For instance, long-haul travel spending and mass entertainment. Trends in switched transactions are similar to what we are seeing in switched volumes, as they are impacted by the same factors for the most part. We are seeing an increase in the use of contactless and card present transactions, supported in part by the increased spending limits that we have facilitated around the world. We think this trend will continue. Turning now to page 10, I would like to provide a little bit - little more color on the cross-border trends we have seen recently. In total, if you look at the gray line, cross-border volume appears to be leveling off, down approximately 50% year-over-year, again, indicating the early signs of the stabilization phase. However, to get a better understanding of these numbers, the best way to think about cross-border is to split it between card present and card not present. Each accounted for about a half of our cross-border spend last year. Not surprisingly, if you look at the orange line, card present spend dropped significantly as the travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented and has since bottomed at a minimal level. So there is very little room left to see further deterioration. On the other hand, card not present, which is the yellow line of the chart has been more resilient, down approximately 25% in April. However, you should know that this includes significant declines in online travel related spend. So looking at the green line, if you exclude online travel, you can see card not present spend is actually up approximately 20% in April, demonstrating the resiliency of this aspect of cross-border. So in summary, the normalization of cross-border spend is dependent on the relaxation of travel restrictions and returning to the growth phase is dependent on an improvement in consumer confidence that is in turn related to the availability of effective therapeutics and ultimately vaccines. Turning now to page 11 and our outlook going forward. For net revenues, given current uncertainties, we will not be providing a forward view for either the second quarter or the year at this time. We do intend, however, to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics throughout the quarter to help you understand the trends we are seeing. Consistent with this approach, we are also withdrawing our 2019 to 2021 performance objectives at this time and we'll reconsider these as we have better visibility. I do, however, want to make a few additional comments to help you with your modeling. First, with respect to cross-border, inter-regional travel has been more significantly impacted than intra-regional travel in Europe. As a result, an increased percentage of cross-border volume is made up of intra-Europe transactions, which are lower yielding than inter-regional transactions. Second, while some portion of our services revenue are linked to transaction levels, a significant portion of the revenue we generate from services is not. This helps our service lines diversify our company's revenues, something we expect to continue to benefit from over the longer term. Overall, we have seen strong demand for our data analytics and cyber solutions. In the second quarter, we expect services growth will continue to outperform our core products. You should, however, expect the growth rates to come down sequentially in the second quarter, but remain positive overall. These declines are due to the dependence of some of our Cyber & Intelligence services on switched transactions, which we expect to be lower sequentially and the impact of social distancing measures on our ability to execute projects at customer sites, and will impact both the transaction processing and the other revenue lines. We would expect services-related revenues to accelerate, as switched transactions begin to normalize and mobility restrictions are relaxed. Separately, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to continue to increase sequentially, reflecting deal activity and amortization of fixed incentives over a smaller gross revenue base. Now, turning to operating expenses, as Michael mentioned, we are managing expenses carefully to ensure we can invest strategic - in strategically important initiatives. We have ramped up our efforts in this area and now expect operating expenses on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, to decline at a low single-digit rate in Q2 versus a year ago.  Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind to revenue for the quarter and the year. Foreign exchange will be a tailwind to operating expenses to a similar extent. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 ppt to revenue and 6 to 8 ppt to operating expenses for both the second quarter and the year, assuming the transaction with Nets closes in the third quarter. In the other income and expense line, we will now be at a quarterly expense run rate of approximately $100 million, given our recent debt issuance and prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. With respect to tax, you should assume a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year, assuming the geographic mix of the business does not change significantly. Ultimately, as Ajay said, we will get through this. We are seeing early signs of stabilization and the impacts of fiscal stimulus. We are in a very strong position to navigate through this period of uncertainty and emerge well positioned to address the significant opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Sachin. James, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, thanks for taking the questions and especially for the additional detail, hope everyone is well. So wanted to focus on two things. One, if you could talk about the exit rate at April 21st? You know that saw a nice improvement. How much do you think is related to recent stimulus efforts and how sustainable do you think that is or dependent on continued stimulus efforts? And second, when we think about cross-border, I was hoping you could help us understand how much of that, the card not present, non-T&E cross-border spend is related to B2B versus consumer activity. Thanks.\nAjay Banga: Great, thanks. The first part, the part of our fiscal stimulus, while it's tough to exactly figure out what impact that's had, remember that only started to go relatively recently. And remember, that's a fair amount of money in the United States, but outside of the United States, which as you recall 65% of our revenue of 60%-plus comes from outside of the U.S. and the trends when Sachin was speaking were that this third week of April and the continuing trend for the first few days of the next week are global and they're across every region. So I don't know if I could give you a clear answer, but I don't think you can assume that only the fiscal stimulus that's pouring through the system.\nSachin Mehra: Yeah. And Craig, it's Sachin. I'll just quickly add to that back to what Ajay was just saying. Right? So even beyond the week ending April 21, we've seen the same trends continue for the next few days coming into this week. Actually if you look around the globe and you start to see in various countries, where there is a slight relaxation taking place in terms of social distancing measures which were put in place as well as cross-border restrictions which are put in place, we're starting to see a little bit of that stabilization impact come through, for example, in markets like Italy, Germany, Poland, Australia - Austria. We're seeing this come through. And so the point really being that as people start to get out and are getting back to, I wouldn't call it their normal ways, but getting back to being able to move around, we're starting to see that level of spend come through as well. On your second question around cross-border, here is what I'd tell you. That cross-border, card not present excluding travel, that lift you're seeing, which is taking place in the third week of April, there are a few factors which are contributing to this. And you should kind of - just kind of keep that in mind. One is timing of Easter globally is having an impact, but equally if not more important, what we're starting to see is the omnichannel prevalence coming through at various merchants across the globe. So with the crisis hitting, more and more merchants are coming to realize the importance of going into online channels. And as they're going into online channels, they've enabled themselves and they're starting to see the impact of that come through. Other categories where you're seeing some level of spend come through is in areas like clothing, in general retail, I would tell you, in subscription services, in the marketplace activity you're seeing. So you're seeing that come through in all of those metrics there. That's kind of the color I'd like to share with you as it relates to how we are seeing those cross-border trend - card not present trends kind of play out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: I guess, I'm a little bit surprised or is it more variability in the rebates and incentives line with the lower volumes, why isn't there - I know there is - the contracts are structured and there is a little bit of more of an impact on a reduction in the rebates and incentives as volumes decrease. And then secondly just on cross-border and about the higher yields there and how it impacts margins. Maybe you can just give us some thoughts on that as well. Thanks so much and stay safe.\nAjay Banga: Sure. So, Bryan on rebates and incentives, you're well aware about how rebates and incentives are constructed. Right? So there is a variable component and there is a fixed component. And the variable component, which is there moves back and forth based on levels of volumes which are going through the system. The fixed incentives are fixed, they remain fixed. And - so to the extent you're going to see variability is going to be on that variable component. The fixed piece is going to be there. The reality is in the first quarter, you can see from our volumes, we were still growing volumes in the first quarter and you're going to see the impact of that come through. The other aspect you've got to keep in mind is the impact of what I would call new and renewed deals. We had mentioned to you in our prior earnings call that - and you quote about the various deals, which we've kind of entered into, you're seeing the impact of that come through on the rebates and incentives line as well. So really that's what you should kind of keep in mind as to what we're seeing there. Obviously, the variable component will change depending on where volumes ultimately trend out for the rest of the year. The fixed will be what it is. The second question which you've got is around cross-border. I mean, we've tried to provide you as much transparency as we can as it relates to what we're seeing in terms of volume trends. I think the thing to keep in mind in cross-border is there are three different kinds of categories of cross-border. There is what you will think about in the nature of intra-Europe cross-border, where - which is generally lower yielding. Then there is the inter-regional cross-border. And I would break that up into two buckets. The two buckets are there is a long-haul inter-regional stuff and then there's the short-haul inter-regional stuff. And I'd bring that up only because even as you think about how we move from stabilization to normalization, you should think about the fact that you would expect intra-Europe and short-haul inter-regional to come back sooner than normal. And that's just kind of by definition. So for example, if you're in Europe and you can do ground transport between one country and the other country, that would happen more naturally as border restrictions are relaxed and you don\u2019t have - to the various locations. So that's the way you should think about it. From a yield standpoint, intra-Europe low yielding, inter-regional high yielding. So as inter-regional starts to come back, you've got to factor that into the mix in terms of how you\u2019re modeling.\nSachin Mehra: One little comment about margin. I know you asked about cross-border margin, but remember our company has various aspects to its margin mix and one of those which is in - was services, if you remember a few years ago when services were a smaller percentage of our revenue, their margin contribution was also lower and the average margin for our company. That is not the case today. Our services business, all the different lines in it together when you kind of dominate them and look at them, they're very profitable for us as they should be because scale allows us to leverage the fixed cost that we put into building those businesses over a larger volume. So I think as a company, we feel relatively good about where we are on margins. We feel good about some of the revenue diversification. Of course, cross-border is down today and it will be to some extent, as Sachin said, until long-haul intra and inter-regional kind of stuff fix up. That's obvious. And so, we're going to keep doing what we can to keep growing our business in the meanwhile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Really thoughtful presentation. Just to follow-up to Bryan's question that we've incentive line - can we assume that deal activity, that side of it, could there be a pause there here as people saw through the pandemic or could actually accelerate as we see some of your clients embrace contactless and some of your other products? And then somewhat related on the M&A front, it sounds like your appetite is up. Have your priorities changed because of the pandemic or have valuations changed such that you might have more deals in the opportunity set that weren't there before? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So on rebates and incentives, the point really is we're running our business as we would run our business. You know one of our imperatives is to grow market share. We're constantly interacting with our customers. We're going to do deals. We're going to do renew deals. We're going to do new deals. That's just part of course. And so what you're going to see come through is that activity and to the best I've done and the nature of visibility and pipeline and things which are going on, which is a pretty active pipeline, to be completely honest with you, we factor all of that in terms of how we share with you our kind of thoughts around where rebates and incentives will play out.\nAjay Banga: On the M&A side, Tien-Tsin - and hi. It's - let me put it this way. There are a couple of things, which we were looking at even before the pandemic hit. Those conversations are continuing and developing, and that's a good thing. There are others that will come up, I'm sure as we go along. I don't know that you should view us as jumping in just because valuations may go down. I think what's more interesting here is that the willingness of the other parties to be able to feel that they may be in a better home with a company like ours that gives them access to distribution, capabilities, geography and capital and liquidity what creates for a better conversation. I view the valuation comment as interesting, but if all you do is jump and the valuations are down, is that really the kind of acquirer you want to be or do you want to be an acquirer of the right time for the right reason. And I think you will find us trying to find the right balance there and get the deals done for what value they bring to us. So we are keeping our powder dry to be thoughtful at a time like this.\nMichael Miebach: And Tien-Tsin, Michael here. The areas of focus haven't really changed, so we're staying true to the strategy, data analytics, cyber, new payment flows, open banking, those are still top of mind for us as we engage in a manner that Ajay just described.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Glad to hear all your voices, glad everyone is well. Can you, and maybe this is for Ajay or for Michael, talk a little bit about - this is related to cross-border and cross-border travel. As you are in dialogue with governments, your major issuing partners, your major co-brand partners, et cetera, what does the path to long-term recovery and cross-border travel look like like? So in your view, what conditions have to be in place under which you think you'll see both governments be willing to reopen borders and then also people be willing to get back on planes and start traveling? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Hi, Lisa. Nice to hear you guys' voice too. We kind of get a little lonely after this locked up thing here. So, here's the thing. What you're asking is the crux of - a crystal ball issue that's a little difficult to get into. But let me give you some thoughts that I\u2019ve picked over time. The first one is, I actually believe that what you will see that seems is happening in China is you will begin with China I think is in more of a normalization phase than, say the United States and Europe that is more in a stabilization phase. Although, even there, if parts of the U.S. begin to open up as we're hearing some governors speak, you may see a change in that over the next two, three, four, five weeks. I just don't yet know how to predict that well. But let's stick to the idea of with China being in more in the normalization phase than the rest of us. There is a long journey for China through that phase. It's not done, they've just begun. But their local travel has begun. Trains have got bookings. Planes locally have got bookings. Restaurants and bars are open in Shanghai and Beijing and Guangdong and places. Wuhan is still challenged. So, that's - we are learning a little bit from China's experience here. And now you got Australia and New Zealand beginning to think of opening up, so I think we'll get some more data from countries that are a little ahead of the curve than the rest of us. Talking about cross-border travel, China is beginning to talk about corridors of cross-border being opened up, which is to your question about does the government feel comfortable about what kind of connections with certain countries they can reopen. So they're talking about reopening traffic obviously to Hong Kong and Taiwan and Singapore. We're also at a point of time they were thinking about Japan, which has since been a little more challenged, but Japan seems to be improving as well. So I think what you'll find is cross-border travel in corridors or within Europe, which will open first before you get situation of longer haul going. There is the issue of planes having been grounded for quite a while, of crews and planes having to be reactivated. That will also take its own time to come through. The airlines are obviously watching this very carefully and they are very keen to get back on stream, but they need to see some bookings. We know that\u2019s in domestic in the United States, the TSA actually cleared more people through their security systems over the last day or two than they had for the previous couple of weeks. Now, that's at a very low level compared to the peak that we saw prior to the crisis, but that's all indicators of how this will get back into shape. I don't know. My general view in life is that we will probably end up with a reliable therapeutic somewhere over the summer, whether it's available in large enough quantities across the entire world literally for those who are disadvantaged, I don't yet know. So the work that we have seen with The Gates Foundation work and with a bunch of others seems to point in that direction. I suspect the availability of the therapeutic will be some kind of a inflection point in the curve. The fact is that without a real vaccine, can you actually get people confident about getting on to long-haul planes and can you get countries confident for letting people in from another country at that point of time without testing them and quarantining them in their entry point. I don't know, I don't think so. And so to me, that probably is still sometime next year, unless there's a miracle and we find a vaccine earlier, which I don't have good scientific reason to believe. So we're kind of running the company through this stabilization, normalization and growth phase, and we are preparing ourselves to have our expenses and our view of the medium and long-term very focused through these lenses. And I think that's what you'll see us doing. We're pretty confident on what we are trying to do here. We are confident about our deal flow, we're confident about our competitive advantages to keep growing share and working well in debit and working with fintechs and real-time payments and open banking and what we're doing with services and digital analytics and cyber security. So I have a lot of faith in what we're up to, but I don't know how to tell you when cross-border will come back.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. Yes. Fair enough. On a related point just for my follow up that the non-T&E cross-border e-commerce I think is a little bit of a black box at least to us. Can you just comment generally speaking what the composition of that is, like meaning, does it moves and grow in similar ways to domestic e-commerce like non-T&E e-commerce or are there aspects of it that are similar or different like certain regions or certain - is it more media heavy than retail heavy, is there anything unique or comments that you can give about that? Thank you. Thanks a lot guys.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. Sure, Lisa. I'll take that question. Look, I mean, I think first you should recognize that's not an insignificant portion of what the cross-border component is. So it's actually a pretty meaningful portion of the card not present component.\nAjay Banga: We're trying to stay away from giving you a percentage regarding good try. But that is very good try. Very good.\nLisa Ellis: Already doing all the math on the little lines, I am sure you can.\nAjay Banga: Let me give you a little bit of color what that comprises of. Right? I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff, as you would imagine in that, which relates to everything from subscription services, to gaming, to purchases in clothing, appliances, there's all the stuff which kind of sits in that category. So to your point about whether it's more akin to what you would see in card not present in the domestic environment, it's actually some very similar categories would sit in there. The one point I want to make sure that I kind of bring out is we are starting to see a lot of the smaller merchants who were previously not present in the online environment activate themselves to get ready to participate and are actually participating in the online environment. We're starting to see that come through.\nAjay Banga: We do feed in daily life right now, right these are people who never provided food and grocery delivery online are all getting online in the last 3.5, five weeks in the United States alone. And that's a big change from the - that's true for cross-border as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Glad everyone is doing okay. Look, it's I think more than second quarter, which - or even recent trends, which a lot of investors are looking through. It seems clear there has been - there is going to be impacts from this that have a more pronounced impact longer term structurally. And so, can you guys just talk through us, if we think of the benefit - the beneficial opportunities from coming out of this, which may include contactless being more accelerated or use of real-time payments versus the potential for things like cross-border to be maybe structurally changed, what are your thoughts of sort of netting it all out? If you just list up what you are seeing accelerated now and can structurally be something that could actually help the payments industry and you guys more pronounced near-term, is it enough to offset some of the potential challenges of folks that not travel as much?\nAjay Banga: As you can imagine, Michael is kind of devoting his attention to that, that's his future. So here he is. Michael, go ahead.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Ajay. Hey, Darrin. So when we look at what is changing in terms of, let's say, consumer behaviors or business behaviors, it is little early. As you were saying, it's a little earlier to cast a vote on when and how travel is coming back, but we are engaging out there trying to understand commissioning research, all of that. But there is a few things that are pretty obvious, pretty clear and they're coming through in the numbers already, at least on a relative basis. And the first is this push to e-commerce and digital. So here, people are getting used to, let's say, virtual entertainment, e-sports, people are getting used to consuming via delivery service while they might have gone outside before, so there is some behavior patterns moving towards digital and we believe that will continue to persist. So anything that we do that's related to our digital capabilities, be it in the cyber space, be it in our underlying digital solutions, we should benefit from that. We look at that as a continuous tailwind. Even for the displacement of cash, it's not only displacing existing electronic payments, there's a net increase that we explained - that we expect versus cash. Now, talking about cash, one other thing that I expect coming out of this is that the attitude towards cash will be more negative than what it was before. But even in the most hold out countries, I gave you the example on the German cooperative banks earlier, you start to see a shift to online in e-commerce away from cash even where you could use cash. And that is, to your question Darrin, clearly contactless is going to be the way that will help benefit from that trend. The numbers are astounding, the last quarter 30% to 40% increase. That's really quite significant. The first rounds of consumer research tell us that people do want to spend less cash - are spending less cash actually right now. We've just done a study in the United States, where 60% of people said exactly that. So anti-cash, more contactless is going to be something we all will benefit from. Looking a little closer into our ecosystem. The directly our customers. So this - these underlying trends will also change some of the - we believe that our current exposure from our services portfolio into the world of data analytics, it's a more complex world, there is going to be more change. Everything I just talked about might evolve in 10 different ways going forward, understanding that and using our data points and data analytics will matter more, so we'll expect more demand there. And then Cyber & Intelligence, a world of more online, more of - world of more digital economy is only going to drive what we do in that space. The question in a world of more digital on who is actually transacting the question of digital ID is a significant opportunity. We had an early start of that and we perceive that to be something that is going to get a lot of our attention going forward. As you talked about the government role in getting through the crisis, stimuli packages and so forth. What we expect as a result of that is that the interest that we saw from governments over the last couple of years to look at payments as critical national infrastructure is going to only increase because if the economy is more digital, you will see more governments taking an active role, a multi-rail position will give us a seat at the stable and we already have that dialogue going and we'll see that coming strongly out of that. So those are the top lines that I think are obvious, more granular consumer behaviors, we're staying close, we're running a bunch of research right now to get the latest on that.\nAjay Banga: And the only thing I'd add there is that if you - in a time like this, and it's clear that those who are suffering much worse than others, everybody is suffering. Those who are suffering much worse are those who had less to start out. Getting the economy somehow working better for inclusion when we come out of this I think will become an even more important issue with governments and with thinkers around the world. It's not a coincidence that it's the midst of August. We've announced our commitment to go from $500 million to reached to a $1 billion over the next two years. 50 million small businesses in that and 25 million women entrepreneurs is what we're going to try and reach as a company to facilitate their ability to participate in a better way in the economy as it comes out of COVID. There's a reason why this is a really good time to double down on thinking of that time. We've shown we can do it because we've demonstrated the $500 million. We think we can do even more.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Darrin, one last point. One last point that I feel particularly passionate about, and that's the B2B space. So we've been talking about B2B as a significant opportunity for a number of years now. So when you think about the impact on global supply chains and so forth, what we expect is that the drive towards digitization of supply chains and creating more flexibility is going to only increase. So we believe there's going to be some tailwind in accelerating the - our participation in B2B flows as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Good to hear from you. Just wanted to talk a little bit about interchange rates and network fees. I think you had already announced plans that some of the interchange rate updates in the U.S. were going to be delayed until July, if I'm not mistaken. Is that still the plan or should we assume the changes in either interchange or network fees for that matter are perhaps off the table this year just to help merchants from experiencing even more pressure amid the COVID environment?\nSachin Mehra: Just to be clear, interchange rates, the changes were not just about increasing interchange. We were talking about [indiscernible] merchants would have different changes to their interchange, just to be clear. So the reasons that those haven't gone through is because they were linked up with a whole bunch of technology releases and right now the real challenge for any merchant, any bank who is trying to navigate their way through this with most of their people working out of home or from home or with people struggling to meet the new business models as they don't need new technology changes in the midst of this. So what we decided to do was to postpone all that. I have no idea when we'll do it again, not fixed yet, depends a little bit on how the environment goes and that's how we'll manage through it.\nJason Kupferberg: And then Ajay just wanted to get your quick thoughts. What you've got in terms of the shape of the U.S. recovery?\nAjay Banga: But - U.S. recovery. Back to what I was telling Lisa a little bit, I think it all interconnects there. I actually believe that, and this is just a guess, but I believe that the next couple of quarters, you will begin to see the United States as states open up come a little bit out of this stabilization phase into the normalization phase. I do believe that the therapeutic will help enormously. I believe that Americans are actually quite resilient and their ability to sort of want to go back to being who they are, which is essentially social beings who like being with each other will lead to a certain kind of behavior pattern. We need to do it carefully because the probability post summer, if you believe, those who know the signs, probability post summer of this having some kind of a recurrence hopefully at a lower level, we'll be better prepared and we'll have the therapeutics and our hospitals will be in better shape and our reaction plans would be in better shape. I think that would probably be what happens, and so you'll see some such things come and go. And I think then by the time the year end comes around and people have been through that phase, we'll probably see more confidence. And if by then the news of the vaccine front is good, then you will see a better improvement in the early part of next year, going into the middle and latter part of next year. That's the way I think about it. I don't think we are in this in the short-term. I think this is a medium term thing to plan for. I believe that's how you should build your business and manage your liquidity and think about your employees and clients and shareholders at this point. And that's how we are running our company, in those four phases and we're all talking that language, so that our budgeting, our expense thinking, Michael's drive on prioritizing what we do and what we don't do is unbelievable. And I think that's part of what we're trying to focus on and stay focused with this four-phased thinking. It helps us all talk the same way. Otherwise when you're a global company and China is in a different state from the United States, you know what, it's very confusing to understand underlying trends. But now, we're not confused. We call them in one stage and alternative we'll see how we go.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on China and your news that you're sort of - things are progressing there in terms of your ability to get into the domestic market. Putting aside COVID impact, looking to sort of a future state maybe where things are more normalized, are - how crystallized are the kind of partnerships and infrastructure that you need to generate revenue in that market? Have you kind of put pen closer to paper in terms of your - and can you comment on your kind of strategy and even tactics that you're going to need to kind of deploy to begin generating revenue in the market?\nAjay Banga: Well, first of all, we've already got a great business in China and that's generating revenue today even though the --\nRamsey El-Assal: I meant, domestic. I meant - absolutely, yeah. Yeah.\nAjay Banga: Domestic, yeah. Okay. So we - because otherwise in the current business, we're outperforming on new card growth, the new cards per share, we're doing programs with a bunch of people, we've even done something with the Shanghai Metro, which is a little more oriented there where the first transit deal actually in China is with the Metro. It's the world's third largest software system by the way, by passenger traffic volume and that's rebuilt up over the last few days. Now, we're going into third quarter this year, tens of millions of international travelers to Shanghai, which I hope there will be, will be able to pay at the fare gates with QR codes using their Mastercard in a Shanghai Metro app. That's the kind of work we're doing, not just bank issuance, but actually enabling a lot of the activity that enables us to be embedded in the payments ecosystem in China. The domestic one, we are deep in the process of this year post getting the license application in principal approval. Over the course of the year, we will go through all kinds of things including national security evaluation of the technology and the infrastructure of the ground, that work is progressing at pace. We have not hit that - we\u2019re not cutting back on that. That's our medium and long-term future and we are keeping on running with that. There is nothing new, I can tell you on that because that\u2019s like - it will take its time, it will take time to work its way through. It's still a year away and Michael probably add some more to that.\nMichael Miebach: Yes and Ramsey the conversations with our existing partner on cross border obviously extending into domestic partnerships and most importantly, one thing that we\u2019re using this time for why we do the technology development with our partners of NUCC is driving up the acceptance. Currently our team is out there in the market very actively ensuring that our acceptance footprint is as good as it can be once we get approval from the PBOC to go live. So that's really the focus.\nRamsey El-Assal: That's super helpful. I didn't know you could actually be in their selling acceptance side. So that's good to know. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAjay Banga: No, that's what\u2019s been going on. That\u2019s exactly what we're focused on because remember Mastercard acceptance in China used to be principally driven by the cross-border demand for it, which meant it was by the nature of the beast in certain markets, certain kinds of verticals or if you're doing getting it out there into where it should be, so that it can become a real payment system domestically as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: So can you please zoom in further on travel and provide some color on your area of exposure on tourism versus corporate travel and also just still a very curious based on all of the research, et cetera you\u2019re doing, what your customers are saying, what are the different scenarios, we could be looking at here in terms of corporate travel being just very weak long-term with tourism recovering a little bit faster. Thank you.\nAjay Banga: Well, you get two kinds of points here. So here we will get one point of view that says corporate travel will take a long time to bounce back and actually people will begin to travel in a personal basis at least intra-region and in those corridors, I was referring to earlier. And the other point of view is that actually when business will start interacting again. How do you rebuild supply chains, how do you rebuild business connectivity, you will need to have a degree of corporate travel recommence. And prior analytics don't serve well right now because prior analytics never had a shutdown of so long. Even 9/11 was a few days of impact to travel of this type. And then it came back, even the financial recession. So we went through in 2008, 2009 didn't have this kind of a shut down, I mean oil demand in the world in the financial recession went down in the single digits is down 30% right. So we\u2019re talking a very different scenarios. I\u2019m lost to give you an sort of an analytic view from prior times, prior times frankly corporate travel came back very quickly and personal travel came back a little slower. I don't know what will happen this time. Not sure, yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you and nice to hear that you guys are doing well. I guess I have one question and a follow-up clarification, when we think about the scope of cost containment efforts where exactly are you guys, I'm just trying to think about how we should think about the progression of cost saving opportunities if things get worse or things get better and then I'll just ask the second question upfront or second now. In terms of the relationship wins that are affecting rebates. Is there a revenue contribution that comes in this year or is that more spread out over multiple years? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, Sanjay. I will take, actually I will start with the second question first and then we'll get on to the expense. So on your question around the relationships, which we're either renewing and or building new relationships with. Look, you've got to think about it in the context of things which are existing customers. You probably will start to see the revenues, we\u2019re already seeing the revenue of that come through and to the extent that expanded deals, you will see the revenue of that come through on a sooner basis than you would see in the nature of new relationships where you\u2019re flipping portfolios or you're starting a de novo program or something of that sort. So I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. So you see that kind of come through. I don't see the trend on that by the way being any different than what we've done historically when we signed deals in the past, whether the new deals or renewals, that pattern is pretty much what we're expecting on a going forward basis. As it relates to operating expenses. Let me just give you a line of sight as to what's going on from an operating expense standpoint, I know Michael will share a little bit more about the various areas we're focused on. First, specifically as it relates to the numbers, you can see based on my comments earlier that in the second quarter, we\u2019re sharing our thoughts around how we\u2019re looking to take a decline in our operating expenses in the low single digits range and that's a ramp-up from where we were obviously in the first quarter. I would tell you longer-term, the way you should think about expenses is the following. We have flexibility in our expense base, we're going to do the smart thing, we\u2019re going to do the prudent thing, what we don't want to do is jeopardize the long-term growth prospects of this company, we will remain nimble depending on how the economic environment is playing out and will exercise that prudence from an expense standpoint across the various line items as are appropriate, as part of that process.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, and then Sanjay. That was a pretty comprehensive answer, but just one thing I want to say that you called it out earlier, the two guiding factors are not only the long-term growth in the strategic investments, also market readiness and customer demand. So we would not be going out right now with something that the market is not ready with because everybody's busy addressing COVID-19 and what they should do about it. So there is a couple of initiatives like that, that we\u2019re deferring basically and we\u2019re keeping our broader tie to bring them back to market as and when needed and customer demand is the other thing. Right now we see huge demand for investments and improving, further improving what can be done on cyber. So we can continue to double down there, but you can imagine like promotions in the travel space is just not what is a sensible thing to do right now. So that's kind of how we think about it, customer demand, market readiness and then keeping the strong, the long-term stuff in mind and that gave you the categories earlier.\nWarren Kneeshaw: All right. I think we've got to the end of allotted time. So Ajay, any final comments.\nAjay Banga: Thank you all for your questions and I\u2019m going to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. I know we kept you a little longer than usual, but that's not mistaking that COVID-19 has created a tough environment. But you can see that we\u2019re beginning to get to the early signs of stabilization. We believe our diversified business model will allow us to successfully navigate this and capitalize on opportunities as we come to normalization and ultimately back to growth. We\u2019re carefully managing our expenses. So we will continue to invest in the area that differentiate our company and enable us deliver on our grow, diversify, and build strategy. So you should see us doing things like in services, so the data analytics, and Cyber & Intelligence that we think drive real value for our customers to diversify our revenue base, they enable us to win market share, or in digital solutions like our gateway and digital debit products that enables e-commerce. On an account-to-account capabilities, including most importantly our real-time payment rails that help us to address new payment flows and some ideas in areas which we\u2019ve been investing in for a while like open banking and digital identity. I don't have a crystal ball, you could see that I couldn\u2019t answer some of your questions about where this could go, but I do think we will see certain trend will stand out, the world will be more digital and the secular shift to electronic payments will accelerate. There will be a deeper focus on cyber security and data analytics. Cross-border activity will come back but in phases over time. And importantly, governments will increasingly be open to partnering with the private sector in areas where we bring clear value, real-time payments and cyber security and identity services are examples of that very open view of partnership. We\u2019re heavily invested in these, we are focused on these and as Michael said a little while back and Sachin and I did before that, we have no doubt we will be well prepared to capitalize on these opportunities as they come our way. So thank you for your continued support of the company, be safe, be well. Thank you for joining us today. I'm looking forward to actually being able to see people and shake hands and give somebody a hug once in a while once we get past this. Thank you very much.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks everyone.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajay Banga",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody. Our first quarter started off strong and kind of continuing to build off the solid trends and performance that we had in 2019. But as you all know, as the pandemic developed and spread, it impacted our first quarter performance, but the strength in our services-related revenues shows that the strategy we have perused over the last decade to diversify our revenue streams is paying off. Now, this virus has created a truly extraordinary challenge that we need to address together. And like everyone else, we're trying to do our part. Post the execution of our grow, diversify and build strategy, we've built on the solid foundation of our technology, data, brand and our wonderful people. That's put us in the fortunate position of being able to support our clients and partners throughout this difficult period. And you will hear me and Michael and Sachin talk more about this later. At it's core, this is a health crisis and therefore the public health response is the most important policy response in the near-term. It is the critical first step to getting the world's economies back on track. And as we've all been reading, coordinated efforts, such as the sustained implementation of social distancing and the scaling of our healthcare capacity to address increasing needs are having a positive effect. The company over the middle and longer terms will be dependent on the implementation of successful testing processes and the development of effective prophylactics, therapeutics and vaccines. Now, we are contributing through our investment in the Therapeutics Accelerator together with The Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust. In the mean time, fiscal stimulus packages are being introduced across many markets and this will be a critical effort to provide relief during the downturn for individuals, to small businesses and for others who are particularly hard hit. We're also seeing very strong efforts of monetary policy across a number of countries, which would be particularly supportive as the recovery takes hold. Ultimately, the shape and speed of the recovery will be determined by the effectiveness of these policy initiatives. But again in the mean time, we are helping out. We've joined forces with Onward U.S., a coalition of tech partners and foundations that are addressing displaced workers across the United States. Definitely, we are providing necessary resources to support the unique needs of small businesses with a commitment of $250 million in technology, product and insight assets, as well as philanthropic support. Now, let me shift gears for a moment to tell you how we are looking at this on the ground. We have spent some time together as a team on developing a framework that really helps the entire company. Think about the progression through four distinct phases, containment, stabilization, normalization and growth. Containment of the mitigation initiatives like travel restrictions and social distancing and work from home orders are implemented by public authority in an effort to bend the curve and contain the growth in new COVID cases. From our perspective, from a payment volume perspective, this phase is characterized by rapid contraction in spending levels. Portfolios of stabilization where these mitigation initiatives are by and large complete and spending stabilizes around a new lower level due to mobility limitations with a focus on buying necessities and, of course, aided by e-commerce. We believe we are currently in the stabilization phase in most markets. The next phase is normalization, where governments gradually relax mitigation practices and the environment becomes safer for the citizenry, enabled by the broader availability of testing and tracing and improved therapeutics even before the rollout of an effective vaccine. This phase we think will be characterized by a gradual path to recovery in spending to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate spending will begin to rebound during this phase, but not necessarily evenly. We would expect some sectors, particularly where there is pent-up demand, like home improvement, or clothing, or healthcare, or domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize earlier. Other areas like mass entertainment and long-haul travel will probably take longer to recover. It's possible that we will see early signs of normalization in some sectors and geographies throughout the rest of this year. And the final phase is growth, where spending levels gradually trend higher than pre-COVID levels. We believe a widely available vaccine and proven therapeutics will help to bring this change to fruition. So containment, stabilization, normalization and growth is the framework we are using. It's not necessarily linear, as we've seen in Japan and Singapore recently and frankly it's impossible to say how long this fans will last. We think this framework makes sense. We are running this business with this common lexicon across the company. You will hear us talk about progress in these terms as we move forward. Now, bringing all this back to our business. It is clear that our metrics are being impacted, you've seen those, but our business drivers are rooted in more than just PCE trends. The secular shift from cash and check to electronic forms of payment is important and we expected to accelerate coming out of this crisis. We have worked hard to grow a balanced portfolio across credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments with a focus on strengthening share in debit and prepaid, which tend to be more resilient in times like this. We've also diversified our business in terms of our customer base and geographies as demonstrated with our presence around the globe. Now, our services lines, a significant portion of which are not linked to transaction levels, they help us to further diversify our revenue stream and they are very much in demand. All this on a foundation of a strong balance sheet and liquidity, which allows us to execute on our strategy to capture new payment flows and build new capabilities for the long-term, organically, of course, but also importantly inorganically. The near-term will no doubt look different than we expected it to be just three months ago, but we're very well positioned to make the most of these significant opportunities that we see coming our way. So, now, let me turn to what we are doing to address the situation today. Normally, and like every other time, we are focusing on the things that we can control both inside our company, but also externally with our customers, governments and society at large. Let me start with the most important issue, the health and well-being of our employees. Our offices remain open wherever they have been allowed to do so, but the vast majority of our employees are working from home. Many people are dealing with new circumstances and unexpected challenges. We are helping our employees in every which way that we can. We're providing them with additional health benefits, take time off for those in need to care for themselves or their loved ones. We have assured our employees that there will be no COVID-19-related layoffs this year. Our network and systems remain fully operational based on the resilient core infrastructure that we have built and have regularly tested. We are helping our customers mitigate risk as well, we are engaging with them in scenario planning. we're leveraging AI tools, financial institutions and others to help them fortify their business continuity plans as they navigate the downturn to ensure that they can come out strong on the other side. And we're also reaching out beyond our four walls to support governments, much of we've worked over them in the past with an increased focus on their specific needs in light of today's pandemic crisis. We are uniquely positioned to help them provide emergency payments to both people and businesses through our multirail solutions. We are facilitating specific COVID-related social disbursement programs around the world, reaching millions of some of the hardest hit people, including in the United States through the Direct Express prepaid program or account-to-account rails, which enable about 90% of payroll and support, almost all state benefit payments in the U.K. and now also being leveraged to support payments to displaced workers and financial assistance to businesses in that market. And we're involved in work like this in markets as diverse as Israel and Chile. So there's a lot going on, but we're always thinking about what more we can do. So before we move on, let me just say, we will get through this. I have tremendous confidence in the ability of mankind to find innovative solutions in the face of difficult circumstances. And then confidence returns and it will. We expect the fundamental growth trends that have driven the company will return in force. We have a resilient business model that benefit from diversification, that benefits from our ability to optimize existing products and solutions and benefits by the fact that we can introduce new value prop, all of which contribute to our ability to grow over the longer term. So with that, I'm going to turn this call over to Michael, who, as you know, has all the operating teams reporting to him. And I think I'm very fortunate to have him working side-by-side with me, as we've navigated through this unique time together. So, Michael? Great, thanks. The first part, the part of our fiscal stimulus, while it's tough to exactly figure out what impact that's had, remember that only started to go relatively recently. And remember, that's a fair amount of money in the United States, but outside of the United States, which as you recall 65% of our revenue of 60%-plus comes from outside of the U.S. and the trends when Sachin was speaking were that this third week of April and the continuing trend for the first few days of the next week are global and they're across every region. So I don't know if I could give you a clear answer, but I don't think you can assume that only the fiscal stimulus that's pouring through the system. Sure. So, Bryan on rebates and incentives, you're well aware about how rebates and incentives are constructed. Right? So there is a variable component and there is a fixed component. And the variable component, which is there moves back and forth based on levels of volumes which are going through the system. The fixed incentives are fixed, they remain fixed. And - so to the extent you're going to see variability is going to be on that variable component. The fixed piece is going to be there. The reality is in the first quarter, you can see from our volumes, we were still growing volumes in the first quarter and you're going to see the impact of that come through. The other aspect you've got to keep in mind is the impact of what I would call new and renewed deals. We had mentioned to you in our prior earnings call that - and you quote about the various deals, which we've kind of entered into, you're seeing the impact of that come through on the rebates and incentives line as well. So really that's what you should kind of keep in mind as to what we're seeing there. Obviously, the variable component will change depending on where volumes ultimately trend out for the rest of the year. The fixed will be what it is. The second question which you've got is around cross-border. I mean, we've tried to provide you as much transparency as we can as it relates to what we're seeing in terms of volume trends. I think the thing to keep in mind in cross-border is there are three different kinds of categories of cross-border. There is what you will think about in the nature of intra-Europe cross-border, where - which is generally lower yielding. Then there is the inter-regional cross-border. And I would break that up into two buckets. The two buckets are there is a long-haul inter-regional stuff and then there's the short-haul inter-regional stuff. And I'd bring that up only because even as you think about how we move from stabilization to normalization, you should think about the fact that you would expect intra-Europe and short-haul inter-regional to come back sooner than normal. And that's just kind of by definition. So for example, if you're in Europe and you can do ground transport between one country and the other country, that would happen more naturally as border restrictions are relaxed and you don't have - to the various locations. So that's the way you should think about it. From a yield standpoint, intra-Europe low yielding, inter-regional high yielding. So as inter-regional starts to come back, you've got to factor that into the mix in terms of how you're modeling. On the M&A side, Tien-Tsin - and hi. It's - let me put it this way. There are a couple of things, which we were looking at even before the pandemic hit. Those conversations are continuing and developing, and that's a good thing. There are others that will come up, I'm sure as we go along. I don't know that you should view us as jumping in just because valuations may go down. I think what's more interesting here is that the willingness of the other parties to be able to feel that they may be in a better home with a company like ours that gives them access to distribution, capabilities, geography and capital and liquidity what creates for a better conversation. I view the valuation comment as interesting, but if all you do is jump and the valuations are down, is that really the kind of acquirer you want to be or do you want to be an acquirer of the right time for the right reason. And I think you will find us trying to find the right balance there and get the deals done for what value they bring to us. So we are keeping our powder dry to be thoughtful at a time like this. We're trying to stay away from giving you a percentage regarding good try. But that is very good try. Very good. Let me give you a little bit of color what that comprises of. Right? I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff, as you would imagine in that, which relates to everything from subscription services, to gaming, to purchases in clothing, appliances, there's all the stuff which kind of sits in that category. So to your point about whether it's more akin to what you would see in card not present in the domestic environment, it's actually some very similar categories would sit in there. The one point I want to make sure that I kind of bring out is we are starting to see a lot of the smaller merchants who were previously not present in the online environment activate themselves to get ready to participate and are actually participating in the online environment. We're starting to see that come through. We do feed in daily life right now, right these are people who never provided food and grocery delivery online are all getting online in the last 3.5, five weeks in the United States alone. And that's a big change from the - that's true for cross-border as well. As you can imagine, Michael is kind of devoting his attention to that, that's his future. So here he is. Michael, go ahead. And the only thing I'd add there is that if you - in a time like this, and it's clear that those who are suffering much worse than others, everybody is suffering. Those who are suffering much worse are those who had less to start out. Getting the economy somehow working better for inclusion when we come out of this I think will become an even more important issue with governments and with thinkers around the world. It's not a coincidence that it's the midst of August. We've announced our commitment to go from $500 million to reached to a $1 billion over the next two years. 50 million small businesses in that and 25 million women entrepreneurs is what we're going to try and reach as a company to facilitate their ability to participate in a better way in the economy as it comes out of COVID. There's a reason why this is a really good time to double down on thinking of that time. We've shown we can do it because we've demonstrated the $500 million. We think we can do even more. But - U.S. recovery. Back to what I was telling Lisa a little bit, I think it all interconnects there. I actually believe that, and this is just a guess, but I believe that the next couple of quarters, you will begin to see the United States as states open up come a little bit out of this stabilization phase into the normalization phase. I do believe that the therapeutic will help enormously. I believe that Americans are actually quite resilient and their ability to sort of want to go back to being who they are, which is essentially social beings who like being with each other will lead to a certain kind of behavior pattern. We need to do it carefully because the probability post summer, if you believe, those who know the signs, probability post summer of this having some kind of a recurrence hopefully at a lower level, we'll be better prepared and we'll have the therapeutics and our hospitals will be in better shape and our reaction plans would be in better shape. I think that would probably be what happens, and so you'll see some such things come and go. And I think then by the time the year end comes around and people have been through that phase, we'll probably see more confidence. And if by then the news of the vaccine front is good, then you will see a better improvement in the early part of next year, going into the middle and latter part of next year. That's the way I think about it. I don't think we are in this in the short-term. I think this is a medium term thing to plan for. I believe that's how you should build your business and manage your liquidity and think about your employees and clients and shareholders at this point. And that's how we are running our company, in those four phases and we're all talking that language, so that our budgeting, our expense thinking, Michael's drive on prioritizing what we do and what we don't do is unbelievable. And I think that's part of what we're trying to focus on and stay focused with this four-phased thinking. It helps us all talk the same way. Otherwise when you're a global company and China is in a different state from the United States, you know what, it's very confusing to understand underlying trends. But now, we're not confused. We call them in one stage and alternative we'll see how we go. Well, first of all, we've already got a great business in China and that's generating revenue today even though the -- Domestic, yeah. Okay. So we - because otherwise in the current business, we're outperforming on new card growth, the new cards per share, we're doing programs with a bunch of people, we've even done something with the Shanghai Metro, which is a little more oriented there where the first transit deal actually in China is with the Metro. It's the world's third largest software system by the way, by passenger traffic volume and that's rebuilt up over the last few days. Now, we're going into third quarter this year, tens of millions of international travelers to Shanghai, which I hope there will be, will be able to pay at the fare gates with QR codes using their Mastercard in a Shanghai Metro app. That's the kind of work we're doing, not just bank issuance, but actually enabling a lot of the activity that enables us to be embedded in the payments ecosystem in China. The domestic one, we are deep in the process of this year post getting the license application in principal approval. Over the course of the year, we will go through all kinds of things including national security evaluation of the technology and the infrastructure of the ground, that work is progressing at pace. We have not hit that - we're not cutting back on that. That's our medium and long-term future and we are keeping on running with that. There is nothing new, I can tell you on that because that's like - it will take its time, it will take time to work its way through. It's still a year away and Michael probably add some more to that. No, that's what's been going on. That's exactly what we're focused on because remember Mastercard acceptance in China used to be principally driven by the cross-border demand for it, which meant it was by the nature of the beast in certain markets, certain kinds of verticals or if you're doing getting it out there into where it should be, so that it can become a real payment system domestically as well. Well, you get two kinds of points here. So here we will get one point of view that says corporate travel will take a long time to bounce back and actually people will begin to travel in a personal basis at least intra-region and in those corridors, I was referring to earlier. And the other point of view is that actually when business will start interacting again. How do you rebuild supply chains, how do you rebuild business connectivity, you will need to have a degree of corporate travel recommence. And prior analytics don't serve well right now because prior analytics never had a shutdown of so long. Even 9/11 was a few days of impact to travel of this type. And then it came back, even the financial recession. So we went through in 2008, 2009 didn't have this kind of a shut down, I mean oil demand in the world in the financial recession went down in the single digits is down 30% right. So we're talking a very different scenarios. I'm lost to give you an sort of an analytic view from prior times, prior times frankly corporate travel came back very quickly and personal travel came back a little slower. I don't know what will happen this time. Not sure, yet. Thank you all for your questions and I'm going to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. I know we kept you a little longer than usual, but that's not mistaking that COVID-19 has created a tough environment. But you can see that we're beginning to get to the early signs of stabilization. We believe our diversified business model will allow us to successfully navigate this and capitalize on opportunities as we come to normalization and ultimately back to growth. We're carefully managing our expenses. So we will continue to invest in the area that differentiate our company and enable us deliver on our grow, diversify, and build strategy. So you should see us doing things like in services, so the data analytics, and Cyber & Intelligence that we think drive real value for our customers to diversify our revenue base, they enable us to win market share, or in digital solutions like our gateway and digital debit products that enables e-commerce. On an account-to-account capabilities, including most importantly our real-time payment rails that help us to address new payment flows and some ideas in areas which we've been investing in for a while like open banking and digital identity. I don't have a crystal ball, you could see that I couldn't answer some of your questions about where this could go, but I do think we will see certain trend will stand out, the world will be more digital and the secular shift to electronic payments will accelerate. There will be a deeper focus on cyber security and data analytics. Cross-border activity will come back but in phases over time. And importantly, governments will increasingly be open to partnering with the private sector in areas where we bring clear value, real-time payments and cyber security and identity services are examples of that very open view of partnership. We're heavily invested in these, we are focused on these and as Michael said a little while back and Sachin and I did before that, we have no doubt we will be well prepared to capitalize on these opportunities as they come our way. So thank you for your continued support of the company, be safe, be well. Thank you for joining us today. I'm looking forward to actually being able to see people and shake hands and give somebody a hug once in a while once we get past this. Thank you very much."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks Michael. As Ajay and Michael mentioned, this truly is an unprecedented time for us all. Before I get into the numbers, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the resiliency of the team here at Mastercard. We have maintained their focus in supporting our business, our customers and partners and each other during this challenging period. In light of the current circumstances, I will focus most of my comments today on the trends that we have seen recently, but I will start by walking you through our Q1 results. So turning to page three, here are a few highlights on a currency-neutral basis and excluding both special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue grew 5% with acquisitions contributing approximately 1 ppt to this growth. Total operating expenses increased 8%, which includes a 6 ppt increase related to acquisitions. Operating income grew by 2% and net income was up 3%, both of which include a 3 ppt reduction due to acquisitions. EPS grew 6% year-over-year to $1.83, which includes $0.05 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock. Let's turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter, each of which was impacted by the pandemic starting in February and March. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 8% on a local currency basis and was favorably impacted by an additional processing day due to the leap year, has partially offset the declines due to the pandemic. U.S. GDV grew 6%, down approximately 3 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 9% down 5 ppt from last quarter. Cross-border volume growth was approximately 15% through January, driven by double-digit growth in most regions, but began to decline progressively through February and March as travel restrictions were put in place globally. This resulted in overall cross-border volume decreasing by 1% for the quarter on a local currency basis. I will get into more detail on the trends we are seeing in a moment. Turning to page five, switched transaction growth was approximately 20% through February, reflecting the strong recent trend supported in part by the ongoing adoption of contactless. We then saw declines in March, as stay at home practices were implemented, which resulted in growth of 13% globally for the quarter. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's turn to page six for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 5% net revenue increase was primarily driven by transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in our services offerings, partially offset by a decrease in cross-border volume and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 8% in line with the 8% growth in worldwide GDV. Cross-border volume fees decreased 2%, while cross-border volume decreased 1%. The 1 ppt difference is mainly driven by mix. Transaction processing fees grew 16%, while switched transactions grew 13%, the 3 ppt difference is primarily driven by the strength in services, partially offset by mix. Other revenues were up 28%, including a 6 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions, which held up well this quarter. Finally, rebates and incentives increased 26%, reflecting recent deal activity, as anticipated. If you look at rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues, you will see that they increased sequentially to 35% this quarter reflecting recent deal activity and the impact of the amortization of fixed incentives over a smaller gross revenue base. Moving on to page seven, you can see that on a currency-neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses increased 8%. This includes a 6 ppt increase related to acquisitions, partially offset by a 3 ppt benefit related to the differential in hedging gains and losses versus the year ago period. The remaining 5 ppt of growth related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives, such as digital enablement, safety and security, geographic expansion and new payment flows. Now turning to page eight and given the circumstances, I thought it would be worthwhile to update you on where we stand from a capital allocation standpoint. As you may recall, our capital allocation priorities are to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest for the long-term growth of our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and migrate our capital structure towards a more normalized mix of debt and equity over time. And these priorities have not changed. Despite the impact of COVID-19 through the strength of our business model and prudent expense discipline, we have generated strong operating cash flows in Q1. This strong operating cash flow, the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program and the $4 billion of debt that we raised in the first quarter further strengthened our liquidity position. At the end of the first quarter, we had $10.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We believe that maintaining a strong liquidity position is the prudent thing to do, given the current economic environment. It gives us tremendous flexibility to not only meet our obligations, but to also capitalize on new organic and inorganic opportunities that may present themselves in this environment. We have deals in the pipeline that we are examining actively, as you would expect at a time like this. Lastly, as it relates to the share buyback program, we will reevaluate this as macroeconomic visibility improves and will opportunistically execute on the program as we have historically done. Now, turning to page nine, let's discuss what we've seen through March and the first three weeks of April from an operating metrics standpoint. We are providing additional detail here to help you better understand the recent trends. Essentially, what you see is that through March, we were in the containment phase, with cross-border volumes and domestic spending declining as travel restrictions were implemented, followed by social distancing measures being put in place across various jurisdictions. The rates of decline have recently stabilized as these restrictions have taken hold indicating early signs of the stabilization phase. It is important to point out that social distancing measures have been implemented at different times and to different degrees around the globe and even within countries. So, not every location is in the same phase. Part of Asia moved first, followed by much of the developed world in March, and the balance in the last few weeks. So looking at this a little bit more closely, let's start with switched volumes, where you can see the impacts of the social distancing measures on overall spending, starting progressively in March. The impacts have varied by category with spending on essentials, such as groceries, pharmaceuticals and utilities holding up pretty well. Spending on items that are either discretionary or require mobility are down significantly. This includes categories, such as travel, restaurants, clothing, recreation and gas. We have also seen people deploy healthcare services other than those related to COVID-19. Not surprisingly the way in which people have been making purchases has shifted, specifically as Michael mentioned earlier, card not present spend now accounts for over 50% of switched volume in April, up from about 40% in 2019 as e-commerce spend excluding travel has actually grown. We have also seen merchants accelerate their omnichannel distribution efforts, most notably in restaurants and department stores to accommodate the shift. In total, switched volumes at levels are down approximately 25% versus year ago in recent weeks, indicating early signs of the stabilization phase that Ajay alluded to. The third week of April numbers have actually improved across all regions, perhaps in part due to the early impact of fiscal stimulus, but it's still early days. We are seeing the stabilization continue over the last several days as well. Looking forward, as social distancing measures are relaxed, we expect that some of the sectors that have been hardest hit will begin to show signs of normalization. Early signals will include spending on gas as people return to work and spending on deferred needs, such as health and personal care. We expect some sectors, particularly where there is pent-up demand, such as clothing, home improvement and domestic and intra-regional travel to normalize earlier. Other areas will take longer to respond. For instance, long-haul travel spending and mass entertainment. Trends in switched transactions are similar to what we are seeing in switched volumes, as they are impacted by the same factors for the most part. We are seeing an increase in the use of contactless and card present transactions, supported in part by the increased spending limits that we have facilitated around the world. We think this trend will continue. Turning now to page 10, I would like to provide a little bit - little more color on the cross-border trends we have seen recently. In total, if you look at the gray line, cross-border volume appears to be leveling off, down approximately 50% year-over-year, again, indicating the early signs of the stabilization phase. However, to get a better understanding of these numbers, the best way to think about cross-border is to split it between card present and card not present. Each accounted for about a half of our cross-border spend last year. Not surprisingly, if you look at the orange line, card present spend dropped significantly as the travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented and has since bottomed at a minimal level. So there is very little room left to see further deterioration. On the other hand, card not present, which is the yellow line of the chart has been more resilient, down approximately 25% in April. However, you should know that this includes significant declines in online travel related spend. So looking at the green line, if you exclude online travel, you can see card not present spend is actually up approximately 20% in April, demonstrating the resiliency of this aspect of cross-border. So in summary, the normalization of cross-border spend is dependent on the relaxation of travel restrictions and returning to the growth phase is dependent on an improvement in consumer confidence that is in turn related to the availability of effective therapeutics and ultimately vaccines. Turning now to page 11 and our outlook going forward. For net revenues, given current uncertainties, we will not be providing a forward view for either the second quarter or the year at this time. We do intend, however, to provide periodic updates to our operating metrics throughout the quarter to help you understand the trends we are seeing. Consistent with this approach, we are also withdrawing our 2019 to 2021 performance objectives at this time and we'll reconsider these as we have better visibility. I do, however, want to make a few additional comments to help you with your modeling. First, with respect to cross-border, inter-regional travel has been more significantly impacted than intra-regional travel in Europe. As a result, an increased percentage of cross-border volume is made up of intra-Europe transactions, which are lower yielding than inter-regional transactions. Second, while some portion of our services revenue are linked to transaction levels, a significant portion of the revenue we generate from services is not. This helps our service lines diversify our company's revenues, something we expect to continue to benefit from over the longer term. Overall, we have seen strong demand for our data analytics and cyber solutions. In the second quarter, we expect services growth will continue to outperform our core products. You should, however, expect the growth rates to come down sequentially in the second quarter, but remain positive overall. These declines are due to the dependence of some of our Cyber & Intelligence services on switched transactions, which we expect to be lower sequentially and the impact of social distancing measures on our ability to execute projects at customer sites, and will impact both the transaction processing and the other revenue lines. We would expect services-related revenues to accelerate, as switched transactions begin to normalize and mobility restrictions are relaxed. Separately, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to continue to increase sequentially, reflecting deal activity and amortization of fixed incentives over a smaller gross revenue base. Now, turning to operating expenses, as Michael mentioned, we are managing expenses carefully to ensure we can invest strategic - in strategically important initiatives. We have ramped up our efforts in this area and now expect operating expenses on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, to decline at a low single-digit rate in Q2 versus a year ago.  Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind to revenue for the quarter and the year. Foreign exchange will be a tailwind to operating expenses to a similar extent. Acquisitions will contribute about 1 ppt to revenue and 6 to 8 ppt to operating expenses for both the second quarter and the year, assuming the transaction with Nets closes in the third quarter. In the other income and expense line, we will now be at a quarterly expense run rate of approximately $100 million, given our recent debt issuance and prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. With respect to tax, you should assume a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year, assuming the geographic mix of the business does not change significantly. Ultimately, as Ajay said, we will get through this. We are seeing early signs of stabilization and the impacts of fiscal stimulus. We are in a very strong position to navigate through this period of uncertainty and emerge well positioned to address the significant opportunities that lie ahead. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Yeah. And Craig, it's Sachin. I'll just quickly add to that back to what Ajay was just saying. Right? So even beyond the week ending April 21, we've seen the same trends continue for the next few days coming into this week. Actually if you look around the globe and you start to see in various countries, where there is a slight relaxation taking place in terms of social distancing measures which were put in place as well as cross-border restrictions which are put in place, we're starting to see a little bit of that stabilization impact come through, for example, in markets like Italy, Germany, Poland, Australia - Austria. We're seeing this come through. And so the point really being that as people start to get out and are getting back to, I wouldn't call it their normal ways, but getting back to being able to move around, we're starting to see that level of spend come through as well. On your second question around cross-border, here is what I'd tell you. That cross-border, card not present excluding travel, that lift you're seeing, which is taking place in the third week of April, there are a few factors which are contributing to this. And you should kind of - just kind of keep that in mind. One is timing of Easter globally is having an impact, but equally if not more important, what we're starting to see is the omnichannel prevalence coming through at various merchants across the globe. So with the crisis hitting, more and more merchants are coming to realize the importance of going into online channels. And as they're going into online channels, they've enabled themselves and they're starting to see the impact of that come through. Other categories where you're seeing some level of spend come through is in areas like clothing, in general retail, I would tell you, in subscription services, in the marketplace activity you're seeing. So you're seeing that come through in all of those metrics there. That's kind of the color I'd like to share with you as it relates to how we are seeing those cross-border trend - card not present trends kind of play out. One little comment about margin. I know you asked about cross-border margin, but remember our company has various aspects to its margin mix and one of those which is in - was services, if you remember a few years ago when services were a smaller percentage of our revenue, their margin contribution was also lower and the average margin for our company. That is not the case today. Our services business, all the different lines in it together when you kind of dominate them and look at them, they're very profitable for us as they should be because scale allows us to leverage the fixed cost that we put into building those businesses over a larger volume. So I think as a company, we feel relatively good about where we are on margins. We feel good about some of the revenue diversification. Of course, cross-border is down today and it will be to some extent, as Sachin said, until long-haul intra and inter-regional kind of stuff fix up. That's obvious. And so, we're going to keep doing what we can to keep growing our business in the meanwhile. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So on rebates and incentives, the point really is we're running our business as we would run our business. You know one of our imperatives is to grow market share. We're constantly interacting with our customers. We're going to do deals. We're going to do renew deals. We're going to do new deals. That's just part of course. And so what you're going to see come through is that activity and to the best I've done and the nature of visibility and pipeline and things which are going on, which is a pretty active pipeline, to be completely honest with you, we factor all of that in terms of how we share with you our kind of thoughts around where rebates and incentives will play out. Hi, Lisa. Nice to hear you guys' voice too. We kind of get a little lonely after this locked up thing here. So, here's the thing. What you're asking is the crux of - a crystal ball issue that's a little difficult to get into. But let me give you some thoughts that I've picked over time. The first one is, I actually believe that what you will see that seems is happening in China is you will begin with China I think is in more of a normalization phase than, say the United States and Europe that is more in a stabilization phase. Although, even there, if parts of the U.S. begin to open up as we're hearing some governors speak, you may see a change in that over the next two, three, four, five weeks. I just don't yet know how to predict that well. But let's stick to the idea of with China being in more in the normalization phase than the rest of us. There is a long journey for China through that phase. It's not done, they've just begun. But their local travel has begun. Trains have got bookings. Planes locally have got bookings. Restaurants and bars are open in Shanghai and Beijing and Guangdong and places. Wuhan is still challenged. So, that's - we are learning a little bit from China's experience here. And now you got Australia and New Zealand beginning to think of opening up, so I think we'll get some more data from countries that are a little ahead of the curve than the rest of us. Talking about cross-border travel, China is beginning to talk about corridors of cross-border being opened up, which is to your question about does the government feel comfortable about what kind of connections with certain countries they can reopen. So they're talking about reopening traffic obviously to Hong Kong and Taiwan and Singapore. We're also at a point of time they were thinking about Japan, which has since been a little more challenged, but Japan seems to be improving as well. So I think what you'll find is cross-border travel in corridors or within Europe, which will open first before you get situation of longer haul going. There is the issue of planes having been grounded for quite a while, of crews and planes having to be reactivated. That will also take its own time to come through. The airlines are obviously watching this very carefully and they are very keen to get back on stream, but they need to see some bookings. We know that's in domestic in the United States, the TSA actually cleared more people through their security systems over the last day or two than they had for the previous couple of weeks. Now, that's at a very low level compared to the peak that we saw prior to the crisis, but that's all indicators of how this will get back into shape. I don't know. My general view in life is that we will probably end up with a reliable therapeutic somewhere over the summer, whether it's available in large enough quantities across the entire world literally for those who are disadvantaged, I don't yet know. So the work that we have seen with The Gates Foundation work and with a bunch of others seems to point in that direction. I suspect the availability of the therapeutic will be some kind of a inflection point in the curve. The fact is that without a real vaccine, can you actually get people confident about getting on to long-haul planes and can you get countries confident for letting people in from another country at that point of time without testing them and quarantining them in their entry point. I don't know, I don't think so. And so to me, that probably is still sometime next year, unless there's a miracle and we find a vaccine earlier, which I don't have good scientific reason to believe. So we're kind of running the company through this stabilization, normalization and growth phase, and we are preparing ourselves to have our expenses and our view of the medium and long-term very focused through these lenses. And I think that's what you'll see us doing. We're pretty confident on what we are trying to do here. We are confident about our deal flow, we're confident about our competitive advantages to keep growing share and working well in debit and working with fintechs and real-time payments and open banking and what we're doing with services and digital analytics and cyber security. So I have a lot of faith in what we're up to, but I don't know how to tell you when cross-border will come back. Sure. Sure, Lisa. I'll take that question. Look, I mean, I think first you should recognize that's not an insignificant portion of what the cross-border component is. So it's actually a pretty meaningful portion of the card not present component. Hey, Darrin, one last point. One last point that I feel particularly passionate about, and that's the B2B space. So we've been talking about B2B as a significant opportunity for a number of years now. So when you think about the impact on global supply chains and so forth, what we expect is that the drive towards digitization of supply chains and creating more flexibility is going to only increase. So we believe there's going to be some tailwind in accelerating the - our participation in B2B flows as well. Just to be clear, interchange rates, the changes were not just about increasing interchange. We were talking about [indiscernible] merchants would have different changes to their interchange, just to be clear. So the reasons that those haven't gone through is because they were linked up with a whole bunch of technology releases and right now the real challenge for any merchant, any bank who is trying to navigate their way through this with most of their people working out of home or from home or with people struggling to meet the new business models as they don't need new technology changes in the midst of this. So what we decided to do was to postpone all that. I have no idea when we'll do it again, not fixed yet, depends a little bit on how the environment goes and that's how we'll manage through it. Yes, Sanjay. I will take, actually I will start with the second question first and then we'll get on to the expense. So on your question around the relationships, which we're either renewing and or building new relationships with. Look, you've got to think about it in the context of things which are existing customers. You probably will start to see the revenues, we're already seeing the revenue of that come through and to the extent that expanded deals, you will see the revenue of that come through on a sooner basis than you would see in the nature of new relationships where you're flipping portfolios or you're starting a de novo program or something of that sort. So I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. So you see that kind of come through. I don't see the trend on that by the way being any different than what we've done historically when we signed deals in the past, whether the new deals or renewals, that pattern is pretty much what we're expecting on a going forward basis. As it relates to operating expenses. Let me just give you a line of sight as to what's going on from an operating expense standpoint, I know Michael will share a little bit more about the various areas we're focused on. First, specifically as it relates to the numbers, you can see based on my comments earlier that in the second quarter, we're sharing our thoughts around how we're looking to take a decline in our operating expenses in the low single digits range and that's a ramp-up from where we were obviously in the first quarter. I would tell you longer-term, the way you should think about expenses is the following. We have flexibility in our expense base, we're going to do the smart thing, we're going to do the prudent thing, what we don't want to do is jeopardize the long-term growth prospects of this company, we will remain nimble depending on how the economic environment is playing out and will exercise that prudence from an expense standpoint across the various line items as are appropriate, as part of that process. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajay. Likewise. Yes, these are clearly difficult times, which is why we're leaning in, leaning in with our customer to be the best partner we can possibly be, especially now as we work through the containment and stabilization phases together and compare for normalization and ultimately growth. We're staying closely connected and anticipating the needs of banks, merchants, governments, fintechs as well as the end consumers, while executing on our strategic priorities, driving a secular shift to electronic payments, building new revenue streams and capturing new payment flows, diversifying our customer base and geographic reach. All these have been critical parts of our strategy and they will continue to be key enablers driving our success coming out of this crisis. All of this while remaining agile on how we manage expenses to ensure long-term growth. So let me take each of these three in turns to give you an idea on how we are doing this. First off, the secular shift. Now with trillions of dollars of payments still being made by cash and check despite our best efforts, there's clearly an opportunity to drive new transactions to our products, both online and in store. We've seen a dramatic increase in e-commerce in this time of low mobility and we expect some of these behaviors to persist going forward. When we look at our switched volumes in April, card not present accounts for over 50% of volume, which is up from 40% last year. So our drive to offer our customers expanded digital capabilities online and in app is increasingly important and we are doubling down on these efforts. For example, by leveraging our Payments Gateway services, merchants are able to accept digital payments securely and easily.  And our Simplify Commerce platform makes it easy for small and medium-sized businesses to set e-commerce options up within just a few days, which of course matters more now than ever. Underlying these digital transactions, our tokenization capabilities, which enable safe and secure purchases across every digital channel and bring benefits like improved approval rates, again, really matters us today. We have new commitments with FC in the U.S. and large e-commerce retailers such as JD.com from China to tokenize the cards on file. Now in store, contactless is the fastest, easiest and safest and as of late as announced by the WHO the healthiest way to pay and is a key driver in the conversion of cash to electronic payments, especially now with consumers looking for a quick way to get in and out of stores without exchanging cash, touching terminals or anything else. We have seen over 40% growth in contactless transactions worldwide in the first quarter. Our recent consumer insights indicate that habits are being created today. It will last beyond the current situation, more than half of new tappers are saying they will continue to use contactless once this pandemic is over. And we are helping to enable this by increasing contactless limits around the globe. And in our conversations with banks, we see a renewed commitment to accelerate the issuance of new contactless cards. Now, moving on to the growth pillar. We continue to win important credit, debit, prepaid and commercial deals around the globe. Let me give you just a few recent examples, including our expanded partnership with Sberbank in Russia, an expanded global commercial agreement with Brex including new products and services. We also extended our long-term relationship with Banco Inter in Brazil in the consumer and commercial credit space. And Afterpay has agreed to make Mastercard its preferred commercial prepaid and issuer processing partner. In the U.S., downloading will be moving its commercial card business over to us, including T&E and purchasing cards as well as the new virtual card program. And I'm really pleased to announce that we've won credit and debit programs with Live Oak Bank, a significant provider of small business loans in the U.S., again, very important in these times. I'd like to come back to the debit trend that Ajay mentioned. We've increased our consumer debit share globally over time and our lead - and are leaders in a number of markets such as Brazil, India and several markets in Continental Europe. We believe that this along with our global leadership in prepaid will serve us really well in the current environment and of course beyond. Further, we have products like digital debit, which enable issuers to offer their customers credentials that can be used online, even when their current cards don't have these capabilities. We have several examples this quarter. Most notably, the cooperatives banks in Germany are working exclusively with Mastercard to enable more than 20 million customers with access to digital card - debit cards. Let's shift the focus to our diversification strategy. Now, we continue to make good progress in expanding our customer base, particularly with fintechs, where we moved early and we've developed a leadership position. Some examples of recent wins include a new prepaid co-brand program with Credit Sesame in the U.S. and expanded relationship with N26, otherwise known as N sechsundzwanzig around 80 markets around the globe. Now, on to diversifying geographies. As you all know, we have been looking forward to switching domestic transactions in China. We're really pleased to have received the preliminary approval for our license application, which will allow us to set up our JV with our local partners in UCC. We expect this process will play out over the next year. Now, this takes us to the build pillar of our strategy. As you know, we've made a concerted effort to invest through a combination of organic and inorganic means to build new revenue streams. This has not only accelerated our growth, but also diversified our revenue, which is particularly valuable in these times and will continue to be important over the long run. First off, services. Our services lines are holding up well, despite the downturn as a significant portion are not linked to transaction levels. So let me bring this to life for you. For example, our customers are using our differentiated insights and analytics to help them assess, react and plan during the current crisis. Now, we have implemented our unique test and learn capabilities acquired through our APT acquisition a few years ago to address industry-specific needs. Here's an example this could be engagements like working with grocers on inventory levels and promotions in real-time and many more use cases. We're also working to address frauds, which is even more important as more transactions are moving online. The capabilities that we have acquired through companies like NuData, Brighterion, Ethoca and most recently RiskRecon help us bring significant value to the ecosystem and will continue to position us well as behaviors are likely to shift in the post-COVID-19 world. With RiskRecon, we are providing cyber vulnerability assessments for small businesses and healthcare organizations and Ethoca of issuers and merchants prevent fraud before it even occurs. And it helps to reduce costs and the operational burden of charge back resolution. This breadth of our cyber intelligence services allows us to assist even beyond payments, as we are doing by creating a digital identity framework. And finally, here are a couple of updates on our progress in new payment flows and real-time payments, in particular. Our real-time payments implementations are progressing as planned, including in the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and in the Nordics with P27. I do want to point out that our account-to-account rails are particularly resilient in times like these, given the breadth of use cases to address and the recurring nature of these payments. In the U.K. alone, we process more than 2 billion real-time transactions annually, which are growing at double-digits over our account-to-account rails. And as you know, we're involved in account-to-account rails in many more companies - countries around the world. Now, as you would expect, the social distancing measures are pushing more day-to-day activities like person-to-person payments and home delivery services to digital platforms, which in turn use Mastercard Send. We continue to see very strong volume growth here. Even with the slowdown in some aspects of the weak economy like ride-sharing, strong growth persists. We have also seen strong growth across our cross-border assets, including Transfast. There's momentum in both, in P2P flows and in B2C flows of disbursement use cases, including as of late with First Abu Dhabi Bank, which has gone live with cross-border account-to-account remittances. And over to the open banking front, we continue to rollout a set of comprehensive solutions and services that we believe work for all players in the ecosystem. Further to our efforts in Europe that we launched last year, I'm very excited that we will be expanding our longstanding relationship with Tesco to work with them on open banking, which is particularly notable, given the U.K. is a leading market in this space. We see the ability to facilitate the exchange of real-time information, while protecting data privacy as a significant opportunity for us and as the landscape evolves and open banking makes its way around the world. With all of this as a backdrop, we are actively managing our expenses. As the situation developed, we quickly advanced the framework for prioritizing our spending with a focus on how to best support our customers and drive the long-term interests of the company. We looked at each expense line and made adjustments based on factors, such as market readiness and customer demand. At the same time, we have preserved our ability to invest in strategically important areas, such as digital, services, geographic expansion and the enormous opportunities we see in real-time payments. And these are critical to our long-term growth. The flexibility in our model enables us to adapt quickly and adjust as circumstances warrant, we will continue to manage this closely. For more detail on expense management and our financials overall, let me now turn the call over to Sachin. And Tien-Tsin, Michael here. The areas of focus haven't really changed, so we're staying true to the strategy, data analytics, cyber, new payment flows, open banking, those are still top of mind for us as we engage in a manner that Ajay just described. Thanks, Ajay. Hey, Darrin. So when we look at what is changing in terms of, let's say, consumer behaviors or business behaviors, it is little early. As you were saying, it's a little earlier to cast a vote on when and how travel is coming back, but we are engaging out there trying to understand commissioning research, all of that. But there is a few things that are pretty obvious, pretty clear and they're coming through in the numbers already, at least on a relative basis. And the first is this push to e-commerce and digital. So here, people are getting used to, let's say, virtual entertainment, e-sports, people are getting used to consuming via delivery service while they might have gone outside before, so there is some behavior patterns moving towards digital and we believe that will continue to persist. So anything that we do that's related to our digital capabilities, be it in the cyber space, be it in our underlying digital solutions, we should benefit from that. We look at that as a continuous tailwind. Even for the displacement of cash, it's not only displacing existing electronic payments, there's a net increase that we explained - that we expect versus cash. Now, talking about cash, one other thing that I expect coming out of this is that the attitude towards cash will be more negative than what it was before. But even in the most hold out countries, I gave you the example on the German cooperative banks earlier, you start to see a shift to online in e-commerce away from cash even where you could use cash. And that is, to your question Darrin, clearly contactless is going to be the way that will help benefit from that trend. The numbers are astounding, the last quarter 30% to 40% increase. That's really quite significant. The first rounds of consumer research tell us that people do want to spend less cash - are spending less cash actually right now. We've just done a study in the United States, where 60% of people said exactly that. So anti-cash, more contactless is going to be something we all will benefit from. Looking a little closer into our ecosystem. The directly our customers. So this - these underlying trends will also change some of the - we believe that our current exposure from our services portfolio into the world of data analytics, it's a more complex world, there is going to be more change. Everything I just talked about might evolve in 10 different ways going forward, understanding that and using our data points and data analytics will matter more, so we'll expect more demand there. And then Cyber & Intelligence, a world of more online, more of - world of more digital economy is only going to drive what we do in that space. The question in a world of more digital on who is actually transacting the question of digital ID is a significant opportunity. We had an early start of that and we perceive that to be something that is going to get a lot of our attention going forward. As you talked about the government role in getting through the crisis, stimuli packages and so forth. What we expect as a result of that is that the interest that we saw from governments over the last couple of years to look at payments as critical national infrastructure is going to only increase because if the economy is more digital, you will see more governments taking an active role, a multi-rail position will give us a seat at the stable and we already have that dialogue going and we'll see that coming strongly out of that. So those are the top lines that I think are obvious, more granular consumer behaviors, we're staying close, we're running a bunch of research right now to get the latest on that. Yes and Ramsey the conversations with our existing partner on cross border obviously extending into domestic partnerships and most importantly, one thing that we're using this time for why we do the technology development with our partners of NUCC is driving up the acceptance. Currently our team is out there in the market very actively ensuring that our acceptance footprint is as good as it can be once we get approval from the PBOC to go live. So that's really the focus. Yes, and then Sanjay. That was a pretty comprehensive answer, but just one thing I want to say that you called it out earlier, the two guiding factors are not only the long-term growth in the strategic investments, also market readiness and customer demand. So we would not be going out right now with something that the market is not ready with because everybody's busy addressing COVID-19 and what they should do about it. So there is a couple of initiatives like that, that we're deferring basically and we're keeping our broader tie to bring them back to market as and when needed and customer demand is the other thing. Right now we see huge demand for investments and improving, further improving what can be done on cyber. So we can continue to double down there, but you can imagine like promotions in the travel space is just not what is a sensible thing to do right now. So that's kind of how we think about it, customer demand, market readiness and then keeping the strong, the long-term stuff in mind and that gave you the categories earlier. Thank you. Bye-bye."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Jumaria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce the opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.  You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone from New York. And starting off with the key highlight for the quarter. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth as we saw further improvement in our underlying operating metrics. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 28% and EPS up 46% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis. On the same basis, quarter 4 net revenues are 19% above pre-COVID levels in 2019.  So with that, let's take a look at the macroeconomic front. The outlook remains positive despite the recent supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and inflationary pressures. Although there has been a recent surge in COVID cases, there are signs that these may be peaking. By each of these areas' merit monitoring, underlying spending trends remain strong as consumers, businesses and governments have become more adaptable to a changing environment.  In the U.S., economic growth remains solid with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. According to our quarter four SpendingPulse report, which is always based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales, ex-auto, ex-gas were up 6.4% versus a year ago, and up 10.9% versus 2019.  In Europe, GDP growth has been strong, although recently impacted by mobility restrictions. The impact of the Omicron variant reduces, expect the economic growth to pick up in the coming quarters, in large part, thanks to considerable pent up demand from the past year. SpendingPulse shows that overall European retail sales in quarter 4 were up 3.3% versus a year ago and up, 1.3% versus 2019.  In Asia-Pacific vaccination rates continue to improve and we expect the economic recovery to pick up pace as both governments and businesses ramp up investment. The travel recovery in Asia-Pacific has lagged that of the rest of the world and has significant growth potential.  Growth in Latin America is expected to moderate a bit following the rebound in 2021. As it relates to COVID specifically, there are early signs that the Omicron spurt will be relatively short lived. The reality is that the tools we have to deal with the pandemic are more advanced than ever. 60% of the world's population is now at least partially vaccinated. Effective therapeutics are becoming available. And governments are using more targeted measures to limit the spread. More borders have opened and have stayed open despite the recent variant. Although we've always said the path forward will not be linear there are signs we're moving towards the endemic phase of the disease.  Looking at Mastercard spending trends, switched volume growth continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. Both consumer credit and debit continued to grow well. Turning to cross-border, the recovery has continued with overall quarter 4 cross-border levels now higher than those in 2019. Cross-border travel continued to show improvement relative to quarter 3 levels, aided by border openings in the U.S., UK and Canada. While Omicron has had some recent impact on cross-border travel, we continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to 2019 levels by the end of this year.  Cross-border-card-not-present spending ex-travel continue to hold up well in the quarter. So overall, the spending trends are moving in the right direction with some near term travel related headwinds as a result of the variant. Now turning to our business highlights. I outlined in our Investment Committee Meet in November, we remained focused on our grow-diversify-build strategy, and our three strategic priorities which are, expanding in payments; expanding our services; and embracing new networks. Here's an update on how we\u2019re progressing against each of those priorities.  First, we're expanding in payments by growing person to merchant payments, scaling across other payment flows and leaning into innovation in new payment technologies. In aggregate, these targeted flows represent $115 trillion in opportunity. First up, we're driving growth in person to merchant payments through new wins across the globe. In the U.S., I'm excited to announce that we're partnering with Chase and Instacart, leading online grocery platform in North America on a new Instacart Mastercard co-brand program. This partnership marks an additional co-brand win with Chase, quickly following the recent launch of the Chase Aeroplan World Elite Mastercard.  In addition, with First Interstate Bank's planned acquisition of Great Western Bank, we will flip Great Western\u2019s consumer debit, credit and commercial portfolios to Mastercard. And I'm happy to note that the consumer credit portfolio of MERIX Bank, over 3 million customers will transition to Mastercard beginning in the second quarter. MERIX Bank plans to leverage several Mastercard solutions, including our fraud prevention, consulting, open banking and loyalty services. Over in the Netherlands, we've renewed our partnership with Rabobank, which includes the migration of 8 million Maestro cards to Debit Mastercard. We signed an exclusive deal with Westpac in Australia for the new Banking-as-a-Service platform. This platform will allow new players to leverage Westpac's banking capabilities. Afterpay, the first partner on the platform will connect Debit Mastercards to their Money by Afterpay app. And in the UK, the NatWest Debit migration is progressing to plan as in the early stages of consumer rollout. We're also expanding in payments by capturing new payment flows including commercial, B2B accounts payable, bill pay and cross-border remittances. For example, in the consumer space, we've expanded our relationship with Bank of America, where we'll be the lead brand for new commercial card issuance. We've also renewed and expanded our relationship with WEX, including be chosen as their strategic partner and adding open-loop functionality to their millions of closed-loop fleet cards. Turning to accounts payable, we continue to scale Mastercard Track, WEX, BMO, BOK Financial, Melio and Delux will connect to the platform. We also launched the launch -- we also announced the launch of Mastercard Track Instant Pay, which uses machine learning to analyze and initiate automatic virtual card payments, streamlining processes for buyers and improving cash flow for suppliers. And we're driving new B2B acceptance through a global partnership with Boost Payment Solutions with an initial focus on expanding the use of commercial card in seven key markets.  We're addressing new payment flows in consumer bill payments as well. We recently announced the acquisition of Arcus to help deliver bill pay solutions and other real time payment applications in Latin America. Arcus enables digital payments for the majority of households built in Mexico and its connections with banks, fintechs and digital wall providers across the region.  And finally, we continue to capture new flows in cross-border remittances. This quarter, we established a partnership with Travelex in Brazil, who will use Mastercard's cross-border services to send P2P transfers to the U.S. and Europe. For domestic disbursements in the U.S., we partnered with fintech processor TabaPay to make Mastercard Send easily available to fintechs and merchants across multiple use cases. Now shifting gear, we're also expanding in payments by leaning into payment innovation in areas like installments, contactless acceptance and cryptocurrencies. Here are a few examples. Our open-loop Mastercard Installments program that we announced last quarter has been very well received. The U.S. launch is on schedule for quarter one. We're actively bringing new partners into the program as we announced in Middle East, Africa earlier this week, watch this space. Now we're making great progress in expanding contactless acceptance by turning the world's billions of active smartphones into potential acceptance devices, enabling people to buy and sell whenever wherever they want. We now have 100 deployments of Tap on Phone in over 50 markets with leading partners globally.  Contactless penetration increased to one in two of our in-person switch transactions globally this quarter. This is up from approximately one in three prior to the pandemic. And with that, the potential for accelerated acceptance growth, financial inclusion and consumer convenience is substantial. We're also bringing capabilities, experience and reach to help enable the crypto ecosystem. Our new collaboration with Coinbase will allow consumers to use their Mastercard to purchase NFTs, tried that myself.  Our work with ConsenSys will make it easier for software developers to increase the scale, efficiency and speed of transactions on Ethereum and permissioned blockchains. And our CBDC [ph] Sandbox Test Platform, which we launched in 2020 continues to gain traction. We're helping central banks, financial institutions and fintechs simulate the issuance and distribution of CBDC along with the integration of CBDDs with our card network, our real-time payment modules and native blockchain wallets. Now shifting to services, our services support can differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in aiding many of the ones I just mentioned. The group services revenue at 25% in 2021 on a currency neutral basis. We will continue to extend our service capabilities to enhance the value of payments. We even further accelerating our growth by expanding into new areas and new use cases, particularly through our Data & Services and Cyber Intelligence propositions. Again a few examples for you. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Dynamic Yield from McDonald's. Dynamic Yield uses enhanced AI to deliver customized product recommendations, offers and content to consumers. Their customer set includes over 400 global brands ranging from financial services companies like Synchrony to retailers like Lens End. When combined with SessionM's loyalty platform and our Test & Learn experimentation software, we will be able to offer a unified consumer engagement and loyalty hub to our customers. McDonald's is a great example of a company who is using all three of these platforms today with plans to further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield's capabilities globally. In addition, our Ethoca platform continues to experience strong traction in preventing unnecessary chargebacks, a real pinpoint. We added new customers in every region in 2021 for Ethoca. Recently, we launched Ethoca Consumer Clarity, which gives consumers detailed information about purchases on their mobile banking app. Submission is live with issuers across the U.S., UK and several European markets, including OTP Bank, Central Cooperative Bank and Paybox Bank.  Now beyond expanding in payments and expanding in services, our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks. Specifically, we are leveraging our expertise in payments to build out new networks, with current focus on open banking and digital identity.  On the open banking front, we have closed the acquisition of Aiia in November, which brings strong API connectivity to over 2,700 banks across Europe. And combined with Finicity's North American connection, which covered more than 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. market, Mastercard has an unparalleled footprint in the key open banking regions upon which we are building solutions to solve a wide range of use cases. One example is in the mortgage verification space, where Finicity has signed deals with several new partners, including LoanPro [ph].  And in the digital identity space, we're helping our customers with fast, frictionless identity verification services. Ekata has performed strongly over the last quarter, expanding through strategic partnerships with companies such as ZIP and Equifax as well as growing its global footprint with leading fraud [ph] providers Tongdon and AirClick [ph] in Asia-Pacific.  Combined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction. These are large, attractive and growing opportunities, and we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both. So in summary, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter. The macroeconomic outlook remains positive with a few areas that we're monitoring. And we're executing against our three strategic priorities, expanding in payments, expanding our services and embracing new networks, and all that with substantial progress on the product and deal front this quarter. Now Sachin, over to you and the numbers.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.  Net revenue was up 28%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 37%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 44%, which includes no impact from acquisitions as the impact of acquisitions on operating income was offset by a onetime acquisition-related tax benefit.  EPS was up 46% year-over-year to $2.35, which includes a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $528 million through January 24, 2022. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 23% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 23% with debit growth of 15% and credit growth of 34%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 23%, with debit growth of 25% and credit growth of 20%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 125%, up 4 points quarter-over-quarter with credit at 116%, up 5 points sequentially and debit at 134%, up 3 points sequentially. Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 45% and other cross-border volumes up 63%, reflecting continued improvement in travel related cross-border as several borders opened during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, cross-border volume was 109% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at 122% and other cross-border volume at 98% of 2019 levels. Turning to Page 5, switched transactions grew 27% year-over-year in Q4 and were at 132% of 2019 levels. Card-present growth continued to improve while card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In addition, card growth was 9%. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 28% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 24% while worldwide GDV grew 23%. Cross-border volume fees increased 61% while cross-border volumes increased 53%. The APPD difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 28%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 27%.  Other revenues were up 30%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly delivered by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 38%, in line with our expectations, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new internode deal activity. Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 12%, primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing, higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs. Turning now to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of January. First, as a point of process we continue to provide volume and transaction metrics both on a year-over-year and as a percentage of 2019 basis. However, it is important to note that as we turn the calendar and move into 2022 the index versus 2019 metric now looks back three years and therefore includes a compounding improvement relative to the 2021 index metric. This compounding impact must be taken into consideration when considering the sequential trend from Q4 to January. So at the highest level, Omicron has had a minimal impact on overall switched volumes and transactions and has caused some moderation on cross-border travel.  Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switched volumes. Through the first three weeks of January, we are now at 149% of 2019 levels, up 13 points versus Q4. This increase is primarily driven by the compounding effect I just referred to. After adjusting for this compounding effect, switched volumes are tracking similarly to what we saw in Q4. The underlying trends in switched transactions adjusted for the compounding effect are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border volume growth. As I mentioned earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 in Q4 are now above pre-pandemic levels. The Omicron variant, which hit partly through December, impacted the strong cross-border travel momentum we saw in November. That impact has carried over into January. This has been partially offset by an increase in cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. Overall, cross-border volume through the first three weeks of January is now at 116% of 2019 levels, up 7 points versus Q4. In this case, the compounding effect is partially offset by the impact of the Omicron virus on cross-border travel in January. Turning to Page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. While there is some uncertainty related to Omicron and potential future variance, our overall expectations for 2022 are positive. The macroeconomic outlook is for continued growth and domestic spending levels have firmed up well despite the recent surge in cases. The recovery in cross-border travel was progressing well prior to Omicron, and we expect the recovery in cross-border travel to resume as the surge passes. As Michael just noted, the tools available to deal with the pandemic have improved with time. And although the path forward may not be linear, there are signs we are moving towards the endemic phase of this disease.  Many countries have relaxed their border restrictions, and we continue to expect cross-border travel to recover to 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Our recent deal wins, travel oriented portfolios and diversified set of services position us extremely well to capitalize on these trends. Turning to our expectations for the full year 2022, our base case scenario is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro. In terms of operating expenses, we continue to carefully manage our spending as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 4 to 5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year. Turning now to the first quarter, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects some sequential improvement in cross-border travel spending trends within the quarter relative to 2019, as the impact from Omicron starts to recede as the quarter progresses. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 to 3 ppt for the quarter.  From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of high-single digit range versus a year ago on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 6 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year-end which they close and the subsequent year, after which time we do not split them out. For instance, Finicity, which closed in November of 2020 is now folded into the base. We are pleased to have closed the acquisitions of both Aiia and Arcus in November and anticipate closing the pending acquisition of Dynamic Yield in the first half of 2022. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. With that as a backdrop and turning now to Slide 10, I would like to update you on our three year performance objectives for the 2022 to 2024 period that we first introduced in November at our investment community meeting. The bottom line is that there is no change, although our jumping off point for earnings is slightly higher due to our Q4 2021 over performance. As a reminder, these objectives are on a currency neutral basis, exclude special items, gains and losses on equity investments and acquisitions closed after 2021. Using 2021 as our base over the 2022 to 2024 period, we expect to deliver a net revenue compound annual growth rate in the high-teens. This assumes an annual target market volume growth rate of 10% to 11%, cross-border travel returning to 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and doing our services revenues at a 20% plus CAGR.  From an operating margin perspective, we will continue to operate with the philosophy of delivering a minimum annual operating margin of 50%. Having said this, I would like to emphasize that we continue to believe that it is important for us to invest with a long-term growth while delivering positive operating leverage, and we continue to exit -- continue with this philosophy in mind. And finally, we expect to deliver an EPS CAGR in the low-20s range on a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of special items, gains and losses on equity investments and future acquisitions. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw : Thank you, Sachin. Jumaria, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS.\nRayna Kumar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So with cross-border spending now above pre-pandemic levels, are you anticipating any pent-up demand in travel spend in your financial guidance, particularly as we get through the travel months in the summer?\nMichael Miebach : Hi, Rayna. This is Michael. Let me kick this off. So as I said in my remarks earlier, we do see pent-up demand. We've see pent-up demand in the last year and the year before. And it continues. People will want to travel, get out whenever they can, and it has been proven again and again. So there is an assumption there. And we've been pretty vocal about that, that we do continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Sachin?\nSachin Mehra : Yes. I think Michael, you pretty much covered it. The only thing I'd just add is we just need to go back to 2021 where we saw that when people have the ability to travel, they express their intent to travel. And we do believe that the impact of Omicron is going to be short-lived. And as borders start to relax a little bit more and people get a little bit more comfortable around this, people will get out there and express the demand for travel, back to what Michael was just saying.\nMichael Miebach : In fact, I'm heading to Europe tonight so there you go.\nRayna Kumar : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Michael, I want to ask about FedNow. It looks like it will be live in the U.S. in 2023. Domestic RTP system in many countries is used for payments other than consumer to business. But then you have examples like the ones in India with UPI, which is used for retail payments. How do you see that playing out with FedNow? And how can you participate in terms of services enablement for that? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Right, thank you, Harshita. So FedNow, we'll have to see when it actually comes live. But broadly speaking, if we go with our experience in other countries, we believe there is, in real time payments lies the real alternative payment solutions. There's demand by government, there's demand by businesses and consumers. The 20022 Standard allows to carry more data. So there's all sorts of reasons why this might make sense. To your question on how participation looks like, yeah, when we bought Vocalink in 2016, I promise I won't take you back five years now. But that was a conscious decision realizing exactly what I just said. And that we want to play and we have to have those alternatives.  If I look at it from a use case perspective, there are some use cases where cards is just simply an excellent answer today. Its ecosystem drives huge value. And there is -- yes, there might be alternatives, but we continue to invest in that and focus on that. At the same time, there's a whole range of use cases where real time payments account-to-account makes a lot more sense than basic ACH or cash. And that's a displacement opportunity that we certainly want to engage in cross-border remittances, bill pay and the likes. I think where our participation and our differentiation comes in, is we have tools across the whole gamut of the payment solutions. That's our multi-rail strategy. We have advanced this quite significantly over the last couple of years to true multi-rail solutions, not like that we have one and the other in parallel. It's one single solution.  If you look at Mastercard Track, that's exactly what it is. You can pay any which way through -- any which way you like through Mastercard Track, but the payment optimization, the security the pricing, the predictability of the Mastercard good is all the same across all of these options. So I see it as a fundamental opportunity to participate in new flows rather than anything else.\nHarshita Rawat : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller : Thanks, guys. Michael, when we think about the parts of your business that are outperforming partly because of the panic but partly given where we are within the acceleration on spending on electronic payments, can you just walk through that in terms of what kind of sustainability you see to the parts of the business that have sustainable upside now?  In other words, debit volume is now probably bigger than you would have otherwise thought it would be. Services is another piece that's probably higher than it otherwise could have been. Are those sustainable? And then maybe remind us of the parts of the business besides just cross-border that can catch up as we see the recovery again? Thanks, guys. \nMichael Miebach : All right. Thanks, Darrin. So I'll start that off and then maybe Sachin can kick in. So first of all, the secular shift has gotten a real push out of COVID. I mean where we had to spend online. And when I look at that, I think that is a fundamental structural trend, more online commerce, more online banking, more online, everything.  And what has really come out over the last two years that this is a lasting trend. So every bit of consumer research that we do, market research that we do, people will say, I learned to like it. So I'm going to continue to do that. So I think that is an accelerated growth opportunity. And it's a big assumption in our three year long-term guidance that we gave, that we continue to believe that the race towards a more digital economy will be a positive driver for us.  So sustainable growth driver. You see it come through in how we build out acceptance, 19% acceptance growth. We continue to find pockets and opportunities and flows in segments that are just not penetrated with our solutions yet. And so I see the underlying secular growth, I see us show up in more places. I mean I used the term, I think, at the Investor Day, leave no white space. So that is why expanding in payment is pillar one of our strategy.  You pointed to services, now services in a world that is more digital, that throws up more data, in a more digital world, a lot more people need to be safe in that digital world. So our C&I services, our security service solutions. Basically, we can't run fast enough. That has been outperforming. I gave you the growth rate for 2021 and services at 25%, that's for sure, an elevated growth rate and we continue to see that very, very positive. On data and analytics, more data, more people will want to do something with the data. A merchant will understand now that they have more, more merchants are entering into the digital space, how do they find customers in an easy way, how do they retain customers? That's where Dynamic Yield comes in. A perfect tool to really make more of that. And then all of that data in the end will fuel the world of open banking, which is part of our whole new network strategy, the essential and of course, the need for digital identity solutions. So all of that is sustainable.  The catchup opportunity, back to your question, is for sure travel. It is travel, domestic travel has been leading, leisure travel has been leading. Cross-border travel and corporate travel over different curves over time, there's significant catchup opportunity for us. So I think those are the headlines.\nDarrin Peller : Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : Hey. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to ask about net yields. Just looking back, pre-pandemic Mastercard net yields were steadily increasing about 0.5 basis, 1 basis point a year. But then over the last two years, have dropped, first in 2020 then again somewhat over in 2021. Can you just help parse for us a bit, how much of the pressure on yields recently is due to cross-border travel weakness versus perhaps competitive pressure or something like that? And kind of what gives you confidence in one versus the other? And I guess, looking out into 2022, are you now expecting yields to move back the other direction? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra : Sure, Lisa. I'll take that question. So look, I think the short answer to your question is the vast majority of what you've seen in terms of net yields has been driven by the changing mix of the business over the pandemic, primarily cross-border volumes coming down and the impact of that. As you know, cross-border volumes and the revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So you have the impact of that playing through.  I would say fundamentally, we've always operated in a competitive environment. We see no real change in the level of competition relative to what we've seen over the past few years. So candidly, I would tell you our assumption going into our planning cycle, and going into 2022 as well as our three year performance objectives has been one of the impact of having minimal net pricing, which is net of rebates and incentives. And we still continue to believe that to be the case. That was very much the case a couple of years ago as well.  So the point really is a lot of what you're seeing on the net revenue yield is being driven by the changing mix, primarily cross-border. Services continues to do really well, and has been accretive to our yield in the past. And we expect that given the opportunity in services, that will be the case going forward as well.\nLisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I have another follow up question on the cross-border. I guess when we think about Omicron, I know there's been a small impact. But I'm just curious if there's any learnings from it. Do you feel like the resiliency of the consumer, and obviously, the tools that we have, put us in a better position than what where we were maybe when you guys provided your expectations, understanding your expectations haven't changed?  And then I'm just curious, as we've seen the U.S. inbound travel improve, were there any learnings from that? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach : All right, Sanjay. I'll kick that off. So clearly, there have been learnings and there have been learnings across the whole industry. You may have followed some of the airlines during the earnings season. This whole thought about the time period between a surge, a case surge and how bookings are coming back is narrowing. So the first learning is that consumers just become more adaptable. I said that earlier. It's not just consumers, it's actually businesses, consumers and governments.  Now governments have also learned. And governments have learned in terms of how broad-based social distancing measures and quarantine rules and the likes are. And those are much more targeted these days. As I said, more borders stayed open. When the U.S. opened in November, surges were going on in Europe. And there are no entry hurdles at this point. I said I'm traveling to Europe. There's no really -- there's no hurdle at all. It's just pretty easy to get back. So I think the combination of vaccination rates going up, learnings and governments and so far makes it a much more benign mix to deal with whatever might be coming there. So that is a significant assumption that we took as we looked at the rest of the year. You also see that more routes are being opened, more people want to get out whenever they can. So there's a desire and the ability to go out I think, together, make the kind of right package for us that gets us pretty positive.\nSachin Mehra : And Sanjay, I'll just add to what Michael just said. I think you'll remember at our November investment community meeting, we had shared with you that the U.S., UK and Canada inbound cross-border travel corridors represented -- in Q3 of 2019, they represented roughly 20% of total cross-border travel volumes, which we have said. And we said they were tracking at roughly 50% of 2019 levels. This is the data we shared with you at ICM. Well just as an update, as we progressed through the quarter in November, we saw these borders open, which Michael talked about, U.S., UK, Canada. And the same metric, which is the U.S., UK and Canada in Q4 is now at 70% of 2019 levels. So that's just an expression of our confidence about how, when people can travel, they will travel.\nMichael Miebach : And I just want to add one more point. So these are some -- I shared some of the macro learnings. Sachin just talked about the upside potential. Now taking both of that, what we have learned from our customers that are active in the travel space is that everybody is of the same opinion, and hence leaning into the travel sector and winning more co-brands, engaging consumers so that they book with our partners versus somebody else, all that is going on. You see the whole range of wins. The JetBlue renewal was one of the more recent one, the Aeroplan launch with Chase, IAG last year, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of learnings by the travel industry themselves on how to engage and really make these co-brands or co-brand programs worthwhile, which we like a lot.\nSanjay Sakhrani : That's perfect. I have my fingers crossed. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach : Yeah. Very good.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tien-Tsin Wong with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Thank you. Good morning, Michael and Sachin. I wanted to ask about just -- well, it sounds like your macro view hasn't changed too much from what you guys talked about at ICM aside from some of the near term travel headwinds. But I just want to check your 1Q outlook here for high-teens revenue growth when -- it looks like your January trends are growing above that, nicely above that. Any call outs there? Or is that just conservatism?\nSachin Mehra : So look, I mean, Tien-Tsin, here's what I would say. I think in what I shared with you in terms of our Q1 thoughts, you've got to factor in -- there is the headwind, which is coming in from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which I kind of talked about what our estimate around that is. So that would be one kind of call.  But other than that, all we're kind of expressing is where we're seeing our current metrics and how we're assuming the recovery of Omicron to come through over the course of the first quarter, which I kind of shared with you in my prepared remarks. So really nothing else going on there. I will emphasize one more time, what you're seeing in terms of the first three weeks of January, indexed back to 2019 has got a compounding effect. And that, you have to take into consideration when you're checking -- when you're looking at the sequential trends, which is why I was giving that additional color around what the impact of Omicron was, adjusted for the compounding effect on switched volumes, switched transactions and cross-border.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut : Thank you. Good morning. What are your expectations this year for the pace of account-to-account payments rollout in Europe under open banking? And how do you see this affecting credit and debit card growth in Europe? And as a follow up, would appreciate your perspective on Amazon's very public negotiation with Visa over credit card acceptance at Amazon UK. And whether this reflects more payment options for example, account to account? Or is this a one-off negotiation between two corporates?\nMichael Miebach : All right. Let me start, David with that. So account to account in Europe. When you look over the last years in Europe, it's been relatively slow paced in terms of consumer adoption and rollout. We have invested -- we're heavily invested across that with Aiia on the open banking side of account to account, with Nets, with Vocalink. So we're deep in the space. We like -- generally like what we see in terms of direction. Take up, I think it's -- I would call it pace. So that's the first thing I would say.  Initiatives like EPI, you look at that and say their initial focus is actually on the card side. And they're thinking of account-to-account in the longer run that reflects the same that I just said. So continued significant opportunity for cards in Europe, but we see the long-term growth opportunity in account to account. And we've kind of covered our bases there. And with our open banking investments at our initial use cases there, particularly in the UK, I think we can be pretty optimistic about that. Our partnership with Tesco, with Lloyd's, are looking very positive.  So your question around Amazon, that's fundamentally a question for Visa I would say, and for Amazon. We have seen these kind of negotiations in the public domain now and then over the years, relatively short lived and were resolved. These particular news did not involve us at all. We have a strong and longstanding relationship with Amazon. And we agree that consumer choice matters. That's why we have a multi-rail strategy, and we're going to continue to work with Amazon delivering a whole differentiated set of products. So nothing particularly to worry about from our perspective.\nDavid Togut : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just two quick ones for Sachin. Just looking at switched volume on the January month-to-date in the U.S. At 15%, that's down a little bit from where it was running before. I don't know if that's just an anniversarying of some of the comps. I know the three year percentage still increased to 139. But just thinking about on a year-over-year basis, that 15%, anything to call out there?  And then secondly, on rebates and incentives. Any guidance you can give us for fiscal year '22 as a growth rate or as a percentage of revenue? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra : Sure, Bryan. On the first point, you're referring to the 15% year-over-year growth in the first three weeks of January. And you're looking at the sequential trends there. Well, that is a tougher comp ratio. And this goes back to the impact of the economic stimulus, which was enabling better spending back on -- in the comparable period last year, and that's what you're seeing happen there. So that's kind of the answer to the first part of the question.  On your second point, look, I mean, the whole rebates and incentives thing, I need to just emphasize one more time. Look, I know people are focused on the competitive environment. Trust us, we too are, because we operate in that competitive environment. And we want to make sure that we compete effectively with our products, capabilities, services, whatever the case might be. We have not seen a meaningful shift in the competitive environment relative to what we've been used to operating in the past. So that's kind of just to level set where we are.  But specifically to your question, on rebates and incentives, it's dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out through the year. In Q1, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be similar to Q4. That's kind of the extent. And all of this is contemplated in what I've shared with you on our full year thoughts as well as on Q1.\nBryan Keane : Got it. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal : Hi. And thanks for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about supply chain pressure and whether you're seeing any changes. And with that pressure abating and that might be contemplated in your full year guidance? And separately, I just was wondering if you could help us contextualize your exposure to Russia. And what we should expect there if sanctions, in fact, tighten due to political unrest in Ukraine, potential.\nMichael Miebach : All right. Yeah, Ramsey, let me start with the supply chain and touch on Russia quickly. Supply chain pressures are clearly there. You're looking at chip shortages. There's all sorts of things affecting the supply chain. We continue to believe that these are rather short-lived as the supply chain actually bounces out, so that's the first thing I would say. So there's not a huge assumption in our outlook around that. What we've also seen is particularly through the holiday season, pretty significant holiday spending, positive season and people spend what they can spend on. So if they can't buy something, they buy something else. So we've seen shifts in categories. So from that perspective, again, the pent-up demand is an important aspect here.  On Russia, very, very early to tell how this is going to play out. This is certainly\u2014it was one of the points that I referred to earlier, geopolitical uncertainties that we have to keep in focus. We have seen sanctions applied in previous years. And we basically manage through that. We'll have to see what it is. Russia is a substantial and important -- and strategically important market for us. We'll have to see how that plays out.\nRamsey El-Assal : All right. Thanks so much. \nMichael Miebach : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There was a question before on overall yield. I want to ask about domestic assessment specifically. If I look at Q4, I think you're running at about 13.1 basis points. Historically, the number was higher, more closer to 14. Is there anything to call out on that front? Thank you very much.\nSachin Mehra : Hey Dan, look, I mean on domestic assessment, I think what you've seasonally -- I mean, what we've seen is that typically, in Q4, we see the yield of domestic assessments to actually drop off a little bit. That's just what we have historically seen. There's a bunch of moving parts which are going on in that. And really nothing unusual to call out there. The trajectory of what we've seen historically still holds true on a going forward basis.\nDan Dolev : Got it. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And you did discuss the account to account side of things a little bit. But I'm just wondering, given how often this comes up in discussions with investors, we've seen some issues that some of the domestic players have had from a regulatory standpoint. Any thoughts about how that could affect kind of the evolution of that product advantages, perhaps being part of Mastercard might be for Tink and Aiia? And other kind of thoughts about just the growth of that, both in Europe and the U.S.? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach : Right. Moshe, excellent question. We see there is clearly an interest of regulators in new forms of payment. Regulators are always keen on security, on data protection, on consumer protection. That is always in focus. We have most recently seen this with an interest in buy now, pay later. UK regulator is doing a consultation. Various regulators have shown interest to regulate the space. In account-to-account, you should expect something similar. We do know that from a Vocalink and Pay by Account in the UK that is very much in focus. And I think it differentiates an established player like us to basically come in. We have very clear data principles. We have -- we don't sell data to anybody. We believe in the consumer -- strong consumer consent, the likes and the likes. All of that is codified in the Mastercard franchise. So a company that goes beyond just being a fintech and providing a connection and getting money from A to B, but doing it in an organized fashion with very clear roles that people sign up that partner with us, I think is going to be a differentiator.\nSachin Mehra : And I'll just add to what Michael said. I think you're going to remember that when we talked about what we were doing in the open banking space, we were very deliberate about how we went about our activities there, particularly as it relates to how we got data from the banks, and that was all through APIs. It has been our philosophy. And the idea being, you've got to do it in the right way. You cannot do in scraping, you should be doing it through APIs, not only because it's the right thing to do from a safety and security standpoint, but also the data elements you can actually get by virtue of doing it in that manner help you create a much more sustainable long-term product, which you can offer.  So very much part and parcel of what the philosophy has been from the get-go in this space for us.\nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. Thank you, Michael and Sachin. \nSachin Mehra : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDave Koning : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you. And I noticed U.S. average ticket size in Q4, I think it was only up 2%. The prior three quarters up 6% to 7%. So you would think with inflation, it would be accelerating, not decelerating. Is that just consumers returning to card-present maybe lower transaction sizes or just splitting transactions? And what's the impact? That seems positive to you, right?\nSachin Mehra : Yeah, Dave, again, I want to make sure I got the question. But what we've observed -- if you look at our trends for how switched volume and switched transactions are trending, you'll see effectively that the improvement quarter-over-quarter in switched volumes from 131% of 2019 to 136% of 2019 [ph] is a 5-point improvement compared to switched transactions, which have improved from 131% to 132%.  That should signal to you that there is a higher ticket size, which is happening, which you would expect because as people get out and travel more they do so, that's higher ticket in general. They do it on credit products, which are higher ticket size. As also there is -- as e-commerce happens, that happens to be higher. So you've seen that come through in the delta on a sequential basis.\nDave Koning : Yeah. And I was referring more towards -- it looked like it's decelerating in the U.S., which seems positive. It seems good to have splitting transactions possibly happening is what it just seems like or different types somehow?\nSachin Mehra : Yeah. No, I wouldn't see anything materially different in our U.S. trends than what I just shared globally in terms of what we're seeing from a ticket size standpoint.\nDave Koning : All right. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning everybody. One of the more discussed topics in the market generally today is inflation. And I wonder if you could just touch on if we do see persistent embedded global inflation, whether or not that's a positive for your business from a volume and/or yield standpoint?\nMichael Miebach : Right, Andrew. So definitely a significantly discussed topic, all sorts of views on it. So here's our take. First of all, where it happens, we generally distinguish to look at it first at the macro level, what is happening across a particular market? What's the policymakers\u2019 response? We heard the U.S. policymaker talk about this yesterday. Then there's broader impacts that go beyond our immediate business, wage growth. How does all of this, in the end, affect the consumer's ability to spend? So there's a lot of macro things to consider. On the micro side, it basically is not homogenous. So inflation is affecting our business in a different way than it would be the overall CPI. So if you have inflation expecting rent, while that's generally not running through our rails to a large extent, so that could again be a very different picture. Taking all of that into account, fundamentally, notwithstanding the impact that inflation has, that it could be negative on consumers, on businesses and so forth. There is an impact on GDV if it's moderate inflation that would be showing in our numbers.\nAndrew Jeffrey : Okay. I assume that's been taken into account to your guidance.\nSachin Mehra : Right.\nAndrew Jeffrey : Appreciate it. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question will come from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJamie Friedman : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the difference between other revenue and services revenue. I know services did great, up 28% -- 25% for the year, 28% for the quarter. But other actually grew a little bit faster. So Sachin, maybe if you could remind us what the nuance difference is? I know one is a subset of the other.\nSachin Mehra : Yeah. So in other revenue, we have a bunch of our services revenue would sit there, but there's other stuff going on in that as well. So you've got for example, some of our Vocalink revenues sits in there. The Nets acquisition would sit in there. And so if you're looking at the other revenue growth rate of 30%, remember 9 points of that growth came from acquisitions, which is just basically a lapping effect of the fact that we didn't have those acquisitions last year at this time than we do at this point in time. So on services, services continues to grow very nicely. A large part of that sits in other revenues. Some of it is in transaction processing. But the growth you're seeing in other revenue is being -- is a combination of strong services growth plus some of the acquisitions, which you're seeing come through in that growth rate there.\nJamie Friedman : Got it. Thank you for the clarification. \nSachin Mehra : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Just very quickly, Sachin, I'm curious, as you look through the weekly trends year-to-date here through January, are you seeing a lot of variability, meaning are you seeing sort of a bigger pickup as we go through the month? And then somewhat related to that, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the rest of the world.\nSachin Mehra : Sorry, what are we seeing in the rest of the world, did you say?\nGeorge Mihalos : Rest of the world versus U.S. I mean, it looks like if I look at your volumes for credit at least, the worldwide volume is now starting to accelerate a little bit and pick up. So I'm just wondering if you're starting to see that really come into the numbers over the last couple of weeks.\nSachin Mehra : Yeah. Okay. So I got your question. So look, I mean, in terms of weekly trends, they bounce around. I mean there's so much which goes on in the nature of weekly trends. It varies depending on the month in question. I'm not seeing anything which is highly unusual in terms of what we're sharing with you on our first three weeks of January in terms of weekly trends. But there is volatility week-over-week. And you would expect that to be the case. And sometimes, it's a comp issue as well. So you got to remember that you've got to kind of go back to what you're comparing the comp to and to see if there's differences in growth rates, which is emanating from that. When we look at spend levels, that's kind of generally the case. As it relates to rest of the world versus the U.S., look, the U.S. on a growth rate basis has a tougher comp this year in the first three weeks of January, just by virtue of the fact that we had a whole bunch come in from the economic stimulus last year. Conversely in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe, when you really think about what's going on there, there was a lockdown in Europe which took place last year in January. So you have an easier comp on Europe from a growth rate standpoint. So you have to factor those in when you're looking at the growth rates there.\nWarren Kneeshaw : I think we have time for just one final question.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask a question about how we should think about quarterly cadence here of net revenue growth. Obviously, you told us about Q1. It sounds like Omicron and FX and rebates are somewhat of a headwind there. Your year-over-year comp, obviously, is much harder in the second quarter than the first quarter. But arguably, you won't really have Omicron headwind at that point.  So just wanted to try and get things calibrated from a modeling standpoint, at least through the first half of the year directionally as we work towards the full year target.\nSachin Mehra : Yeah, Jason. So I'd say, obviously, we've given you some thoughts around Q1 and for the full year at this point to get you started. We'll talk a little bit more about other quarters as the year progressive. But just stepping back a bit, as we said in our remarks, we expect that cross-border travel recovery will resume as the surge passes. And that will reach the cross-border travel back to the 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Look, we continue to be very active on the deal front. And so that needs to be taken into account. But overall, here's what I would say that the pace of cross-border travel recovery will be a key determinant as to how that cadence plays out. And more to come as we go through the year. I'll share a little bit more about what we think about ensuing quarters. But right now, that's the extent of what I'm going to share with you.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Great, thanks, Sachin. Michael, any final comments?\nMichael Miebach : Yeah. I was hoping the last question would be for me. Anyway so thank you for all your questions. As you see, we\u2019re optimistic with the outlook. We reaffirmed our three year guidance that we gave you in November. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to repeat anything we said. I\u2019d just like to thank you for your support. And as usual, a call out for people that make all this happen. Thank you and speak to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.  Net revenue was up 28%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 37%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 44%, which includes no impact from acquisitions as the impact of acquisitions on operating income was offset by a onetime acquisition-related tax benefit.  EPS was up 46% year-over-year to $2.35, which includes a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $528 million through January 24, 2022. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 23% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 23% with debit growth of 15% and credit growth of 34%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 23%, with debit growth of 25% and credit growth of 20%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 125%, up 4 points quarter-over-quarter with credit at 116%, up 5 points sequentially and debit at 134%, up 3 points sequentially. Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 45% and other cross-border volumes up 63%, reflecting continued improvement in travel related cross-border as several borders opened during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, cross-border volume was 109% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at 122% and other cross-border volume at 98% of 2019 levels. Turning to Page 5, switched transactions grew 27% year-over-year in Q4 and were at 132% of 2019 levels. Card-present growth continued to improve while card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In addition, card growth was 9%. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 28% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 24% while worldwide GDV grew 23%. Cross-border volume fees increased 61% while cross-border volumes increased 53%. The APPD difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 28%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 27%.  Other revenues were up 30%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly delivered by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 38%, in line with our expectations, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new internode deal activity. Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 12%, primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing, higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs. Turning now to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of January. First, as a point of process we continue to provide volume and transaction metrics both on a year-over-year and as a percentage of 2019 basis. However, it is important to note that as we turn the calendar and move into 2022 the index versus 2019 metric now looks back three years and therefore includes a compounding improvement relative to the 2021 index metric. This compounding impact must be taken into consideration when considering the sequential trend from Q4 to January. So at the highest level, Omicron has had a minimal impact on overall switched volumes and transactions and has caused some moderation on cross-border travel.  Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switched volumes. Through the first three weeks of January, we are now at 149% of 2019 levels, up 13 points versus Q4. This increase is primarily driven by the compounding effect I just referred to. After adjusting for this compounding effect, switched volumes are tracking similarly to what we saw in Q4. The underlying trends in switched transactions adjusted for the compounding effect are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border volume growth. As I mentioned earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 in Q4 are now above pre-pandemic levels. The Omicron variant, which hit partly through December, impacted the strong cross-border travel momentum we saw in November. That impact has carried over into January. This has been partially offset by an increase in cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. Overall, cross-border volume through the first three weeks of January is now at 116% of 2019 levels, up 7 points versus Q4. In this case, the compounding effect is partially offset by the impact of the Omicron virus on cross-border travel in January. Turning to Page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. While there is some uncertainty related to Omicron and potential future variance, our overall expectations for 2022 are positive. The macroeconomic outlook is for continued growth and domestic spending levels have firmed up well despite the recent surge in cases. The recovery in cross-border travel was progressing well prior to Omicron, and we expect the recovery in cross-border travel to resume as the surge passes. As Michael just noted, the tools available to deal with the pandemic have improved with time. And although the path forward may not be linear, there are signs we are moving towards the endemic phase of this disease.  Many countries have relaxed their border restrictions, and we continue to expect cross-border travel to recover to 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Our recent deal wins, travel oriented portfolios and diversified set of services position us extremely well to capitalize on these trends. Turning to our expectations for the full year 2022, our base case scenario is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro. In terms of operating expenses, we continue to carefully manage our spending as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 4 to 5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year. Turning now to the first quarter, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects some sequential improvement in cross-border travel spending trends within the quarter relative to 2019, as the impact from Omicron starts to recede as the quarter progresses. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 to 3 ppt for the quarter.  From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of high-single digit range versus a year ago on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 6 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year-end which they close and the subsequent year, after which time we do not split them out. For instance, Finicity, which closed in November of 2020 is now folded into the base. We are pleased to have closed the acquisitions of both Aiia and Arcus in November and anticipate closing the pending acquisition of Dynamic Yield in the first half of 2022. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. With that as a backdrop and turning now to Slide 10, I would like to update you on our three year performance objectives for the 2022 to 2024 period that we first introduced in November at our investment community meeting. The bottom line is that there is no change, although our jumping off point for earnings is slightly higher due to our Q4 2021 over performance. As a reminder, these objectives are on a currency neutral basis, exclude special items, gains and losses on equity investments and acquisitions closed after 2021. Using 2021 as our base over the 2022 to 2024 period, we expect to deliver a net revenue compound annual growth rate in the high-teens. This assumes an annual target market volume growth rate of 10% to 11%, cross-border travel returning to 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and doing our services revenues at a 20% plus CAGR.  From an operating margin perspective, we will continue to operate with the philosophy of delivering a minimum annual operating margin of 50%. Having said this, I would like to emphasize that we continue to believe that it is important for us to invest with a long-term growth while delivering positive operating leverage, and we continue to exit -- continue with this philosophy in mind. And finally, we expect to deliver an EPS CAGR in the low-20s range on a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of special items, gains and losses on equity investments and future acquisitions. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Yes. I think Michael, you pretty much covered it. The only thing I'd just add is we just need to go back to 2021 where we saw that when people have the ability to travel, they express their intent to travel. And we do believe that the impact of Omicron is going to be short-lived. And as borders start to relax a little bit more and people get a little bit more comfortable around this, people will get out there and express the demand for travel, back to what Michael was just saying. Sure, Lisa. I'll take that question. So look, I think the short answer to your question is the vast majority of what you've seen in terms of net yields has been driven by the changing mix of the business over the pandemic, primarily cross-border volumes coming down and the impact of that. As you know, cross-border volumes and the revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So you have the impact of that playing through.  I would say fundamentally, we've always operated in a competitive environment. We see no real change in the level of competition relative to what we've seen over the past few years. So candidly, I would tell you our assumption going into our planning cycle, and going into 2022 as well as our three year performance objectives has been one of the impact of having minimal net pricing, which is net of rebates and incentives. And we still continue to believe that to be the case. That was very much the case a couple of years ago as well.  So the point really is a lot of what you're seeing on the net revenue yield is being driven by the changing mix, primarily cross-border. Services continues to do really well, and has been accretive to our yield in the past. And we expect that given the opportunity in services, that will be the case going forward as well. And Sanjay, I'll just add to what Michael just said. I think you'll remember at our November investment community meeting, we had shared with you that the U.S., UK and Canada inbound cross-border travel corridors represented -- in Q3 of 2019, they represented roughly 20% of total cross-border travel volumes, which we have said. And we said they were tracking at roughly 50% of 2019 levels. This is the data we shared with you at ICM. Well just as an update, as we progressed through the quarter in November, we saw these borders open, which Michael talked about, U.S., UK, Canada. And the same metric, which is the U.S., UK and Canada in Q4 is now at 70% of 2019 levels. So that's just an expression of our confidence about how, when people can travel, they will travel. So look, I mean, Tien-Tsin, here's what I would say. I think in what I shared with you in terms of our Q1 thoughts, you've got to factor in -- there is the headwind, which is coming in from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which I kind of talked about what our estimate around that is. So that would be one kind of call.  But other than that, all we're kind of expressing is where we're seeing our current metrics and how we're assuming the recovery of Omicron to come through over the course of the first quarter, which I kind of shared with you in my prepared remarks. So really nothing else going on there. I will emphasize one more time, what you're seeing in terms of the first three weeks of January, indexed back to 2019 has got a compounding effect. And that, you have to take into consideration when you're checking -- when you're looking at the sequential trends, which is why I was giving that additional color around what the impact of Omicron was, adjusted for the compounding effect on switched volumes, switched transactions and cross-border. Sure, Bryan. On the first point, you're referring to the 15% year-over-year growth in the first three weeks of January. And you're looking at the sequential trends there. Well, that is a tougher comp ratio. And this goes back to the impact of the economic stimulus, which was enabling better spending back on -- in the comparable period last year, and that's what you're seeing happen there. So that's kind of the answer to the first part of the question.  On your second point, look, I mean, the whole rebates and incentives thing, I need to just emphasize one more time. Look, I know people are focused on the competitive environment. Trust us, we too are, because we operate in that competitive environment. And we want to make sure that we compete effectively with our products, capabilities, services, whatever the case might be. We have not seen a meaningful shift in the competitive environment relative to what we've been used to operating in the past. So that's kind of just to level set where we are.  But specifically to your question, on rebates and incentives, it's dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out through the year. In Q1, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be similar to Q4. That's kind of the extent. And all of this is contemplated in what I've shared with you on our full year thoughts as well as on Q1. Hey Dan, look, I mean on domestic assessment, I think what you've seasonally -- I mean, what we've seen is that typically, in Q4, we see the yield of domestic assessments to actually drop off a little bit. That's just what we have historically seen. There's a bunch of moving parts which are going on in that. And really nothing unusual to call out there. The trajectory of what we've seen historically still holds true on a going forward basis. And I'll just add to what Michael said. I think you're going to remember that when we talked about what we were doing in the open banking space, we were very deliberate about how we went about our activities there, particularly as it relates to how we got data from the banks, and that was all through APIs. It has been our philosophy. And the idea being, you've got to do it in the right way. You cannot do in scraping, you should be doing it through APIs, not only because it's the right thing to do from a safety and security standpoint, but also the data elements you can actually get by virtue of doing it in that manner help you create a much more sustainable long-term product, which you can offer.  So very much part and parcel of what the philosophy has been from the get-go in this space for us. Thank you. Yeah, Dave, again, I want to make sure I got the question. But what we've observed -- if you look at our trends for how switched volume and switched transactions are trending, you'll see effectively that the improvement quarter-over-quarter in switched volumes from 131% of 2019 to 136% of 2019 [ph] is a 5-point improvement compared to switched transactions, which have improved from 131% to 132%.  That should signal to you that there is a higher ticket size, which is happening, which you would expect because as people get out and travel more they do so, that's higher ticket in general. They do it on credit products, which are higher ticket size. As also there is -- as e-commerce happens, that happens to be higher. So you've seen that come through in the delta on a sequential basis. Yeah. No, I wouldn't see anything materially different in our U.S. trends than what I just shared globally in terms of what we're seeing from a ticket size standpoint. Right. Yeah. So in other revenue, we have a bunch of our services revenue would sit there, but there's other stuff going on in that as well. So you've got for example, some of our Vocalink revenues sits in there. The Nets acquisition would sit in there. And so if you're looking at the other revenue growth rate of 30%, remember 9 points of that growth came from acquisitions, which is just basically a lapping effect of the fact that we didn't have those acquisitions last year at this time than we do at this point in time. So on services, services continues to grow very nicely. A large part of that sits in other revenues. Some of it is in transaction processing. But the growth you're seeing in other revenue is being -- is a combination of strong services growth plus some of the acquisitions, which you're seeing come through in that growth rate there. Sure. Sorry, what are we seeing in the rest of the world, did you say? Yeah. Okay. So I got your question. So look, I mean, in terms of weekly trends, they bounce around. I mean there's so much which goes on in the nature of weekly trends. It varies depending on the month in question. I'm not seeing anything which is highly unusual in terms of what we're sharing with you on our first three weeks of January in terms of weekly trends. But there is volatility week-over-week. And you would expect that to be the case. And sometimes, it's a comp issue as well. So you got to remember that you've got to kind of go back to what you're comparing the comp to and to see if there's differences in growth rates, which is emanating from that. When we look at spend levels, that's kind of generally the case. As it relates to rest of the world versus the U.S., look, the U.S. on a growth rate basis has a tougher comp this year in the first three weeks of January, just by virtue of the fact that we had a whole bunch come in from the economic stimulus last year. Conversely in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe, when you really think about what's going on there, there was a lockdown in Europe which took place last year in January. So you have an easier comp on Europe from a growth rate standpoint. So you have to factor those in when you're looking at the growth rates there. Yeah, Jason. So I'd say, obviously, we've given you some thoughts around Q1 and for the full year at this point to get you started. We'll talk a little bit more about other quarters as the year progressive. But just stepping back a bit, as we said in our remarks, we expect that cross-border travel recovery will resume as the surge passes. And that will reach the cross-border travel back to the 2019 levels by the end of 2022. Look, we continue to be very active on the deal front. And so that needs to be taken into account. But overall, here's what I would say that the pace of cross-border travel recovery will be a key determinant as to how that cadence plays out. And more to come as we go through the year. I'll share a little bit more about what we think about ensuing quarters. But right now, that's the extent of what I'm going to share with you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone from New York. And starting off with the key highlight for the quarter. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth as we saw further improvement in our underlying operating metrics. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 28% and EPS up 46% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis. On the same basis, quarter 4 net revenues are 19% above pre-COVID levels in 2019.  So with that, let's take a look at the macroeconomic front. The outlook remains positive despite the recent supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and inflationary pressures. Although there has been a recent surge in COVID cases, there are signs that these may be peaking. By each of these areas' merit monitoring, underlying spending trends remain strong as consumers, businesses and governments have become more adaptable to a changing environment.  In the U.S., economic growth remains solid with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. According to our quarter four SpendingPulse report, which is always based on all payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales, ex-auto, ex-gas were up 6.4% versus a year ago, and up 10.9% versus 2019.  In Europe, GDP growth has been strong, although recently impacted by mobility restrictions. The impact of the Omicron variant reduces, expect the economic growth to pick up in the coming quarters, in large part, thanks to considerable pent up demand from the past year. SpendingPulse shows that overall European retail sales in quarter 4 were up 3.3% versus a year ago and up, 1.3% versus 2019.  In Asia-Pacific vaccination rates continue to improve and we expect the economic recovery to pick up pace as both governments and businesses ramp up investment. The travel recovery in Asia-Pacific has lagged that of the rest of the world and has significant growth potential.  Growth in Latin America is expected to moderate a bit following the rebound in 2021. As it relates to COVID specifically, there are early signs that the Omicron spurt will be relatively short lived. The reality is that the tools we have to deal with the pandemic are more advanced than ever. 60% of the world's population is now at least partially vaccinated. Effective therapeutics are becoming available. And governments are using more targeted measures to limit the spread. More borders have opened and have stayed open despite the recent variant. Although we've always said the path forward will not be linear there are signs we're moving towards the endemic phase of the disease.  Looking at Mastercard spending trends, switched volume growth continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. Both consumer credit and debit continued to grow well. Turning to cross-border, the recovery has continued with overall quarter 4 cross-border levels now higher than those in 2019. Cross-border travel continued to show improvement relative to quarter 3 levels, aided by border openings in the U.S., UK and Canada. While Omicron has had some recent impact on cross-border travel, we continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to 2019 levels by the end of this year.  Cross-border-card-not-present spending ex-travel continue to hold up well in the quarter. So overall, the spending trends are moving in the right direction with some near term travel related headwinds as a result of the variant. Now turning to our business highlights. I outlined in our Investment Committee Meet in November, we remained focused on our grow-diversify-build strategy, and our three strategic priorities which are, expanding in payments; expanding our services; and embracing new networks. Here's an update on how we're progressing against each of those priorities.  First, we're expanding in payments by growing person to merchant payments, scaling across other payment flows and leaning into innovation in new payment technologies. In aggregate, these targeted flows represent $115 trillion in opportunity. First up, we're driving growth in person to merchant payments through new wins across the globe. In the U.S., I'm excited to announce that we're partnering with Chase and Instacart, leading online grocery platform in North America on a new Instacart Mastercard co-brand program. This partnership marks an additional co-brand win with Chase, quickly following the recent launch of the Chase Aeroplan World Elite Mastercard.  In addition, with First Interstate Bank's planned acquisition of Great Western Bank, we will flip Great Western's consumer debit, credit and commercial portfolios to Mastercard. And I'm happy to note that the consumer credit portfolio of MERIX Bank, over 3 million customers will transition to Mastercard beginning in the second quarter. MERIX Bank plans to leverage several Mastercard solutions, including our fraud prevention, consulting, open banking and loyalty services. Over in the Netherlands, we've renewed our partnership with Rabobank, which includes the migration of 8 million Maestro cards to Debit Mastercard. We signed an exclusive deal with Westpac in Australia for the new Banking-as-a-Service platform. This platform will allow new players to leverage Westpac's banking capabilities. Afterpay, the first partner on the platform will connect Debit Mastercards to their Money by Afterpay app. And in the UK, the NatWest Debit migration is progressing to plan as in the early stages of consumer rollout. We're also expanding in payments by capturing new payment flows including commercial, B2B accounts payable, bill pay and cross-border remittances. For example, in the consumer space, we've expanded our relationship with Bank of America, where we'll be the lead brand for new commercial card issuance. We've also renewed and expanded our relationship with WEX, including be chosen as their strategic partner and adding open-loop functionality to their millions of closed-loop fleet cards. Turning to accounts payable, we continue to scale Mastercard Track, WEX, BMO, BOK Financial, Melio and Delux will connect to the platform. We also launched the launch -- we also announced the launch of Mastercard Track Instant Pay, which uses machine learning to analyze and initiate automatic virtual card payments, streamlining processes for buyers and improving cash flow for suppliers. And we're driving new B2B acceptance through a global partnership with Boost Payment Solutions with an initial focus on expanding the use of commercial card in seven key markets.  We're addressing new payment flows in consumer bill payments as well. We recently announced the acquisition of Arcus to help deliver bill pay solutions and other real time payment applications in Latin America. Arcus enables digital payments for the majority of households built in Mexico and its connections with banks, fintechs and digital wall providers across the region.  And finally, we continue to capture new flows in cross-border remittances. This quarter, we established a partnership with Travelex in Brazil, who will use Mastercard's cross-border services to send P2P transfers to the U.S. and Europe. For domestic disbursements in the U.S., we partnered with fintech processor TabaPay to make Mastercard Send easily available to fintechs and merchants across multiple use cases. Now shifting gear, we're also expanding in payments by leaning into payment innovation in areas like installments, contactless acceptance and cryptocurrencies. Here are a few examples. Our open-loop Mastercard Installments program that we announced last quarter has been very well received. The U.S. launch is on schedule for quarter one. We're actively bringing new partners into the program as we announced in Middle East, Africa earlier this week, watch this space. Now we're making great progress in expanding contactless acceptance by turning the world's billions of active smartphones into potential acceptance devices, enabling people to buy and sell whenever wherever they want. We now have 100 deployments of Tap on Phone in over 50 markets with leading partners globally.  Contactless penetration increased to one in two of our in-person switch transactions globally this quarter. This is up from approximately one in three prior to the pandemic. And with that, the potential for accelerated acceptance growth, financial inclusion and consumer convenience is substantial. We're also bringing capabilities, experience and reach to help enable the crypto ecosystem. Our new collaboration with Coinbase will allow consumers to use their Mastercard to purchase NFTs, tried that myself.  Our work with ConsenSys will make it easier for software developers to increase the scale, efficiency and speed of transactions on Ethereum and permissioned blockchains. And our CBDC [ph] Sandbox Test Platform, which we launched in 2020 continues to gain traction. We're helping central banks, financial institutions and fintechs simulate the issuance and distribution of CBDC along with the integration of CBDDs with our card network, our real-time payment modules and native blockchain wallets. Now shifting to services, our services support can differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in aiding many of the ones I just mentioned. The group services revenue at 25% in 2021 on a currency neutral basis. We will continue to extend our service capabilities to enhance the value of payments. We even further accelerating our growth by expanding into new areas and new use cases, particularly through our Data & Services and Cyber Intelligence propositions. Again a few examples for you. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Dynamic Yield from McDonald's. Dynamic Yield uses enhanced AI to deliver customized product recommendations, offers and content to consumers. Their customer set includes over 400 global brands ranging from financial services companies like Synchrony to retailers like Lens End. When combined with SessionM's loyalty platform and our Test & Learn experimentation software, we will be able to offer a unified consumer engagement and loyalty hub to our customers. McDonald's is a great example of a company who is using all three of these platforms today with plans to further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield's capabilities globally. In addition, our Ethoca platform continues to experience strong traction in preventing unnecessary chargebacks, a real pinpoint. We added new customers in every region in 2021 for Ethoca. Recently, we launched Ethoca Consumer Clarity, which gives consumers detailed information about purchases on their mobile banking app. Submission is live with issuers across the U.S., UK and several European markets, including OTP Bank, Central Cooperative Bank and Paybox Bank.  Now beyond expanding in payments and expanding in services, our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks. Specifically, we are leveraging our expertise in payments to build out new networks, with current focus on open banking and digital identity.  On the open banking front, we have closed the acquisition of Aiia in November, which brings strong API connectivity to over 2,700 banks across Europe. And combined with Finicity's North American connection, which covered more than 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. market, Mastercard has an unparalleled footprint in the key open banking regions upon which we are building solutions to solve a wide range of use cases. One example is in the mortgage verification space, where Finicity has signed deals with several new partners, including LoanPro [ph].  And in the digital identity space, we're helping our customers with fast, frictionless identity verification services. Ekata has performed strongly over the last quarter, expanding through strategic partnerships with companies such as ZIP and Equifax as well as growing its global footprint with leading fraud [ph] providers Tongdon and AirClick [ph] in Asia-Pacific.  Combined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction. These are large, attractive and growing opportunities, and we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both. So in summary, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter. The macroeconomic outlook remains positive with a few areas that we're monitoring. And we're executing against our three strategic priorities, expanding in payments, expanding our services and embracing new networks, and all that with substantial progress on the product and deal front this quarter. Now Sachin, over to you and the numbers. Hi, Rayna. This is Michael. Let me kick this off. So as I said in my remarks earlier, we do see pent-up demand. We've see pent-up demand in the last year and the year before. And it continues. People will want to travel, get out whenever they can, and it has been proven again and again. So there is an assumption there. And we've been pretty vocal about that, that we do continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Sachin? In fact, I'm heading to Europe tonight so there you go. Right, thank you, Harshita. So FedNow, we'll have to see when it actually comes live. But broadly speaking, if we go with our experience in other countries, we believe there is, in real time payments lies the real alternative payment solutions. There's demand by government, there's demand by businesses and consumers. The 20022 Standard allows to carry more data. So there's all sorts of reasons why this might make sense. To your question on how participation looks like, yeah, when we bought Vocalink in 2016, I promise I won't take you back five years now. But that was a conscious decision realizing exactly what I just said. And that we want to play and we have to have those alternatives.  If I look at it from a use case perspective, there are some use cases where cards is just simply an excellent answer today. Its ecosystem drives huge value. And there is -- yes, there might be alternatives, but we continue to invest in that and focus on that. At the same time, there's a whole range of use cases where real time payments account-to-account makes a lot more sense than basic ACH or cash. And that's a displacement opportunity that we certainly want to engage in cross-border remittances, bill pay and the likes. I think where our participation and our differentiation comes in, is we have tools across the whole gamut of the payment solutions. That's our multi-rail strategy. We have advanced this quite significantly over the last couple of years to true multi-rail solutions, not like that we have one and the other in parallel. It's one single solution.  If you look at Mastercard Track, that's exactly what it is. You can pay any which way through -- any which way you like through Mastercard Track, but the payment optimization, the security the pricing, the predictability of the Mastercard good is all the same across all of these options. So I see it as a fundamental opportunity to participate in new flows rather than anything else. All right. Thanks, Darrin. So I'll start that off and then maybe Sachin can kick in. So first of all, the secular shift has gotten a real push out of COVID. I mean where we had to spend online. And when I look at that, I think that is a fundamental structural trend, more online commerce, more online banking, more online, everything.  And what has really come out over the last two years that this is a lasting trend. So every bit of consumer research that we do, market research that we do, people will say, I learned to like it. So I'm going to continue to do that. So I think that is an accelerated growth opportunity. And it's a big assumption in our three year long-term guidance that we gave, that we continue to believe that the race towards a more digital economy will be a positive driver for us.  So sustainable growth driver. You see it come through in how we build out acceptance, 19% acceptance growth. We continue to find pockets and opportunities and flows in segments that are just not penetrated with our solutions yet. And so I see the underlying secular growth, I see us show up in more places. I mean I used the term, I think, at the Investor Day, leave no white space. So that is why expanding in payment is pillar one of our strategy.  You pointed to services, now services in a world that is more digital, that throws up more data, in a more digital world, a lot more people need to be safe in that digital world. So our C&I services, our security service solutions. Basically, we can't run fast enough. That has been outperforming. I gave you the growth rate for 2021 and services at 25%, that's for sure, an elevated growth rate and we continue to see that very, very positive. On data and analytics, more data, more people will want to do something with the data. A merchant will understand now that they have more, more merchants are entering into the digital space, how do they find customers in an easy way, how do they retain customers? That's where Dynamic Yield comes in. A perfect tool to really make more of that. And then all of that data in the end will fuel the world of open banking, which is part of our whole new network strategy, the essential and of course, the need for digital identity solutions. So all of that is sustainable.  The catchup opportunity, back to your question, is for sure travel. It is travel, domestic travel has been leading, leisure travel has been leading. Cross-border travel and corporate travel over different curves over time, there's significant catchup opportunity for us. So I think those are the headlines. All right, Sanjay. I'll kick that off. So clearly, there have been learnings and there have been learnings across the whole industry. You may have followed some of the airlines during the earnings season. This whole thought about the time period between a surge, a case surge and how bookings are coming back is narrowing. So the first learning is that consumers just become more adaptable. I said that earlier. It's not just consumers, it's actually businesses, consumers and governments.  Now governments have also learned. And governments have learned in terms of how broad-based social distancing measures and quarantine rules and the likes are. And those are much more targeted these days. As I said, more borders stayed open. When the U.S. opened in November, surges were going on in Europe. And there are no entry hurdles at this point. I said I'm traveling to Europe. There's no really -- there's no hurdle at all. It's just pretty easy to get back. So I think the combination of vaccination rates going up, learnings and governments and so far makes it a much more benign mix to deal with whatever might be coming there. So that is a significant assumption that we took as we looked at the rest of the year. You also see that more routes are being opened, more people want to get out whenever they can. So there's a desire and the ability to go out I think, together, make the kind of right package for us that gets us pretty positive. And I just want to add one more point. So these are some -- I shared some of the macro learnings. Sachin just talked about the upside potential. Now taking both of that, what we have learned from our customers that are active in the travel space is that everybody is of the same opinion, and hence leaning into the travel sector and winning more co-brands, engaging consumers so that they book with our partners versus somebody else, all that is going on. You see the whole range of wins. The JetBlue renewal was one of the more recent one, the Aeroplan launch with Chase, IAG last year, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of learnings by the travel industry themselves on how to engage and really make these co-brands or co-brand programs worthwhile, which we like a lot. Yeah. Very good. All right. Let me start, David with that. So account to account in Europe. When you look over the last years in Europe, it's been relatively slow paced in terms of consumer adoption and rollout. We have invested -- we're heavily invested across that with Aiia on the open banking side of account to account, with Nets, with Vocalink. So we're deep in the space. We like -- generally like what we see in terms of direction. Take up, I think it's -- I would call it pace. So that's the first thing I would say.  Initiatives like EPI, you look at that and say their initial focus is actually on the card side. And they're thinking of account-to-account in the longer run that reflects the same that I just said. So continued significant opportunity for cards in Europe, but we see the long-term growth opportunity in account to account. And we've kind of covered our bases there. And with our open banking investments at our initial use cases there, particularly in the UK, I think we can be pretty optimistic about that. Our partnership with Tesco, with Lloyd's, are looking very positive.  So your question around Amazon, that's fundamentally a question for Visa I would say, and for Amazon. We have seen these kind of negotiations in the public domain now and then over the years, relatively short lived and were resolved. These particular news did not involve us at all. We have a strong and longstanding relationship with Amazon. And we agree that consumer choice matters. That's why we have a multi-rail strategy, and we're going to continue to work with Amazon delivering a whole differentiated set of products. So nothing particularly to worry about from our perspective. All right. Yeah, Ramsey, let me start with the supply chain and touch on Russia quickly. Supply chain pressures are clearly there. You're looking at chip shortages. There's all sorts of things affecting the supply chain. We continue to believe that these are rather short-lived as the supply chain actually bounces out, so that's the first thing I would say. So there's not a huge assumption in our outlook around that. What we've also seen is particularly through the holiday season, pretty significant holiday spending, positive season and people spend what they can spend on. So if they can't buy something, they buy something else. So we've seen shifts in categories. So from that perspective, again, the pent-up demand is an important aspect here.  On Russia, very, very early to tell how this is going to play out. This is certainly\u2014it was one of the points that I referred to earlier, geopolitical uncertainties that we have to keep in focus. We have seen sanctions applied in previous years. And we basically manage through that. We'll have to see what it is. Russia is a substantial and important -- and strategically important market for us. We'll have to see how that plays out. Thank you. Right. Moshe, excellent question. We see there is clearly an interest of regulators in new forms of payment. Regulators are always keen on security, on data protection, on consumer protection. That is always in focus. We have most recently seen this with an interest in buy now, pay later. UK regulator is doing a consultation. Various regulators have shown interest to regulate the space. In account-to-account, you should expect something similar. We do know that from a Vocalink and Pay by Account in the UK that is very much in focus. And I think it differentiates an established player like us to basically come in. We have very clear data principles. We have -- we don't sell data to anybody. We believe in the consumer -- strong consumer consent, the likes and the likes. All of that is codified in the Mastercard franchise. So a company that goes beyond just being a fintech and providing a connection and getting money from A to B, but doing it in an organized fashion with very clear roles that people sign up that partner with us, I think is going to be a differentiator. Right, Andrew. So definitely a significantly discussed topic, all sorts of views on it. So here's our take. First of all, where it happens, we generally distinguish to look at it first at the macro level, what is happening across a particular market? What's the policymakers' response? We heard the U.S. policymaker talk about this yesterday. Then there's broader impacts that go beyond our immediate business, wage growth. How does all of this, in the end, affect the consumer's ability to spend? So there's a lot of macro things to consider. On the micro side, it basically is not homogenous. So inflation is affecting our business in a different way than it would be the overall CPI. So if you have inflation expecting rent, while that's generally not running through our rails to a large extent, so that could again be a very different picture. Taking all of that into account, fundamentally, notwithstanding the impact that inflation has, that it could be negative on consumers, on businesses and so forth. There is an impact on GDV if it's moderate inflation that would be showing in our numbers. Yeah. I was hoping the last question would be for me. Anyway so thank you for all your questions. As you see, we're optimistic with the outlook. We reaffirmed our three year guidance that we gave you in November. I don't think there's any need to repeat anything we said. I'd just like to thank you for your support. And as usual, a call out for people that make all this happen. Thank you and speak to you next quarter."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Jumaria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.  Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.  With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. So let me start by giving you the highlights of the quarter. Strong revenue and earnings growth continued. The net revenue up 29% and EPS up 48% versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On this same basis, quarter three net revenues are now 11% above pre-COVID levels in 2019. We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending and overall cross-border volumes are now back at 2019 levels, though there still remains significant rules for growth in cross-border travel. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities with good progress on the product and deal fronts this quarter, and we're excited about our acquisition of CipherTrace in the crypto services area and our planned acquisition of Aiia in open banking. So those are the highlights. Looking at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to improve, even though economies are facing supply chain constraints, rising energy prices, and some other inflationary pressures. According to our quarter three SpendingPulse report, which is based on wall payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales, ex auto, ex gas were up 5% versus a year ago and 12% versus 2019, reflecting the return to in-person shopping in the ongoing e-commerce strength. SpendingPulse also indicated an overall European retail sales in quarter three were up 5% and 6% versus 2019. As it relates to COVID specifically, the outlook continues to get better with case numbers generally improving, new therapeutics in the pipeline, progress in vaccinations, and businesses becoming more agile in the phase of remaining restrictions. We're also seeing a general trend toward the opening of travel corridors, notably inbound into the U.S. and some easing of restrictions in Asia. Now turning to our business. While the pandemic is not fully behind us, we're now in the growth phase in most markets domestically and in many markets in cross-border spending as well. We will, therefore, turn the page, and move beyond the four-phased framework that guided us from the last 19 months and focus on managing the business for the growth opportunities ahead of us. Looking at Mastercard's spending trends, Switched volumes improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw particular strength in consumer and commercial credit. Debit spend remains elevated, although it has moderated in recent weeks in part due to waning stimulus benefits. In terms of how people are spending, card-present volumes continue to improve as people are getting out and shopping more while we're still seeing sustained strength in card-not-present spend.  So regardless of whether people want to shop online or in-person, our solutions support that choice and position us well to participate in both trends. Now let's take a look at cross-border. Overall, cross-border returned to 2019 levels in August, driven by improvements in consumer and commercial travel, as well as the ongoing strength of cross-border card-not-present spending ex travel. Our cross-border travel improved from 48% of 2019 levels in the second quarter to 72% this quarter, with substantial upside potential still remaining as and when borders open. Against this backdrop, we're investing in the growth of our business, including the enhancing ends of our leading technology capabilities, like expanding our network edge to connect directly with our customers through the cloud, providing faster and easier access to our products and services. And, of course, we remain focused on our strategic priorities: number one, rolling out core products while driving the shift to digital; two, differentiating and diversifying with our services; and three, leveraging our multi-rail capabilities to offer choice across payment applications.  Now, let's take them one-by-one and turn to how we're growing our core products and driving the shift through digital: through Mastercard Installments, by winning core deals and by continuing our momentum in the fintech space. First, let me tell you about our recently announced Mastercard Installments, our scalable, open loop, buy-now-pay-later solution. Mastercard Installments is differentiated in that it enables banks, lenders, fintechs, and wallets to seamlessly bring buy-now-pay-later solutions to consumers and merchants at scale and in a secure, tokenized manner. With little to no integration for merchants, our solution avoids the need for lenders to engage merchants one-by-one to roll this out, enables them to deliver more payment options to more consumers faster.  Our solution brings choice at scale, delivered through the Mastercard network. Our consumers will be able to access buy-now-pay-later offers through their bank's mobile banking app at the point of checkout and soon directly through Click to Pay. The embedded power of Finicity will help lenders with credit decisioning and enable consumers to easily choose different repayment options. Mastercard Installments will power our core payments and enable us to provide additional value through services, such as data analytics, loyalty, and fraud tools. We've seen strong interest from players on all sides of the ecosystem and look forward to growing our partnerships in this area. As always, we remain focused on continuing to grow share, and we've won deals across the globe this quarter.  In the UK, we're partnering with Chase as the preferred debit partner of their new digital retail bank. In Canada, we've extended our exclusive co-brand with Costco Canada. And in Brazil, we signed a deal with AutoPass to issue more than 10 million cards to mass transit users in the Sao Paulo area, and along with that, open contactless acceptance across their subway trains and city buses. We're also building our leading position with fintechs and mobile money providers. Here are a few recent examples. PayPal has extended its PayPal Business Debit card into our four markets in Europe. PayPal will also directly leverage Mastercard Send for domestic wallet cash-outs and P2P transactions in the U.S. We're partnering with Vodafone in Egypt across all of their mobile money use cases, including cash-outs, P2P, and bill payments. We expanded our strategic partnerships with Yandex in Russia and we'll be their preferred international partner for all of their fintech initiatives. And Finterra, an innovative market leader that connects U.S. banks and fintechs to get cards and financial products into the market, will leverage our digital-first Finicity, Mastercard Send, and cybersecurity assets. Now, shifting to services. Our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in enabling many of the wins I just mentioned. They, of course, also diversify our business. We had many wins in this area in this quarter. Starting with the cybersecurity space. Ethoca is helping multiple players, including AT&T and Mercado Libre, reduce charge-backs through collaboration, thereby creating purchase transparency.  Banco de Bogot\u00e1 is using our artificial intelligence capabilities to improve consumer experiences, increased profitability, and identifying new opportunities. In Europe, the term is leveraging NuData's behavioral biometrics to help thousands of new banks authenticate online transactions. Data analytics. The tourism agencies in Greece, Hungary, and elsewhere are using services like tourism insights and managed services to gather greater visibility of trends and drive deeper insights to support the tourism campaigns. In the UAE, HSBC is leveraging our test-and-learn capabilities to innovate, experiment and roll out new products for better customer engagement. And we're having success in the loyalty space with our innovative digital solutions, driving wins with players like the global fitness chain, Barry's, and First and Saudi National Bank. Now, let's turn to the progress we've made in offering choice to consumers across payment applications with our multi-real capabilities, including open banking, B2B, and crypto. In open banking, we're happy about our planned acquisition of Aiia. Aiia is a leading European open banking player, whose platform expertise, strong API connectivity, and payment capabilities complement our existing open banking assets. We will combine Aiia's European footprint with Finicity's connectivity in the U.S. and our expansion into other markets like Australia. This will allow us to extend each organization's best-in-class capabilities, such as credit decisioning, credit scoring, account information services, and payment applications across markets. Talking about markets, we continue to make progress with our open banking products in Europe with players like Entercard, one of Scandinavia's leading credit card companies. In the U.S., Finicity is working with UGO to enable account opening verifications, along with future plans to expand into payments.  In B2B, we continued to expand the Track Business Payment Service network with key partners like JPMorgan Chase, as well as merchant acquirers such as Moneris, the largest acquirer and leading processor of B2B transactions in Canada, and Priority Commercial Payments, a leading payments technology Company in commercial payment solutions in the U.S. We're also adding new functionality to Track DBS and are partnering with Demica to launch a supply chain finance capability. This functionality empowers payment agents to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital directly through the Mastercard Track DBS platform. And in the UK, HSBC will be the first to issue a Mastercard Track Card to Account Transfer product, an innovative B2B payment solution that allows businesses to use their commercial card program to make payments with any supplier, even if that supplier does not accept card payments, again, a true multi-rail offering. And finally, in the crypto space, we're making it easier for crypto players to connect to our network. We signed up a number of new crypto wallet providers and exchanges this quarter, including Bit2Me, Mobile Power UK, Kanga by ZEN.com, Coinmotion and CoinJar,. Our crypto program, which is based on three principles of engagement, allows consumers to easily buy crypto assets with their Mastercard, spend their crypto balances wherever Mastercard is accepted, cash out their proceeds with Mastercard Send and earn rewards in the form of crypto or even NFT. We're also seeing a growing services opportunity in this space.  Earlier this month, we acquired CipherTrace, a security and fraud monitoring Company with expertise, technologies, insights into more than 900 cryptocurrencies. Our recently announced agreement with Bakkt will also add to our expanding crypto services portfolio. So let me sum this up one more time. We delivered strong revenue earnings growth this quarter. We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending in most markets. And while overall cross-border volumes are back at 2019 levels, there remains significant room for growth in cross-border travel. We're executing against our strategic priorities with good progress of the product and deal front, as you heard, we're doing all of that while carefully managing our expenses. That's it for me. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 29%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 45%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Further, net income growth was also positively impacted by 6 ppt due to the recognition of higher one-time discrete U.S. tax benefits versus a year ago.  EPS was up 48% year-over-year to $2.37, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $361 million through October 25, 2021. So now, let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in both debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 20%, with debit growth of 9% and credit growth of 36%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 20%, with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 16%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at a 121%, up 2 ppt sequentially, with credit at a 111%, up 4 ppt sequentially, and debit at a 131%, flat quarter-over-quarter. Cross-border volume was up 52% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 47% and other cross-border volumes up 60%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the pandemic last year.  In the third quarter, cross-border volume was at 97% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at a 112% and other cross-border volume at 83% of 2019 levels. Notably, cross-border volumes averaged at or above 100% of 2019 levels in the months of August and September. Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 25% year-over-year in Q3 and were at a 131% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remained strong and card-present growth continued to improve. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In Q3, contactless transactions represented 48% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 45% last quarter. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 29% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth.  Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21%, while worldwide GDV grew 20%. Cross-border volume fees increased 59%, while cross-border volumes increased 52%. The 7 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 26%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 25%. Other revenues were up 35%, including a 10 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 34%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes of transactions and new and renewed deal activity.  Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 16%, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, including \u2013 sorry increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of October. We are seeing continued strength in growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part, due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we are, once again, showing 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, when we're not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes through the first three weeks of October, the recent trends have continued with overall switched volumes at a 134% of 2019 levels, up 3 ppt versus Q3.  The U.S. has held steady with some moderation in growth from earlier levels due to the roll-off of stimulus, and outside the U.S., we're seeing continued improvement. Trends in switched transactions remains steady and are generally tracking the trends we're seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, as I noted earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 were back to pre-pandemic levels, starting in August. That improving trend has continued through the first three weeks of October, and we are now at a 105% of 2019 levels. This improvement is driven by increases in both travel and non-travel cross-border volumes. As it relates to travels, we have seen it picking up in all regions, notably within and to Europe and recently into Canada as well. Turning to Page 9, I wanted to really share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, our deal momentum and service lines continued to position us well for growth and diversify our revenues, and we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives. Domestic spending levels remain healthy, and we are encouraged by the recent resurgence in international travel. We are optimistic about the announced relaxation of border restrictions in places like the U.S. and the UK, given that we have seen travel pickup when borders have opened in the past.  Further, the airlines have recently reported increased travel bookings, including long-haul travel. With this as context, assuming domestic and cross-border spending trends relative to 2019 continue to improve, we would expect Q4 net revenues to grow at a low 20s rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, spending recovered progressively in 2020, so we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 7 ppt in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to the pandemic and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. In terms of operating expenses for the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of low double digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our innovation agenda across payments, services, and promising new adjacencies and continued investment in brand and product marketing. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to now have closed on the CipherTrace transaction, and we expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue and 8 ppt to operating expense growth in Q4. This reflects the integration of several acquisitions in the open banking, digital identity, and real-time payment areas. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about 0.5 ppt headwind to both net revenue and operating expenses in Q4. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $120 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the fourth quarter. Thanks, and I hope you will be able to participate in our Virtual Investment Community Meeting on November 10th. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Sachin. Jumaria, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operators Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Since you launched Mastercard Installments now a few weeks ago, can you give some color on what kind of reaction you're seeing from your fintech and bank partners? And also, are you expecting that some of the specialized BNPL providers may use elements of Mastercard Installments? Why or why not, like what would be the trade-off that they will be making there? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Lisa. Let me take that question first. So buy-now-pay-later, exciting space. We talked about it for years, invested with our own installment proposition, facing off to banks five, six years ago, the partnerships, and now as of late Mastercard Installments, as you said. You saw a strong lineup of initial partners, bank partners initially. I mean, the thought is to remind everybody, again, here is a proposition that we have built into our network. So this is really delivered with no hassle for merchants or for lenders at the point of sale. So the reaction from banks are strong. Here in the U.S., that's where our lineup of U.S. partners - lending partners was.  But I've spent time on the roads over the last three weeks in Europe and similar conversation emerged there. It was just a couple of days after the announcement over Italy and banks were saying, \"Wow, this makes a lot of sense. It's really avoiding a significant headache for us and get into a space that we all believe is important from a consumer perspective.\" On the fintech side, fintech lenders, novel lenders, we lean in with fintechs, some call them disruptors. We feel these are partnerships, we should enable anybody who wants to come on our network, and we're certainly marketing that to ensure that we have the full breadth of what the market has in terms of lending offering. That's going to be good for consumers and merchants. So watch this space, more to come. But I think, it's a very compelling proposition.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nDonald Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Michael, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about disintermediation. And it seems like investors are more focused on it after the Square-Afterpay deal. Can you talk about that and your thoughts on more direct payments out of consumer accounts in the U.S.?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So Don, great question. Choice and payments has been a theme for Mastercard now for, I think, basically always, but specifically with our investments in the account-to-account space over the last six years. So we see the demand for merchants and from consumers. For the consumer, it makes sense because you get all your spend into \u2013 you can see it all on one bank account. That would be one aspect to why consumers might like that. Merchants like it for choice and higher baskets of more sales. So the interest is clearly there. We\u2019ve been on this journey for a while and we don\u2019t necessarily see this as a. I mean, that's certainly something to watch.  But we look at it as an opportunity. We say this could be additional volumes that we've not been involved with. This could be what was historically the consumer finance business. This would be something that was just direct debit business that we've seen in some European countries and so forth. So that's broadly how we look at it. We build a full stack around this that helps to get your money from A to B, but that's just half of the story. Probably not even half of the story because it's the whole experience that really matters. You got to have the security. What happens if you do a push payment and you want your money back? Some of those best practices that we've learned over the last decades in cards is what we're intending to build here. So it's interesting to see blogs out there on how account to account might look like. We have four years now in Pay by Account in the UK. We've got those learnings. We're ahead of the market here very clearly knowing what works, what the economic model should look like, what's the proposition that would really make a difference for merchants, for acquirers who will be all playing in this space. So I don't see a disintermediation risk, I see an opportunity for us to extend our partnerships and gain new flows.\nSachin Mehra: And I'll just add on to what Michael just said. As it relates to your question around specifically on the threat of closed loops, look, we're big believers in the benefits of the open loop system, which we believe is very powerful. I mean, for the reasons Michael just mentioned, we bring consumers at scale. We bring global acceptance. I mean, we have north of 80 million merchant acceptance points, and this is growing rapidly, and the cost of acceptance is very competitive. And when you take that, along with what Michael talked about around the various technologies and the expertise we bring, everything from digital solutions, fraud solutions, merchant support, processing assets, now most recently, Mastercard Installments, that\u2019s a very compelling proposition to go and look in our view, which is why we believe that if people wish to scale, the best way to go on is open loop, which is why we've kind of given investment in the business very heavily to drive down that back.\nDonald Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about cross-border travel. Visa, yesterday, I was talking about cross-border travel, not getting to a 100% on the two-year until summer of calendar year '23. Just wanted to get your thoughts on when do you think we'll get to reach back to 100% on cross-border travel? And then secondly, it looks like you guys are running a little bit faster, a little bit ahead of Visa's number for cross-border travel. I'm just wondering what might be some of the factors that are driving a little stronger demand for you guys so far. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So Bryan, I'll go ahead and take that. First, I know you're asking specifically about cross-border travel, but I just want to kind of put the headline out there, which is for cross-border, as a whole, we have seen very strong growth in Q3 as you've seen. And yes, travel has been a big component of that. Specifically, travel between Q2 and Q3 has gone from what was 48% of 2019 levels to 72% in Q3. And now, in the first three weeks of October, it's tracking more like at 77%. And, look, what this signals to us very clearly is if people can travel, they will travel, and I think that's really, really important to recognize. And then when you overlay that with what's going on in the nature of announcements, around opening of borders, more specifically, the U.S. has recently talked about inbound travel into the U.S. In fact, I think, just a couple of days ago, they laid out the actual details around how people can come into the U.S. I mean, you combine that with the fact that Europe has opened up, the UK is showing good signals of opening up. Even in Asia, we\u2019re starting to see corridors between Singapore and Australia, Singapore and India. These corridors are all starting to open up. These are all encouraging signs for us from a cross-border travel standpoint. And we remain optimistic on that front, especially given that if those borders open up and they come with what would be light burdens from a quarantining standpoint, which is what we're seeing right now. People have said that they will travel and they've demonstrated that through Q3. So net-net, here is what I\u2019ll tell you, I think travel is something which people want to do. They're showing that willingness to do it. Now it's a question of which are the other countries which we will open up in addition to the borders I've just talked about. And you're reflecting \u2013 you\u2019re seeing this to be reflected in the bookings, which airlines are boarding as well. So we remain optimistic on this front. I can't really tell you specifically which day or which month it's going to reach up to a 100% of 2019 levels. But generally, the trend is more moving in the right direction there.\nMichael Miebach: Right. And coming back to being on the road for quite a few weeks, you start to see also the mix changing. While initially, this was leisure travel, you start to see business travel really kicking in. So that gives us another signal that really the pent-up demand is coming across all channels. People want to see their customers, they wanted to see their family first, now they want to see their customers. It's happening.\nSachin Mehra: And just one final point I'll make. You remember over the last few quarters, we've talked about how in anticipation for the return of travel, we have been investing in bolstering our capabilities from a travel standpoint. And we've been doing this actually for many years now, but even through the pandemic, we've been winning deals in travel as also our teams have been very focused on the ground in terms of making sure we're optimizing our travel portfolio the best we can. So we're ready to actually jump on this as soon as we start to see the strength come back, which we are seeing now.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Miebach: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of George Mihalos from Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe dovetailing a little bit onto Bryan's question. I just wanted to focus a little bit on how we should be thinking maybe about rebates and incentives going forward. Sachin, should we be thinking this level is sort of similar - 4Q was similar level to 3Q? And then, again, not asking for guidance for next year, obviously. But as you do have cross-border revenues coming back strongly and actually eclipsing 2019 in aggregate, should that sort of put a cap on rebates and incentives as a percentage of revenue, meaning should it, kind of be flattish, if not maybe even a little bit down from '21? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So George, couple of things I kind of just point out on rebates and incentives. I think you know all of this, but I'll just kind of state it here. A few things. We think that incentives is very dependent on the timing of deals and how volume and mix plays out. And it goes to your point around what the mix is between domestic and cross-border and how you model that and bring that in there. In Q4, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially due to increased deal activity. This is pretty normal for us in Q4, and that's what you should expect also going into Q4 of this year. So at the end of the day, a lot is going to depend upon, like I said, what the mix is going to look like. We have said in the past that cross-border revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So again, depending on mix between domestic and cross-border, that will inform our kind of views around where rebates and incentives will go on a going-forward basis. Of course, new and renewed deals, which we remain very active in the market, are also going to be a contributing factor.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask on the Europe front with the discontinuance of the 400 million Maestro cards, that's been in the press here. What are the implications there from a - I'm trying to think from a P&L perspective, as you look to convert at a time when open banking is really heating up here? Just trying to better understand that. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Hi, Tien-Tsin, let me start on that and then Sachin can comment on the P&L side of things. So we've been on this journey of Maestro to Debit Mastercard conversions around the world. You heard us talk about this for a number of years. In Europe, we've really made substantial progress on that front over the years, and we felt it would be important to put a stake in the ground and give assurance to consumers as well as other ecosystem participants, banks, sales force, banking associations of when we see the end of life for the Maestro product. Why are we doing that? We're doing it because here's 450 million consumers who cannot use a Maestro card online because it doesn't work online.  Debit Mastercard is now in its latest form available in a digital-first form. You don't even need a physical card any longer if that's what you want to do, or if you want it just contactless, it gives you the full breadth of choice. So that is why we're doing this. The timing is right. The reaction was essentially, okay, it has to do in some of the leading European tabloids, we made it onto the front page with that news. It is big news in Europe as you rightly said. But it's just a right thing to do. And what we've seen from a performance perspective, it is a more engaging payment tool in your hands, and people use it across all channels, and that's what we want. So we're very encouraged about that. And then Sachin, you can look at the P&L side of thing.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So Tien-Tsin, this will not take effect until 2023, and Michael talked about approximately 400 million Maestro cards globally. Again, this is Europe-specific. There's been a trend which is currently been underway for some time now, and the reality is it's about not issuing new Maestro cards. Existing Maestro cards will continue to be in operation. We've been on this migration path. It makes imminent sense. It just provides better utility for our products in an increasingly digital world. So the reality is I know of view this as a step in the right direction, and we've been on this journey, we'll continue down this path.\nMichael Miebach: Right. And one last aspect here is this - what we've learned here is over the last couple of years as we are moving the shift from Maestro to Debit Mastercard is how do we use this as an opportunity to not only retain our business that we have on the debit front, but also to expand our business on the debit front, so we don't have any concerns on that front.\nTien Tsin Huang: Understood. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Nice job. Listen, when we look at \u2013 or a couple of quick ones is on in - first on inflation and what the impact to your business model would be. Thinking about it from a perspective of how much is obviously, basis points volume-driven, but also we are using pricing power in your model to change? And then second question would be, when you think of the structural impacts from the pandemic and where you are now and thinking ahead of the Investor Day a minute, I mean, is the long-term or medium-term growth potential similar, different, better, worse than it was last time we entered Investor Day, out of curiosity? Thanks, guys.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So Darrin, I'll take your question on inflation. So look, I mean, there's been obviously a lot of talk recently about high inflation levels, whether it's permanent, whether it's long-term, whether it's just transitionary. The reality is the structure of our business model is quite conducive because of the way we price, right? I mean, we've got basis points. We've got cents per transaction as it relates to how we kind of price. So we kind of view the following, which is to the extent that inflation is moderate, right? We think that \u2013 of that to be a positive tailwind kind of to our business.  Again, gradual and moderate inflation is going to be helpful. And the reason I bring that up is any sort of shock to the economy, i.e., any sort of hyperinflationary event oftentimes comes with drastic measures from an interest rate standpoint and comes with cost pressures, which come along with that. So to the extend it's moderate, it's moderately kind of positive for our business. The other thing I would say is it's important to actually see in the basket of goods and services what are the products and services, which are subject to inflation and what is the amount of electronification of the flows, which have taken place and relevance to our business.  So to the extent there's inflation, general inflation taking place in categories which are unrelated to card payments. I mean, that's kind of a net non-event for us. To the extent it's on things which relate to consumer spending, which have been electronified and goes back to my point around moderate inflation being a mild positive here.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Now, Darrin, on your second question, structural changes are they here to last, what makes a trend? Fascinating question. I don't want to upfront the Investor Day, but since you asked the question, I'll give you a couple of highlights on how we're thinking about that. So, the first thing is it helps to understand the psyche of the changing consumer of the small business, so everybody who's kind of in the payment space as an end user and we now have 19 months of studies looking at this, and the numbers have really not changed. Somewhere around 70% of people and business are saying, more digital banking will be what they will be doing going forward. More online shopping is what they will be doing going forward and more contactless. So the secular trend that was playing in our favor for years has clearly accelerated. I mean, if you just look at this quarter's numbers, we talked about sustained e-commerce strength while in-person shopping is coming back. So behavior is truly sticking. So that is - I think that's the most fundamental point that we're seeing coming through. The race to this digital economy it's on. And what that also means is a lot of players want to come in. So there are structural changes in the sense of that the competitive playing field is opening up. More partners are coming in, which for B2B2C player like us is a great opportunity to facilitate the entry of all of these partners, so that's what we're doing. Then you start to look around and say, \"Well, who else is looking at this, these kind of trends and these kind of developments?\" Most notably governments. Governments are looking at this and they have found that over the last 19 months, that payments is indeed a national critical infrastructure. So that comes with government engagement, which is not always necessarily positive. But what we're seeing is, is a real drive to modernize payment infrastructure, and that is where we are invited to the table because we're a true multi-rail network. And they're saying, \"Hey, you're locally invested, you're a locally relevant partner. Let's talk about how do we make this better in our country.\" So that is certainly a structural change as Tien-Tsin asked earlier about new payment flows coming in, open banking, et cetera., in Europe. So we're playing on all of those trends going forward.  So I think that is what is happening. You could - I could go on for a while longer. B2B, clearly, digitizing supply chains is a drive that is in focus. We're seeing that. Data analytics and cybersecurity, that's the last point I want to make on this. With the race towards a more digital economy, there's going to be more data that is available, more business will seek to use that data and run their business in a better way to find more customers. Our test and learn capabilities, our data analytics capabilities help on that. So again, that's a structural trend that's helpful and the same applies for cyber and security. More digital transactions need to be made safe, more people need to be authenticated as they use these tools, again, that plays into our offering. So structural change is really driven by COVID accelerating the race to digital.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. What are your expectations over the next year for the pace of European adoption of account-to-account payments under open banking, especially given the shift online that you've really underscored during COVID? And, in particular, I'm wondering if you see strong customer authentication, which is really a key to account-to-account payments in Europe, being rolled out broadly enough to really affect, let's say, broader adoption of account-to-account payments throughout Europe.\nMichael Miebach: David, let me start on that, and maybe Sachin wants to chime in. So the journey towards account-to-account in Europe, I think it's still early days. So if you look at how PSD2 has rolled out in Europe starting in September 2019, including the strong customer authentication, has been a long journey. Dates have been moved on multiple occasions to give time to the industry to get this right, and get right means that the transaction isn't so secure that nobody can use it any longer. So the trade-off between consumer experience and security is actually found in a balanced way, and what we're seeing in our engagements in Europe is that balance is starting to be struck. So we will reach a point where such strong customer authentication in cards, as well as in other forms of payments will be actually a reality in Europe. So that's the first thing I want to say. When it comes to open banking specifically, so there has been over the last two years, really a focus on driving connectivity in Europe in terms of getting the open banking ecosystem stood up. That's exactly why we put out in our connectivity product in June 2019. That was the first lead into the region, and we've been quite busy with that. Use cases emerging on the basis of that really started in 2020, the UK being ahead of Continental Europe on that while this was still one Europe and UK is still pushing ahead. You heard us talk about Lloyd's on card repayments, about our partnership with Tesco. So the payment capability part of all open banking is really leading in the UK and here our proposition is very well positioned. So we start to see that. And I see the way it\u2019s coming over to Continental Europe as connectivity is now there. Our acquisition of Aiia is perfectly timed here. We expect to close this by the end of the year to not bring in additional- not only bring in additional connectivity, but also additional payment capabilities because I do see. This is not just a data capability, it's a big data, a kind of a data play, account aggregation, personal finance management, and so forth, but it's also a payment opportunity.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I want to follow-up on your comments on crypto. This year, you've made several announcements, including the recent one with Bakkt and the acquisition of CipherTrace. Can you talk about how you see the overall ecosystem evolving? What ways Mastercard can participate here in the growth of crypto and potentially CBDC when they become live? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, Harshita. So always an exciting topic, and we could not have an earnings call without talking about crypto, so I'm happy you brought it up. Looking at this from a number of perspectives other than that, there's a lot going on in the space. We are pretty clear on how we want to play in this. So the first is we see significant volumes in terms of people actually investing in crypto and selling crypto. So as an asset class, there's a lot going on, and I think, we have a role to play to facilitate consumers wanting to do that, if that's what they choose to do.  So these partnership programs on exchanges, crypto exchanges and wallet partners and so forth, have been quite important for us and that is good from a volume perspective, there is real activity. When it comes to crypto as a payment tool, then we take a somewhat differentiated view on that versus we just step into that. We're saying at this point in time, the most likely chance of this kind of technology to work for payments is issued through a government in a form of Central Bank digital currency. We've said that on a couple of calls before, and we said we will make our network ready to do that as and when our government is ready to put out a Central Bank digital currency, then it will exist alongside the dollar or the euro in Settlement Currency in our network.  So we've done that, but that's easily said. How will the government test that? How will a country figure out between the private sector banks and the governments how to do this? That's where our sandbox comes in, so we can provide a safe space for government and private sector banks to figure out how that would actually work. Questions like the last mile, how do you bring utility in to the hands of your citizens if you put out a Central Bank digital currency acceptance questions and so forth. So facilitating investments as an asset class, we do that and we get ready for CBDC. Should there be a private sector stable coin, we might also do that, but we have very strict principles on when to do this and when not.  Now, let me talk about the CipherTrace for a moment, because this space is already an interesting space in so many ways, questions on data privacy, questions on authentication. We just touched on that in the context of Europe and strong customer authentication. We have to expect the Europeans will say, \"Well, strong customer authentication will, of course, play a role in Crypto transactions as well,\" which is where we always lead with security and trust. I mean, that is really synonymous with the name of Mastercard when it comes to payments that we have to do the same role. So it's a massive services opportunity.  CipherTrace, 900 cryptocurrencys. What does CipherTrace actually do? They drive compliance and AML checks into crypto transactions. We can't run fast enough right now to get into the space because a lot of other people are deep into crypto and these questions are not resolved. So asset class, CBDCs and services opportunity, those are three ways that we feel we want to play and we need to play, and we have the differentiated assets to do so.\nHarshita Rawat: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please proceed with your questions.\nDan Dolev: Hey. Thanks for taking my question.\nSachin Mehra: Hello.\nDan Dolev: So, how does the new offering by Plaid with the acquirers or any of that sort of potential disruption there impacting Mastercard and the networks in general? What is the kind of general strategy around it? We're getting a lot of calls on this topic. Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Dan, so I think I touched a little bit on an earlier question that we had on this topic. So here's a blog post that describes account-to-account. We have account-to-account technology really since the acquisition of Vocalink, and we've learned how that works. We like it because it's an additional choice that has provided to consumer and to merchants. But we also have all the learnings, and the learning go around like, how do you create acceptance into that? How do you make it easy for our merchant? How do you actually convince a consumer that actually likes the card proposition? So all of that, it is about standing up an ecosystem.  So, what we believe is this should be something that is built into our network, into our multi-rail capabilities, and it's actually how we're approaching it. So, we're leaning into this. I don't see it as a disruption. That's been our stated strategy, and we have five years of learning, and I think that puts us ahead of the curve to make this a reality. I think this is an interesting alternative when it comes to consumer payments in store, and we have it. We build it. It's for us to really figure out whether the economics settle, what other capabilities that are currently built into our card franchise can we extend into the world of account-to-account payments, for example, charge-backs, those kind of data protection and so forth.  So that's the direction that we are taking. Not really a disintermediation question, an interesting blog, the good things we've done in reality.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, and Dan, I'll just add to that. Just we've got to remember, right, there's a sizable TAM out there. And a fair amount of that TAM is likely not going to be able to be reached by card products. This is where our multi-rail philosophy and strategy as well as our ability to provide choice across various rails, one of which would be an open banking rail used for payment services. It's very helpful because it helps open up the TAM, which is available to us from what used to be primarily card-focused to much more than card-focused, and we do see that opportunity come through here in open banking as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and good morning. A follow-up on the cross-border business. I mean, obviously, very important business for Mastercard. As you look at that business and as we get to full recovery, do you think that the economics of that business will be similar to what they were prior to the pandemic? I mean, the continued development of blockchain and other technologies or account-to-account, is that going to pressure the economics of that business?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Bob. Why don\u2019t I take that. So, look, I mean, the value prop we used to deliver through cross-border payments on our carded products, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic is exactly the same. So we don\u2019t expect that the economic returns, which they will generate, should be any different, given that the value we delivered previously, if anything, has only gotten better over a period of time with more electronification of flows taking place. To your point around several other account-to-account capabilities, which are there in the cross-border space, the reality is we're participating in them today. But it happened to be going after flows, which are not carded flows. They're not point-of-sales flows. They happen to be more in the nature of business-to-business payments. We do that with our \u2013 if you remember, we acquired a Company called Transfast, in addition to the fact that we have our capabilities from HomeSend. The combined capability of that is our cross-border Send capabilities, which is account-to-account cross-border payments. And we'll participate in those flows, but those are separate and distinct from what goes on at the point of sale with our card products today. So net-net, I kind of view the whole cross-border space as a positive for us as and when travel comes back from a card standpoint. And in the meantime, we continue to actually plant flags in different parts of the world with the reach we\u2019ve established on our B2B flows from a cross-border standpoint.\nBob Napoli: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nMichael Miebach: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. A follow-up on cross-border. I guess, in the third quarter, the volume growth ex intra-Europe was 60%. It was again a very, very good proxy for the overall cross-border revenue growth in the quarter. So now, if we just look at October month-to-date trends, if those hold hypothetically through the rest of Q4, it would seem like cross-border revenue growth could again be around 60% this quarter, and arguably, that would be even before most of the potential benefits of the U.S. reopening kicks in. So is all that a fair characterization? Are there other moving parts should we be aware of? And can you just comment on which cross-border corridors are the highest yielding in your system?\nSachin Mehra: Yeah. So I think the answer to the first part of your question, I think, you kind of touched upon on the second part of your question, which talks about how revenues are realized on cross-border is very much a function, even in that ex intra-Europe kind of category. It will depend on every corridor. Every corridor has got a different yields, and depending on which ones come back first, which was come back after, the numbers from a cross-border revenue standpoint will kind of move around. As it relates to what we're seeing, look, I mean, I'll tell you pre-pandemic, important corridors for Mastercard included, obviously, U.S. to Canada, the U.S. to the UK, the UK to various parts in Continental Europe. These are all very important corridors. We've seen intra-Europe come back pretty nicely. The U.S. inbound is still to happen. I mean, there's a little bit happening, but there's more to come as borders open. Canada has started to open up. As you know, Canada opened up in the third quarter. We've seen signs of recovery take place in terms of inbound into Canada as well, and these are important corridors for our business. The one area which I'll say is still a little bit kind of yet to be seen is Asia-Pacific, right? In Asia-Pacific, recovery in cross-border has still been kind of somewhat muted. We'll see how borders open up there and what that kind of shapes up to be. But net-net, here is what I'll tell you from a yield standpoint, intra-Europe, low yielding, ex intra-Europe, high yielding. In the ex intra-Europe bucket, the yields vary by corridors.\nMichael Miebach: Jumaria, I think, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I think, Michael mentioned the waning impact of U.S. stimulus. I mean, we've seen the U.S. volume sort of stabilized here in terms of the growth. I'm just curious how you guys feel about the other side, which is credit rebounding? And I'm just thinking through the economic impact as lending comes back, lending-related volumes come back. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, Sanjay, let me just start on the rebound of credit. Back to changing in how people spend, start to see more in-person and more in-person certainly includes T&E, discretionary. Those are all use cases that are very much oriented toward credit. So that is what is driving that. The impact of stimulus on the debit side, we still see an elevated use of sustained use of debit going forward. So it's not a zero-sum game yet again, it's balancing out in a way that one is coming back and the other remains elevated. It really comes down to the size of the available wallet that consumers have. Sachin, you have any other thoughts on that one?\nSachin Mehra: Sanjay, I think it's interesting if you take us back to a couple of quarters ago, maybe three or four quarters ago, we talked about the same question as to what our views around credit and debit mix is going to look like, and we had kind of maintained that we think that there will be a reversion to the mean as economies come back and as discretionary spending picks up, and that's exactly what you're seeing right now, right? I mean, as people are spending more in discretionary categories, lodging, travel, restaurants, credit is definitely coming right back to the top of wallet. And we expect that as the economy continues to recover in different parts of the globe, that reversion to mean will continue, and that's kind of our view as it relates to how credit plays out over the near to medium-term.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Good. Thanks, everybody. Thank you for your questions. We are going to close the call now. I hope to see you at the Investor Community Meeting. Generally, on these calls, it's not only the analyst community listening, the investor community, it\u2019s also our staff. So I want to thank our staff for everything they have done through this quarter again. It feels like a bit of like a marathon as we turn out of COVID. See you at the ICM. Please do tune in. Thank you very much, everybody. Bye-bye.\nSachin Mehra: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 29%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 45%, both of which include a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Further, net income growth was also positively impacted by 6 ppt due to the recognition of higher one-time discrete U.S. tax benefits versus a year ago.  EPS was up 48% year-over-year to $2.37, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $361 million through October 25, 2021. So now, let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing continued strength in both debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 20%, with debit growth of 9% and credit growth of 36%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 20%, with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 16%. To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at a 121%, up 2 ppt sequentially, with credit at a 111%, up 4 ppt sequentially, and debit at a 131%, flat quarter-over-quarter. Cross-border volume was up 52% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 47% and other cross-border volumes up 60%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the pandemic last year.  In the third quarter, cross-border volume was at 97% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at a 112% and other cross-border volume at 83% of 2019 levels. Notably, cross-border volumes averaged at or above 100% of 2019 levels in the months of August and September. Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 25% year-over-year in Q3 and were at a 131% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remained strong and card-present growth continued to improve. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. In Q3, contactless transactions represented 48% of in-person purchase transactions globally, up from 45% last quarter. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 29% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth.  Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21%, while worldwide GDV grew 20%. Cross-border volume fees increased 59%, while cross-border volumes increased 52%. The 7 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 26%, generally in line with switched transaction growth of 25%. Other revenues were up 35%, including a 10 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 34%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes of transactions and new and renewed deal activity.  Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 23%, including an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, operating expenses grew 16%, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, including \u2013 sorry increased spending on advertising and marketing and increased data processing costs. Turning to Page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of October. We are seeing continued strength in growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, in part, due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we are, once again, showing 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, when we're not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So if you look at spending levels as a percentage of 2019 for switched volumes through the first three weeks of October, the recent trends have continued with overall switched volumes at a 134% of 2019 levels, up 3 ppt versus Q3.  The U.S. has held steady with some moderation in growth from earlier levels due to the roll-off of stimulus, and outside the U.S., we're seeing continued improvement. Trends in switched transactions remains steady and are generally tracking the trends we're seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, as I noted earlier, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 were back to pre-pandemic levels, starting in August. That improving trend has continued through the first three weeks of October, and we are now at a 105% of 2019 levels. This improvement is driven by increases in both travel and non-travel cross-border volumes. As it relates to travels, we have seen it picking up in all regions, notably within and to Europe and recently into Canada as well. Turning to Page 9, I wanted to really share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, our deal momentum and service lines continued to position us well for growth and diversify our revenues, and we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives. Domestic spending levels remain healthy, and we are encouraged by the recent resurgence in international travel. We are optimistic about the announced relaxation of border restrictions in places like the U.S. and the UK, given that we have seen travel pickup when borders have opened in the past.  Further, the airlines have recently reported increased travel bookings, including long-haul travel. With this as context, assuming domestic and cross-border spending trends relative to 2019 continue to improve, we would expect Q4 net revenues to grow at a low 20s rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, spending recovered progressively in 2020, so we will be facing a more difficult comp of approximately 7 ppt in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It is also important to point out that this is just one potential scenario as the level of uncertainty remains related to the pandemic and therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. In terms of operating expenses for the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of low double digits versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects our disciplined approach to expense management while advancing our innovation agenda across payments, services, and promising new adjacencies and continued investment in brand and product marketing. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to now have closed on the CipherTrace transaction, and we expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue and 8 ppt to operating expense growth in Q4. This reflects the integration of several acquisitions in the open banking, digital identity, and real-time payment areas. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be about 0.5 ppt headwind to both net revenue and operating expenses in Q4. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $120 million per quarter, given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the fourth quarter. Thanks, and I hope you will be able to participate in our Virtual Investment Community Meeting on November 10th. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. And I'll just add on to what Michael just said. As it relates to your question around specifically on the threat of closed loops, look, we're big believers in the benefits of the open loop system, which we believe is very powerful. I mean, for the reasons Michael just mentioned, we bring consumers at scale. We bring global acceptance. I mean, we have north of 80 million merchant acceptance points, and this is growing rapidly, and the cost of acceptance is very competitive. And when you take that, along with what Michael talked about around the various technologies and the expertise we bring, everything from digital solutions, fraud solutions, merchant support, processing assets, now most recently, Mastercard Installments, that's a very compelling proposition to go and look in our view, which is why we believe that if people wish to scale, the best way to go on is open loop, which is why we've kind of given investment in the business very heavily to drive down that back. Sure. So Bryan, I'll go ahead and take that. First, I know you're asking specifically about cross-border travel, but I just want to kind of put the headline out there, which is for cross-border, as a whole, we have seen very strong growth in Q3 as you've seen. And yes, travel has been a big component of that. Specifically, travel between Q2 and Q3 has gone from what was 48% of 2019 levels to 72% in Q3. And now, in the first three weeks of October, it's tracking more like at 77%. And, look, what this signals to us very clearly is if people can travel, they will travel, and I think that's really, really important to recognize. And then when you overlay that with what's going on in the nature of announcements, around opening of borders, more specifically, the U.S. has recently talked about inbound travel into the U.S. In fact, I think, just a couple of days ago, they laid out the actual details around how people can come into the U.S. I mean, you combine that with the fact that Europe has opened up, the UK is showing good signals of opening up. Even in Asia, we're starting to see corridors between Singapore and Australia, Singapore and India. These corridors are all starting to open up. These are all encouraging signs for us from a cross-border travel standpoint. And we remain optimistic on that front, especially given that if those borders open up and they come with what would be light burdens from a quarantining standpoint, which is what we're seeing right now. People have said that they will travel and they've demonstrated that through Q3. So net-net, here is what I'll tell you, I think travel is something which people want to do. They're showing that willingness to do it. Now it's a question of which are the other countries which we will open up in addition to the borders I've just talked about. And you're reflecting \u2013 you're seeing this to be reflected in the bookings, which airlines are boarding as well. So we remain optimistic on this front. I can't really tell you specifically which day or which month it's going to reach up to a 100% of 2019 levels. But generally, the trend is more moving in the right direction there. And just one final point I'll make. You remember over the last few quarters, we've talked about how in anticipation for the return of travel, we have been investing in bolstering our capabilities from a travel standpoint. And we've been doing this actually for many years now, but even through the pandemic, we've been winning deals in travel as also our teams have been very focused on the ground in terms of making sure we're optimizing our travel portfolio the best we can. So we're ready to actually jump on this as soon as we start to see the strength come back, which we are seeing now. Sure. So George, couple of things I kind of just point out on rebates and incentives. I think you know all of this, but I'll just kind of state it here. A few things. We think that incentives is very dependent on the timing of deals and how volume and mix plays out. And it goes to your point around what the mix is between domestic and cross-border and how you model that and bring that in there. In Q4, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially due to increased deal activity. This is pretty normal for us in Q4, and that's what you should expect also going into Q4 of this year. So at the end of the day, a lot is going to depend upon, like I said, what the mix is going to look like. We have said in the past that cross-border revenues are less indexed from a rebates and incentive standpoint. So again, depending on mix between domestic and cross-border, that will inform our kind of views around where rebates and incentives will go on a going-forward basis. Of course, new and renewed deals, which we remain very active in the market, are also going to be a contributing factor. Sure. So Tien-Tsin, this will not take effect until 2023, and Michael talked about approximately 400 million Maestro cards globally. Again, this is Europe-specific. There's been a trend which is currently been underway for some time now, and the reality is it's about not issuing new Maestro cards. Existing Maestro cards will continue to be in operation. We've been on this migration path. It makes imminent sense. It just provides better utility for our products in an increasingly digital world. So the reality is I know of view this as a step in the right direction, and we've been on this journey, we'll continue down this path. Sure. So Darrin, I'll take your question on inflation. So look, I mean, there's been obviously a lot of talk recently about high inflation levels, whether it's permanent, whether it's long-term, whether it's just transitionary. The reality is the structure of our business model is quite conducive because of the way we price, right? I mean, we've got basis points. We've got cents per transaction as it relates to how we kind of price. So we kind of view the following, which is to the extent that inflation is moderate, right? We think that \u2013 of that to be a positive tailwind kind of to our business.  Again, gradual and moderate inflation is going to be helpful. And the reason I bring that up is any sort of shock to the economy, i.e., any sort of hyperinflationary event oftentimes comes with drastic measures from an interest rate standpoint and comes with cost pressures, which come along with that. So to the extend it's moderate, it's moderately kind of positive for our business. The other thing I would say is it's important to actually see in the basket of goods and services what are the products and services, which are subject to inflation and what is the amount of electronification of the flows, which have taken place and relevance to our business.  So to the extent there's inflation, general inflation taking place in categories which are unrelated to card payments. I mean, that's kind of a net non-event for us. To the extent it's on things which relate to consumer spending, which have been electronified and goes back to my point around moderate inflation being a mild positive here. Hello. Yes, and Dan, I'll just add to that. Just we've got to remember, right, there's a sizable TAM out there. And a fair amount of that TAM is likely not going to be able to be reached by card products. This is where our multi-rail philosophy and strategy as well as our ability to provide choice across various rails, one of which would be an open banking rail used for payment services. It's very helpful because it helps open up the TAM, which is available to us from what used to be primarily card-focused to much more than card-focused, and we do see that opportunity come through here in open banking as well. Sure, Bob. Why don't I take that. So, look, I mean, the value prop we used to deliver through cross-border payments on our carded products, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic is exactly the same. So we don't expect that the economic returns, which they will generate, should be any different, given that the value we delivered previously, if anything, has only gotten better over a period of time with more electronification of flows taking place. To your point around several other account-to-account capabilities, which are there in the cross-border space, the reality is we're participating in them today. But it happened to be going after flows, which are not carded flows. They're not point-of-sales flows. They happen to be more in the nature of business-to-business payments. We do that with our \u2013 if you remember, we acquired a Company called Transfast, in addition to the fact that we have our capabilities from HomeSend. The combined capability of that is our cross-border Send capabilities, which is account-to-account cross-border payments. And we'll participate in those flows, but those are separate and distinct from what goes on at the point of sale with our card products today. So net-net, I kind of view the whole cross-border space as a positive for us as and when travel comes back from a card standpoint. And in the meantime, we continue to actually plant flags in different parts of the world with the reach we've established on our B2B flows from a cross-border standpoint. Yeah. So I think the answer to the first part of your question, I think, you kind of touched upon on the second part of your question, which talks about how revenues are realized on cross-border is very much a function, even in that ex intra-Europe kind of category. It will depend on every corridor. Every corridor has got a different yields, and depending on which ones come back first, which was come back after, the numbers from a cross-border revenue standpoint will kind of move around. As it relates to what we're seeing, look, I mean, I'll tell you pre-pandemic, important corridors for Mastercard included, obviously, U.S. to Canada, the U.S. to the UK, the UK to various parts in Continental Europe. These are all very important corridors. We've seen intra-Europe come back pretty nicely. The U.S. inbound is still to happen. I mean, there's a little bit happening, but there's more to come as borders open. Canada has started to open up. As you know, Canada opened up in the third quarter. We've seen signs of recovery take place in terms of inbound into Canada as well, and these are important corridors for our business. The one area which I'll say is still a little bit kind of yet to be seen is Asia-Pacific, right? In Asia-Pacific, recovery in cross-border has still been kind of somewhat muted. We'll see how borders open up there and what that kind of shapes up to be. But net-net, here is what I'll tell you from a yield standpoint, intra-Europe, low yielding, ex intra-Europe, high yielding. In the ex intra-Europe bucket, the yields vary by corridors. Sanjay, I think it's interesting if you take us back to a couple of quarters ago, maybe three or four quarters ago, we talked about the same question as to what our views around credit and debit mix is going to look like, and we had kind of maintained that we think that there will be a reversion to the mean as economies come back and as discretionary spending picks up, and that's exactly what you're seeing right now, right? I mean, as people are spending more in discretionary categories, lodging, travel, restaurants, credit is definitely coming right back to the top of wallet. And we expect that as the economy continues to recover in different parts of the globe, that reversion to mean will continue, and that's kind of our view as it relates to how credit plays out over the near to medium-term. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. So let me start by giving you the highlights of the quarter. Strong revenue and earnings growth continued. The net revenue up 29% and EPS up 48% versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On this same basis, quarter three net revenues are now 11% above pre-COVID levels in 2019. We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending and overall cross-border volumes are now back at 2019 levels, though there still remains significant rules for growth in cross-border travel. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities with good progress on the product and deal fronts this quarter, and we're excited about our acquisition of CipherTrace in the crypto services area and our planned acquisition of Aiia in open banking. So those are the highlights. Looking at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to improve, even though economies are facing supply chain constraints, rising energy prices, and some other inflationary pressures. According to our quarter three SpendingPulse report, which is based on wall payment types, including cash and check, U.S. retail sales, ex auto, ex gas were up 5% versus a year ago and 12% versus 2019, reflecting the return to in-person shopping in the ongoing e-commerce strength. SpendingPulse also indicated an overall European retail sales in quarter three were up 5% and 6% versus 2019. As it relates to COVID specifically, the outlook continues to get better with case numbers generally improving, new therapeutics in the pipeline, progress in vaccinations, and businesses becoming more agile in the phase of remaining restrictions. We're also seeing a general trend toward the opening of travel corridors, notably inbound into the U.S. and some easing of restrictions in Asia. Now turning to our business. While the pandemic is not fully behind us, we're now in the growth phase in most markets domestically and in many markets in cross-border spending as well. We will, therefore, turn the page, and move beyond the four-phased framework that guided us from the last 19 months and focus on managing the business for the growth opportunities ahead of us. Looking at Mastercard's spending trends, Switched volumes improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw particular strength in consumer and commercial credit. Debit spend remains elevated, although it has moderated in recent weeks in part due to waning stimulus benefits. In terms of how people are spending, card-present volumes continue to improve as people are getting out and shopping more while we're still seeing sustained strength in card-not-present spend.  So regardless of whether people want to shop online or in-person, our solutions support that choice and position us well to participate in both trends. Now let's take a look at cross-border. Overall, cross-border returned to 2019 levels in August, driven by improvements in consumer and commercial travel, as well as the ongoing strength of cross-border card-not-present spending ex travel. Our cross-border travel improved from 48% of 2019 levels in the second quarter to 72% this quarter, with substantial upside potential still remaining as and when borders open. Against this backdrop, we're investing in the growth of our business, including the enhancing ends of our leading technology capabilities, like expanding our network edge to connect directly with our customers through the cloud, providing faster and easier access to our products and services. And, of course, we remain focused on our strategic priorities: number one, rolling out core products while driving the shift to digital; two, differentiating and diversifying with our services; and three, leveraging our multi-rail capabilities to offer choice across payment applications.  Now, let's take them one-by-one and turn to how we're growing our core products and driving the shift through digital: through Mastercard Installments, by winning core deals and by continuing our momentum in the fintech space. First, let me tell you about our recently announced Mastercard Installments, our scalable, open loop, buy-now-pay-later solution. Mastercard Installments is differentiated in that it enables banks, lenders, fintechs, and wallets to seamlessly bring buy-now-pay-later solutions to consumers and merchants at scale and in a secure, tokenized manner. With little to no integration for merchants, our solution avoids the need for lenders to engage merchants one-by-one to roll this out, enables them to deliver more payment options to more consumers faster.  Our solution brings choice at scale, delivered through the Mastercard network. Our consumers will be able to access buy-now-pay-later offers through their bank's mobile banking app at the point of checkout and soon directly through Click to Pay. The embedded power of Finicity will help lenders with credit decisioning and enable consumers to easily choose different repayment options. Mastercard Installments will power our core payments and enable us to provide additional value through services, such as data analytics, loyalty, and fraud tools. We've seen strong interest from players on all sides of the ecosystem and look forward to growing our partnerships in this area. As always, we remain focused on continuing to grow share, and we've won deals across the globe this quarter.  In the UK, we're partnering with Chase as the preferred debit partner of their new digital retail bank. In Canada, we've extended our exclusive co-brand with Costco Canada. And in Brazil, we signed a deal with AutoPass to issue more than 10 million cards to mass transit users in the Sao Paulo area, and along with that, open contactless acceptance across their subway trains and city buses. We're also building our leading position with fintechs and mobile money providers. Here are a few recent examples. PayPal has extended its PayPal Business Debit card into our four markets in Europe. PayPal will also directly leverage Mastercard Send for domestic wallet cash-outs and P2P transactions in the U.S. We're partnering with Vodafone in Egypt across all of their mobile money use cases, including cash-outs, P2P, and bill payments. We expanded our strategic partnerships with Yandex in Russia and we'll be their preferred international partner for all of their fintech initiatives. And Finterra, an innovative market leader that connects U.S. banks and fintechs to get cards and financial products into the market, will leverage our digital-first Finicity, Mastercard Send, and cybersecurity assets. Now, shifting to services. Our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in enabling many of the wins I just mentioned. They, of course, also diversify our business. We had many wins in this area in this quarter. Starting with the cybersecurity space. Ethoca is helping multiple players, including AT&T and Mercado Libre, reduce charge-backs through collaboration, thereby creating purchase transparency.  Banco de Bogota\u0301 is using our artificial intelligence capabilities to improve consumer experiences, increased profitability, and identifying new opportunities. In Europe, the term is leveraging NuData's behavioral biometrics to help thousands of new banks authenticate online transactions. Data analytics. The tourism agencies in Greece, Hungary, and elsewhere are using services like tourism insights and managed services to gather greater visibility of trends and drive deeper insights to support the tourism campaigns. In the UAE, HSBC is leveraging our test-and-learn capabilities to innovate, experiment and roll out new products for better customer engagement. And we're having success in the loyalty space with our innovative digital solutions, driving wins with players like the global fitness chain, Barry's, and First and Saudi National Bank. Now, let's turn to the progress we've made in offering choice to consumers across payment applications with our multi-real capabilities, including open banking, B2B, and crypto. In open banking, we're happy about our planned acquisition of Aiia. Aiia is a leading European open banking player, whose platform expertise, strong API connectivity, and payment capabilities complement our existing open banking assets. We will combine Aiia's European footprint with Finicity's connectivity in the U.S. and our expansion into other markets like Australia. This will allow us to extend each organization's best-in-class capabilities, such as credit decisioning, credit scoring, account information services, and payment applications across markets. Talking about markets, we continue to make progress with our open banking products in Europe with players like Entercard, one of Scandinavia's leading credit card companies. In the U.S., Finicity is working with UGO to enable account opening verifications, along with future plans to expand into payments.  In B2B, we continued to expand the Track Business Payment Service network with key partners like JPMorgan Chase, as well as merchant acquirers such as Moneris, the largest acquirer and leading processor of B2B transactions in Canada, and Priority Commercial Payments, a leading payments technology Company in commercial payment solutions in the U.S. We're also adding new functionality to Track DBS and are partnering with Demica to launch a supply chain finance capability. This functionality empowers payment agents to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital directly through the Mastercard Track DBS platform. And in the UK, HSBC will be the first to issue a Mastercard Track Card to Account Transfer product, an innovative B2B payment solution that allows businesses to use their commercial card program to make payments with any supplier, even if that supplier does not accept card payments, again, a true multi-rail offering. And finally, in the crypto space, we're making it easier for crypto players to connect to our network. We signed up a number of new crypto wallet providers and exchanges this quarter, including Bit2Me, Mobile Power UK, Kanga by ZEN.com, Coinmotion and CoinJar,. Our crypto program, which is based on three principles of engagement, allows consumers to easily buy crypto assets with their Mastercard, spend their crypto balances wherever Mastercard is accepted, cash out their proceeds with Mastercard Send and earn rewards in the form of crypto or even NFT. We're also seeing a growing services opportunity in this space.  Earlier this month, we acquired CipherTrace, a security and fraud monitoring Company with expertise, technologies, insights into more than 900 cryptocurrencies. Our recently announced agreement with Bakkt will also add to our expanding crypto services portfolio. So let me sum this up one more time. We delivered strong revenue earnings growth this quarter. We're seeing continued strength in domestic spending in most markets. And while overall cross-border volumes are back at 2019 levels, there remains significant room for growth in cross-border travel. We're executing against our strategic priorities with good progress of the product and deal front, as you heard, we're doing all of that while carefully managing our expenses. That's it for me. Sachin, over to you. Thank you, Lisa. Let me take that question first. So buy-now-pay-later, exciting space. We talked about it for years, invested with our own installment proposition, facing off to banks five, six years ago, the partnerships, and now as of late Mastercard Installments, as you said. You saw a strong lineup of initial partners, bank partners initially. I mean, the thought is to remind everybody, again, here is a proposition that we have built into our network. So this is really delivered with no hassle for merchants or for lenders at the point of sale. So the reaction from banks are strong. Here in the U.S., that's where our lineup of U.S. partners - lending partners was.  But I've spent time on the roads over the last three weeks in Europe and similar conversation emerged there. It was just a couple of days after the announcement over Italy and banks were saying, \"Wow, this makes a lot of sense. It's really avoiding a significant headache for us and get into a space that we all believe is important from a consumer perspective.\" On the fintech side, fintech lenders, novel lenders, we lean in with fintechs, some call them disruptors. We feel these are partnerships, we should enable anybody who wants to come on our network, and we're certainly marketing that to ensure that we have the full breadth of what the market has in terms of lending offering. That's going to be good for consumers and merchants. So watch this space, more to come. But I think, it's a very compelling proposition. Right. So Don, great question. Choice and payments has been a theme for Mastercard now for, I think, basically always, but specifically with our investments in the account-to-account space over the last six years. So we see the demand for merchants and from consumers. For the consumer, it makes sense because you get all your spend into \u2013 you can see it all on one bank account. That would be one aspect to why consumers might like that. Merchants like it for choice and higher baskets of more sales. So the interest is clearly there. We've been on this journey for a while and we don't necessarily see this as a. I mean, that's certainly something to watch.  But we look at it as an opportunity. We say this could be additional volumes that we've not been involved with. This could be what was historically the consumer finance business. This would be something that was just direct debit business that we've seen in some European countries and so forth. So that's broadly how we look at it. We build a full stack around this that helps to get your money from A to B, but that's just half of the story. Probably not even half of the story because it's the whole experience that really matters. You got to have the security. What happens if you do a push payment and you want your money back? Some of those best practices that we've learned over the last decades in cards is what we're intending to build here. So it's interesting to see blogs out there on how account to account might look like. We have four years now in Pay by Account in the UK. We've got those learnings. We're ahead of the market here very clearly knowing what works, what the economic model should look like, what's the proposition that would really make a difference for merchants, for acquirers who will be all playing in this space. So I don't see a disintermediation risk, I see an opportunity for us to extend our partnerships and gain new flows. Right. And coming back to being on the road for quite a few weeks, you start to see also the mix changing. While initially, this was leisure travel, you start to see business travel really kicking in. So that gives us another signal that really the pent-up demand is coming across all channels. People want to see their customers, they wanted to see their family first, now they want to see their customers. It's happening. Sure. Hi, Tien-Tsin, let me start on that and then Sachin can comment on the P&L side of things. So we've been on this journey of Maestro to Debit Mastercard conversions around the world. You heard us talk about this for a number of years. In Europe, we've really made substantial progress on that front over the years, and we felt it would be important to put a stake in the ground and give assurance to consumers as well as other ecosystem participants, banks, sales force, banking associations of when we see the end of life for the Maestro product. Why are we doing that? We're doing it because here's 450 million consumers who cannot use a Maestro card online because it doesn't work online.  Debit Mastercard is now in its latest form available in a digital-first form. You don't even need a physical card any longer if that's what you want to do, or if you want it just contactless, it gives you the full breadth of choice. So that is why we're doing this. The timing is right. The reaction was essentially, okay, it has to do in some of the leading European tabloids, we made it onto the front page with that news. It is big news in Europe as you rightly said. But it's just a right thing to do. And what we've seen from a performance perspective, it is a more engaging payment tool in your hands, and people use it across all channels, and that's what we want. So we're very encouraged about that. And then Sachin, you can look at the P&L side of thing. Right. And one last aspect here is this - what we've learned here is over the last couple of years as we are moving the shift from Maestro to Debit Mastercard is how do we use this as an opportunity to not only retain our business that we have on the debit front, but also to expand our business on the debit front, so we don't have any concerns on that front. All right. Now, Darrin, on your second question, structural changes are they here to last, what makes a trend? Fascinating question. I don't want to upfront the Investor Day, but since you asked the question, I'll give you a couple of highlights on how we're thinking about that. So, the first thing is it helps to understand the psyche of the changing consumer of the small business, so everybody who's kind of in the payment space as an end user and we now have 19 months of studies looking at this, and the numbers have really not changed. Somewhere around 70% of people and business are saying, more digital banking will be what they will be doing going forward. More online shopping is what they will be doing going forward and more contactless. So the secular trend that was playing in our favor for years has clearly accelerated. I mean, if you just look at this quarter's numbers, we talked about sustained e-commerce strength while in-person shopping is coming back. So behavior is truly sticking. So that is - I think that's the most fundamental point that we're seeing coming through. The race to this digital economy it's on. And what that also means is a lot of players want to come in. So there are structural changes in the sense of that the competitive playing field is opening up. More partners are coming in, which for B2B2C player like us is a great opportunity to facilitate the entry of all of these partners, so that's what we're doing. Then you start to look around and say, \"Well, who else is looking at this, these kind of trends and these kind of developments?\" Most notably governments. Governments are looking at this and they have found that over the last 19 months, that payments is indeed a national critical infrastructure. So that comes with government engagement, which is not always necessarily positive. But what we're seeing is, is a real drive to modernize payment infrastructure, and that is where we are invited to the table because we're a true multi-rail network. And they're saying, \"Hey, you're locally invested, you're a locally relevant partner. Let's talk about how do we make this better in our country.\" So that is certainly a structural change as Tien-Tsin asked earlier about new payment flows coming in, open banking, et cetera., in Europe. So we're playing on all of those trends going forward.  So I think that is what is happening. You could - I could go on for a while longer. B2B, clearly, digitizing supply chains is a drive that is in focus. We're seeing that. Data analytics and cybersecurity, that's the last point I want to make on this. With the race towards a more digital economy, there's going to be more data that is available, more business will seek to use that data and run their business in a better way to find more customers. Our test and learn capabilities, our data analytics capabilities help on that. So again, that's a structural trend that's helpful and the same applies for cyber and security. More digital transactions need to be made safe, more people need to be authenticated as they use these tools, again, that plays into our offering. So structural change is really driven by COVID accelerating the race to digital. David, let me start on that, and maybe Sachin wants to chime in. So the journey towards account-to-account in Europe, I think it's still early days. So if you look at how PSD2 has rolled out in Europe starting in September 2019, including the strong customer authentication, has been a long journey. Dates have been moved on multiple occasions to give time to the industry to get this right, and get right means that the transaction isn't so secure that nobody can use it any longer. So the trade-off between consumer experience and security is actually found in a balanced way, and what we're seeing in our engagements in Europe is that balance is starting to be struck. So we will reach a point where such strong customer authentication in cards, as well as in other forms of payments will be actually a reality in Europe. So that's the first thing I want to say. When it comes to open banking specifically, so there has been over the last two years, really a focus on driving connectivity in Europe in terms of getting the open banking ecosystem stood up. That's exactly why we put out in our connectivity product in June 2019. That was the first lead into the region, and we've been quite busy with that. Use cases emerging on the basis of that really started in 2020, the UK being ahead of Continental Europe on that while this was still one Europe and UK is still pushing ahead. You heard us talk about Lloyd's on card repayments, about our partnership with Tesco. So the payment capability part of all open banking is really leading in the UK and here our proposition is very well positioned. So we start to see that. And I see the way it's coming over to Continental Europe as connectivity is now there. Our acquisition of Aiia is perfectly timed here. We expect to close this by the end of the year to not bring in additional- not only bring in additional connectivity, but also additional payment capabilities because I do see. This is not just a data capability, it's a big data, a kind of a data play, account aggregation, personal finance management, and so forth, but it's also a payment opportunity. Yes, Harshita. So always an exciting topic, and we could not have an earnings call without talking about crypto, so I'm happy you brought it up. Looking at this from a number of perspectives other than that, there's a lot going on in the space. We are pretty clear on how we want to play in this. So the first is we see significant volumes in terms of people actually investing in crypto and selling crypto. So as an asset class, there's a lot going on, and I think, we have a role to play to facilitate consumers wanting to do that, if that's what they choose to do.  So these partnership programs on exchanges, crypto exchanges and wallet partners and so forth, have been quite important for us and that is good from a volume perspective, there is real activity. When it comes to crypto as a payment tool, then we take a somewhat differentiated view on that versus we just step into that. We're saying at this point in time, the most likely chance of this kind of technology to work for payments is issued through a government in a form of Central Bank digital currency. We've said that on a couple of calls before, and we said we will make our network ready to do that as and when our government is ready to put out a Central Bank digital currency, then it will exist alongside the dollar or the euro in Settlement Currency in our network.  So we've done that, but that's easily said. How will the government test that? How will a country figure out between the private sector banks and the governments how to do this? That's where our sandbox comes in, so we can provide a safe space for government and private sector banks to figure out how that would actually work. Questions like the last mile, how do you bring utility in to the hands of your citizens if you put out a Central Bank digital currency acceptance questions and so forth. So facilitating investments as an asset class, we do that and we get ready for CBDC. Should there be a private sector stable coin, we might also do that, but we have very strict principles on when to do this and when not.  Now, let me talk about the CipherTrace for a moment, because this space is already an interesting space in so many ways, questions on data privacy, questions on authentication. We just touched on that in the context of Europe and strong customer authentication. We have to expect the Europeans will say, \"Well, strong customer authentication will, of course, play a role in Crypto transactions as well,\" which is where we always lead with security and trust. I mean, that is really synonymous with the name of Mastercard when it comes to payments that we have to do the same role. So it's a massive services opportunity.  CipherTrace, 900 cryptocurrencys. What does CipherTrace actually do? They drive compliance and AML checks into crypto transactions. We can't run fast enough right now to get into the space because a lot of other people are deep into crypto and these questions are not resolved. So asset class, CBDCs and services opportunity, those are three ways that we feel we want to play and we need to play, and we have the differentiated assets to do so. Dan, so I think I touched a little bit on an earlier question that we had on this topic. So here's a blog post that describes account-to-account. We have account-to-account technology really since the acquisition of Vocalink, and we've learned how that works. We like it because it's an additional choice that has provided to consumer and to merchants. But we also have all the learnings, and the learning go around like, how do you create acceptance into that? How do you make it easy for our merchant? How do you actually convince a consumer that actually likes the card proposition? So all of that, it is about standing up an ecosystem.  So, what we believe is this should be something that is built into our network, into our multi-rail capabilities, and it's actually how we're approaching it. So, we're leaning into this. I don't see it as a disruption. That's been our stated strategy, and we have five years of learning, and I think that puts us ahead of the curve to make this a reality. I think this is an interesting alternative when it comes to consumer payments in store, and we have it. We build it. It's for us to really figure out whether the economics settle, what other capabilities that are currently built into our card franchise can we extend into the world of account-to-account payments, for example, charge-backs, those kind of data protection and so forth.  So that's the direction that we are taking. Not really a disintermediation question, an interesting blog, the good things we've done in reality. Sure. Jumaria, I think, we have time for one last question. Yes, Sanjay, let me just start on the rebound of credit. Back to changing in how people spend, start to see more in-person and more in-person certainly includes T&E, discretionary. Those are all use cases that are very much oriented toward credit. So that is what is driving that. The impact of stimulus on the debit side, we still see an elevated use of sustained use of debit going forward. So it's not a zero-sum game yet again, it's balancing out in a way that one is coming back and the other remains elevated. It really comes down to the size of the available wallet that consumers have. Sachin, you have any other thoughts on that one? All right. Good. Thanks, everybody. Thank you for your questions. We are going to close the call now. I hope to see you at the Investor Community Meeting. Generally, on these calls, it's not only the analyst community listening, the investor community, it's also our staff. So I want to thank our staff for everything they have done through this quarter again. It feels like a bit of like a marathon as we turn out of COVID. See you at the ICM. Please do tune in. Thank you very much, everybody. Bye-bye."

Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are the highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On that same basis, quarter two net revenues are now 10% over 2019 levels, even though international travel is in the early stages of recovery, which is showing the strength of our diversified revenue streams. Domestic switched volumes are well above pre-pandemic levels with all regions growing at a healthy rate. We are seeing improvements in both domestic and cross-border travel with significant upside potential. Within this context. we're making progress against our strategic objectives and have expanded our relationships with key partners like Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Stripe, and Verizon. Let's dive in. Looking first at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to show improved in-store sales and strength in e-commerce. According to our quarter two SpendingPulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales ex auto, ex gas were up 14% versus a year ago and up 10% versus 2019, reflecting improved consumer mobility and some residual effects of fiscal stimulus. SpendingPulse also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter two were up 13% versus a year ago and 6% versus 2019. The vaccine rollout has scaled in the U.S., UK, and Germany and several other countries with over 35 countries now reporting that over 50% of their populations are at least partially vaccinated. Broadening this effort is critical and will of course take time. Turning to our business, specifically in the four-phased framework we established for managing through the COVID environment, we believe that most markets are at a growth phase domestically as cross-border spend is now starting to normalize, the border restrictions are being relaxed. Looking at Mastercard spending trends. Switched volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across all products. Debit spend remains elevated and we are seeing further recovery in credit, driven in part by the return of travel and increased discretionary spending. This recovery led by consumer credit, but it's important to note that commercial credit is also improving and has now reached pre-pandemic levels as well. In terms of how people are spending, they are definitely getting out more as we are seeing improvement in card-present spending, particularly in the travel, retail, and restaurant categories, while e-commerce continues to be strong. Now turning to cross-border. Cross-border card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to be very strong. On the travel front itself, it is clear people want to travel and they do so where and when able to. We've seen domestically and across borders where there are limited restrictions. For example, we're seeing strength between the U.S. and Latin America as well as an increase in travel within Europe. Our industry reports, there has been a recent increase in bookings for travel between the U.S. and Europe and the quarantine requirements for entry into Canada are starting to be relaxed so that's a further opportunity. Overall, we expect more borders to open in the second half of the year depending, of course, on infection rates, including the recent variants and progress on the vaccination front. Against this improving backdrop, we are focusing on our strategic priorities: one, rolling out core products supported by our services; second, driving digital enablement both in-store and online; third, ensuring the ecosystem is safe and secure; and fourth, providing choice through our multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long-term by continuing to manage our expenses carefully. Let's look at them one by one. First off, we're driving growth in our core products and the leveraging our comprehensive services to do so, working with new and existing customers to solve their pain points both in payments and beyond. We're well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel, and remain focused on building on our strength in this area by expanding relationships with our travel partners. For example, we have renewed our exclusive co-brand with JetBlue Airlines in the U.S. We also entered into a long-term global partnership with Cathay Pacific and Asia Miles, who will migrate their existing co-brand portfolio to Mastercard. In the Middle East, we have expanded our British Airways co-brand; and in Latin America, we are now the preferred brand for LATAM Airlines. It is important to note that our services played a critical role in enabling all these deals, including our data analytics, Test & Learn, loyalty, consulting, and cybersecurity solutions. Of course, we also continue to drive growth in the core outside of travel. Here are a few examples. We are excited about our partnership with Citi to launch the new Citi Custom Cash Mastercard, offering card members cashback in the top eligible spend category. JPMorgan Chase, we've extended and deepened our agreement in the commercial space and we have renewed our Master brand relationship with Chase in the U.S. We also continue to partner closely with community banks throughout the U.S., including a flip of First Southern National Bank\u2019s debit portfolio to become their exclusive network brand. On the digital front, we\u2019re well positioned to drive the acceleration of the secular shift with our digital capabilities no matter how consumers want to shop in store, online, or both. As consumers return to in-person shopping, adoption of contactless continues to grow. In the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 45% of in-person purchase transactions globally according to our switched transactions, that's up from 37% a year ago. At the same time, e-commerce continues its strong growth and we are providing consumers choice on how they want to pay online. For example, Click to Pay, which improves the guest checkout experience, is now rolled out in over 10 markets and we continue to launch a significant new merchants, such as the Canadian Tire Group. On to the Buy Now Pay Later space in Australia, we are partnering with Citi and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to offer instalments to consumers wherever Mastercard is accepted and whether in store or online we are securing and streamlining the consumer experience through our tokenization services. Tokenized transactions across in store, online, and in-app surpassed 1 billion per month throughout the second quarter. We continue to partner with major digital players to expand the reach of our digital capabilities. For example, we just entered a strategic partnership with Stripe to give business a small control over how they spend their money by enabling Stripe users to create, manage, and distribute virtual and physical cards for small business, commercial and consumer across credit, debit, and prepaid. We also entered a partnership with Verizon to bring 5G innovation to the global payments industry. Leveraging our services and insights and pairing Mastercard solution with Verizon's 5G connectivity will allow us to create better experiences from the checkout lines being built, even to how businesses are run. The increased capacity and reduced latency of 5G will enable us to take another step towards making every device a commerce device. Now, on to securing the ecosystem. As more merchants and consumer shift to digital, the importance of keeping the ecosystem safe and secure is paramount and is creating a strong demand for our cyber-solutions. In addition to organic growth, the number of our acquisitions in the space continue to perform well. For example, Ethoca had strong deal momentum, including a fraud and dispute management agreement with EBANK, a payment solution provider operating across 15 countries in Latin America. RiskRecon, which monitors and accesses customers\u2019 third-party cybersecurity risk is now scanning millions of companies globally up from thousands when we acquired them at the end of 2019.  NuData is providing biometric fraud prevention tools to Major League Baseball and we very happy to advance our digital identity capabilities with the acquisition of Ekata that is now closed and off to a strong start on the deal front. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to our initiatives focused on addressing a broader set of payment tools with our multi-rail capabilities. The key here is to provide choice. Essentially, the right tool for the job. There are multi-rail approach, including our expertise and capabilities in cards, real-time payments, and support for digital currencies, we are able to deploy the right combination of assets to meet our customers' needs. And more than just having this range of capabilities, we're making these solutions work together seamlessly. Let me give you a few examples. In B2B, we're making progress with Mastercard Track, building out our global open-loop network by working with buyer agents and supplier agents, such as banks, software companies, and ERP vendors. On the bank side, we're very excited to have signed Barclaycard payments. So we'll use track to connect their global business customers on both the buyer and the supplier side ecosystem across multiple rails. You can also find FreshBooks, a premier accounting software platform with customers in over 100 countries. In the Bill Pay space, we continue to scale the Mastercard's Bill Pay Exchange, which leverages our real-time payment capabilities to provide a transformative mobile first experience to bill payments with Citi Treasury and Trade solutions now connecting into the platform. The Mastercard Send continued to penetrate a variety of new payment flows beyond traditional card payments, this enabled dozens of use cases and hundreds of programs across every region of the world. For example, we are partnering with innovative digital messaging platforms to offer P2P services to consumers. Today use of WhatsApp in Brazil and transfer money directly in app leveraging Mastercard's Send. We're also partnering with MoneyGram and Checkout enable near real-time cross border P2P transfers across Europe. And on the B2C front, we continue to support the fast-growing Gig economy and then partnering with Payfare to enable instant earnings payouts, some of the largest Gig platform in the U.S.. Through open banking, Mastercard is empowering people and businesses across the globe to easily and securely gain access to their financial data to create new opportunities for themselves. In the U.S., our efforts with Finicity are running ahead of expectations as we continue to enhance direct API connectivity for banks and fintechs. For example, we're partnering with Jack Henry to enable consumers to bank at more than 400 community financial institutions to use its digital platform to access use and benefit from their own financial data. Navy Federal Credit Union recently signed direct data access agreements with Finicity. Finicity is also leveraging data connections to launch new products and new verticals, such as its mortgage verification service. And finally, in terms of crypto currency; we're making it easier for cryptocurrency wallets to connect seamlessly to our network through pilot Paxos, Circle and Evolve Bank & Trust, which simplifies the conversion of crypto into fiat. Secondly, we're partnering with ConsenSys, the Ethereum software engineering firm to accelerate the development of crypto applications and services for all our customers. Now, summing all of this up, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, benefiting from our revenue diversification efforts. We believe that most markets are on a growth phase domestically and there is upside potential in cross-border travel. We're winning significant new deals and we continue to focus on our strategic priorities to drive growth over the long term. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Now turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on currency neutral to basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investment. Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy, strong recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 36%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 37% year-over-year to $1.95, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution on share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.7 million worth of stock and an additional $398 million through July 26, 2021. So, now let's turn to page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 33% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 34% with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 50%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 32% with debit growth of 39% and credit growth of 25%. Gross dollar volume about 58% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes up 48% and other Cross-border volumes up 71%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the debts of the pandemic last year. In the second quarter, Cross-Border volume was 87% of 2019 levels with intra-Europe almost back to even at 97% and other Cross-Border volume at 79% of 2019 levels. Turning to page 5, switched transactions grew 41% year-over-year in Q2 and we're at 127% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remain strong and card present growth continued to improve aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration across every region. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Let's turn page 6 for highlights on the QR of the revenue line items again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 31% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 36%, while worldwide GDV growth was up 33%, the 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing and mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 60% while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as cross-border volumes ex intra-Europe grew faster than intra-Europe volumes this quarter, partially offset by the lapping of elevated levels of return activity a year ago. Transaction processing fees were up 33% while switched transactions were up 41%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily driven by the lapping of elevated return activity a year ago and adverse mix. Other revenues were up 32%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber and Intelligence and Data and Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 49%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving on to be page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 28%, including the impact from acquisitions. The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, increased spending on advertising and marketing, and increased data processing costs Turning now to page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020 in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to once again present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So, if you look at the spending levels and the percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, the broad-based recovery continued through the second quarter and into July. Specifically, in the first three weeks of July, switched volume spend levels are at 130% of 2019 levels, which is an 9 ppt improvement over Q1. We have seen further recovery in card-present spending with improvements in travel-related categories, including lodging and restaurants. Of note in the U.S., we are seeing consumer airline spent improve significantly since the early part of Q2 with the volumes now back to pre-pandemic levels. Present switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trend we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 show an improving travel trend. Cross border travel, which includes both card-present and travel related card-not-present volumes increased from 39% to 66% of 2019 levels from April to July, primarily driven by strength in Europe and between the U.S. and Latin America. Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. Cross border card-not-present ex travel continues to grow at a healthy rate above pre-pandemic levels, this has moderated recently relative to 2019 levels in part due to a reduced contribution from the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the lapping of significant e-com promotional activity in 2019. Turning now to page 9, I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and [indiscernible] solution to grow with the new and renewed deals we continue to sign. Domestic spending levels are showing healthy growth and we are well positioned for return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. Further, our service lines continue to grow at a healthy rate. Turning to the third quarter. If spending levels to continue to improve along the current trajectory, we would expect Q3 net revenues to grow at the high end of mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, Q2 2020 marked the low point of the pandemic from a spending standpoint with some recovery in the following quarter. So, we will be facing a more difficult bump of approximately 3 ppt in the third quarter. It is also important to point out and this is just one potential scenario as the level uncertainty remains related to new COVID variants and the progress of vaccinations. And, therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue our disciplined approach to expense management, while advancing our strategic objectives in key areas, such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B, and our material solutions, including related brand and product marketing investments. For Q3, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of mid-teens rate versus the year ago on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are lapping the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic developed. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have closed on the transaction with Ekata earlier than expected and expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in both Q3 and Q4 as we integrate several acquisitions in promising new growth areas, such as open banking, digital identity, and real-time payments. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions all the year in which they close and the subsequent year after which time we do not split them out. Other items to keep in mind, foreign exchange is expected to be a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 1 to 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q3. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter within the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business, an improvement over previous expectation due to some discrete tax benefits realized in Q2. One last point, I wanted to let you know that we are planning an Investment Community Meeting for the fall in New York. We are planning a hybrid event on November 10th and we look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Sachin. Crystal, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for all the details as usual. Just want to - just going through, Sachin, some of the numbers you gave and just want to get your updated thinking here on operating leverage in the second half of the year, including the digestion of deals, looks like there is some, but I'm just curious how aggressive some of the spending will be on the integrations given that there's a lot going on, lot of good things going on there with some of the acquisitions that you\u2019ve done and the focus on services if that makes sense?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. So Tien-Tsin, it's like I said in my comments, I think what we have line of sight on is the acquisitions, which we have done, which we have announced and that's why I've given you some level of guidance on as it relates to what contribution they're going to have from a revenue standpoint and an expense standpoint, all of which I just went through in my prepared remarks. Look, the reality is we're running the business for the long-term. We're trying to drive long-term revenue growth and at the same time long-term bottom line growth, and I will do this in a disciplined manner. We have demonstrated over the period of the pandemic that we have sufficient flexibility in our expense base to actually make sure that we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, and at the same time, keep an eye on how we are seeing the top line come around. So, I guess, my point to you is the following, which is we will continue to what's right for the business to drive long-term growth by investing in key strategic areas, both organic and inorganic and that's kind of where we are. In terms of the specifics on the numbers, it's what I just shared with you. We expect that acquisitions will contribute between 2 and 3 points to revenue in the third and the fourth quarter and between 9 and 10 points of expense growth in the third and the fourth quarter.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Just something to add, Tien-Tsin, here is, if you look at the three big acquisitions that have come in over the last year or so, Nets, the largest one we have done, giving us a real advantage in real-time payments around the world. You have the Finicity open banking, now that's a trend that's very hot. We feel really good about that one. And then digital identity, Ekata is foundational to everything that we do online. So very critical acquisitions to Sachin's point. We have to do what is right. But one thing is not changing that is, that's very clearly that our discipline on execution, we stick to our 24 months non-diluted measure on all of these. So, I just want to put that out there with you as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang: All fair point and those are all important areas. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Michael, last week you announced the card offerings to crypto companies, which simplifies crypto conversion to fiat and this fits within and the other announcements you\u2019ve made in crypto. Take the step back. Can you talk about the value proposition Mastercard is bringing to the table for crypto companies, central banks or CBDC, stablecoins providers and the different ways they are either engaging there? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question, very important topic is obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said, there\u2019s broadly three different categories that are in play here, which is central bank digital currencies and then there is private sector stablecoins and there is a floating cryptos. So, we told you that we want to be playing a role across all of them. We also said in the first quarter call that as far as stablecoins are concerned, we are getting ready to technologically enable our network to carry these stablecoins as settlement currency, provided they meet one of our - all three of our criteria, which is regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and stability. So, none of that has changed. Let me just give you a view on what has happened since we had that conversation. So, on the Central Bank digital currency front, things are definitely continuing to move forward. We see a lot of central banks engaged on the topic. The ECB has just recently announced that they will actually move forward with the digital euro after a period of industry consultation. Bank of England is in this period of industry engagement at this point right now, so there is clear progress. What is our value proposition to central banks and governments in this space is first of all, we bring a unique perspective to the market as - to these players as a multi-rail provider because all these countries have to make the trade-off what is my existing financial system delivering my existing financial infrastructure and what else is the central bank digital currency solving for, everybody has different motivations ranging from financial inclusion to cross-border payments and hence we're are sought after partly because we have experience in all of that. I think a particularly critical proposition here is our virtual testing platform because all of these design choices the governments have to make and that we consult them on, we then have to live in the wild so to say. They\u2019ve got to work with the existing financial infrastructure and that's what our virtual test platform does for them. So that's the proposition at this stage for central banks. On the private sector stablecoins, nothing much different, other than up engaging with private sector players as well as regulators on what does good policy look like around private sector stablecoins because this question about regulatory compliance is still unresolved and regulators do need to weigh-in and we're a part of that dialog. On falling cryptos here, the point of currency stability is not solved. So, we won't be enabling that as settlement currency on our network, but clearly people want to invest in that and want to sell their investments and we're going to make this as easy as possible, so we have all these partnerships out there. Now, here's the thing with our announcement last week and that is coin digital currency wallets out there oftentimes prefer to stay in crypto as these transactions are made selling and buying of investments. And here's where our partnerships, for example, with Paxos come in. It is our partner that allows the digital wallet to stay in crypto as they settle with Paxos and Paxos settles with us in fiat. That's an interim step for us as and when we reach to a point that we might be enabling stablecoins on our network itself. So that's kind of where we are, playing a role across the board. This is relevant technology. As a multi-rail player, we got to be in this space, because people are looking for answers.\nHarshita Rawat: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning. Good stuff. Thanks for taking my question. I have one question on B2B payments. Michael, in your prepared remarks, you called out progress on Mastercard Track and Bill Pay Exchange. Taking a step back, can you just give us a sense right now of where you are in terms of scale and trajectory holistically in the digitization of B2B, especially as it seems like some of that digitization has gotten a bit of a jump-start to the pandemic, anything you can dimensionalize around volumes growth rates, et cetera? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Thanks, Lisa. B2B, a huge, huge space, obviously. TAM of $125 trillion, so how we're going about it? One bite at a time, I would say. So the first thing I should say is our commercial business. It is there, it's coming back, commercial travel is coming back as I noted earlier in my comments. So, here the focus is on small business, virtual card. And in the B2B space, specifically virtual card solutions, for example, on online travel agencies. So all that is continuing, but it's worth noting. We give you a number sometime back and then 2020, this was 11% of our GDV and that is what we're happy about that. Now, when it comes to B2B, very specifically, has multifaceted approach, I talk you through earlier across Bill Pay, Track and the whole list that I talked about. Here, I see that if I take Bill Pay today if you look at the fact that we have a quarter of all bills being paid addressable and a third of the biller, so that gives us real scale. So, I think we have come to a point of scalability here with the right kinds of players. Last quarter, we added to Verizon as a biller to the mix. So, that is encouraging. We haven't given specific numbers and we haven't done in this quarter yet, but I really see that is going the right direction and with Nets coming in. We have a significant footprint in Europe. They run a scale Bill Pay business over there. So when the time is right, we'll share some numbers around that. Now, at B2B specifically Track, the excitement around a large bank like Barclays joining the Track ecosystem is great. We fine-tuned our go-to-market with ERP and software providers. So the rollout here is progressing well with both sides, buy-end supplier and buy-end supplier agents. Again, we haven't given numbers yet, but it would be what you would expect when you build it at 2-sided network. We're starting to have players on both sides we could start to connect the corridors. So, the value proposition of Track. At data switch, a payment optimization engine and the choice in multi-rail payments is really starting to get hold. We said you a couple of times, this is going to be a multi-rail journey. COVID, while there was a realization that B2B supply chains have been affected by COVID and there is a desire to digitize, it wasn't exactly top of mind through COVID. So, we're starting to see this interest coming back. So, that's kind of where we are. Sachin, you have anything to add.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, sure. I'd just make one more point which is, as we think about B2B, we also think about it from a segment growth, right. What is the micro kind of business environment, small business environment, mid-market, and then large corporate and when you actually dissect along those lines, you will see that there is a significant amount of spend which takes place across the micro and small business space? And if you further break that down, you will see that there is a significant amount of that spend which takes place in cash. So the only point I'm kind of trying to make is that the value prop of the card rail in B2B still stands and stands pretty strong to displace cash, much like it has in the consumer space and is a tremendous opportunity for digitalization to continue down that path there as well. So, I know, we talked a lot about unstable flow and I think that's super important, but we certainly internally are not losing sight of the fact that the significant amount of cash spend which still takes place where the value prop of stands good.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, lot of checks, awesome. Terrific color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions for you. One, any thoughts on the reopening of the Durbin Amendment discussion. And second, are you planning to update your three year guide at the Investor Day later this year. And I know you just announced it, but figured I'd ask anyway. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Okay. So, let me take the last one which comes like a bit of a cheeky response. I think you will just have to tune in Craig to find out if we going to get 3-year guidance or longer term guidance at the time. On interchange, so complex topic for sure and the new administration is looking at various regulatory and lawmaking initiatives as we all know we've just seen news yesterday. Now from the outset, we've learned in with the new administration to build a really positive relationship. So that is very good and we're continuing obviously the same kind of interaction and engagement on the topic as important as interchange to our industry with lawmakers on the Hill House, Senate on both sides of the aisle. We're monitoring this very closely. There is chatter here and there on interchange, it is a topic that's always been focused by different parties. What I would say is we've had the benefit of now having many years of playing seeing these interchange regulation on debit play out as an enough data us for us out there to say that really what it was intended to do, we can't really see it. Cost for consumers have gone up and benefits have been reduced. We keep providing that data to lawmakers and other interested parties and say, here's what I want the facts are stating. Now, when it comes to interchange regulation by the credit, you would expect the same in terms of cost impact and in terms of benefits impact, but there is another aspect here and that is the access to credit. You should assume that the access to credit for middle-class Americans is going to be impacted and not in permanent way if this interchange regulation comes in and so it is all something that needs to be thought through very carefully. What are the puts and takes? Why does this makes sense and that's the dialog we're leaning in, it's a good thing as we things play out in many other markets around the world and have some experience with that and cannot bring to the table as well. So, that's kind of where we are closely monitoring\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, a lot of eyes on cross-border travel spending and there were some constructive data points this quarter. Maybe two interrelated questions understanding the Delta variant adds complexity to our view, but do you think that we continued to see progress on travel spending going forward. And I think Sachin, you mentioned in your third quarter view, you expect continued spending trends. Is there a view on cross-border as well?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Hey, Sanjay. I am sure why don't I go ahead and take that question. So really I will purposefully think the following, which is again the uncertainty in the environment prevails given all these variants, which have been showing up, but the reality is the following, which is, it has been clearly demonstrated that people want to travel and they do so when they're able to travel and that's been showing in the domestic environment and that's been now shown in the cross-border environment. So, one of the things, which is something which we very closely track is how is it that booking levels are taking place, what's kind of trajectory of spend looking like or trajectory of kind of data looking like and then which are the corridors which are opening up based on, for example, earlier this week, there was a dialog around on the UK being opened up the vaccinated people coming from the U.S. and from other countries. So, the reality is the following, which is the data has been seen, it is what we shared with you through the first three weeks in July. We are positive in terms of our sentiment as we progress through the second half of the year that as people get more vaccinated. More corridors will open up and as more borders open up, people will exercise their ability to travel because they have the intent to travel and this is really, really important because as I look at what's going on across the globe, you can see that the U.S., Latin America, which has the ability to travel with the borders being open, people are exercising that and they are showing [indiscernible] that come through. Similarly, now we're hearing about Canada opening up, which will be again something, which is encouraging from our perspective in terms of how we will play that out. If, on the other hand, is still I would say pretty kind of subdued level just because of the reality of the situation in Asia being what it is with the variance now actually getting to higher levels in certain country in Asia. So, hard to predict. But longer term, I guess, what I kind of look through all of this, but we feel encouraged about is that the vibrancy of travel is something, which will come back and most importantly, we are very well positioned to capitalize on that as and when it does come back.\nWarren Kneeshaw: I just want to add one point as I listen to Sachin what I find very noteworthy here is back to the comment about like 35 countries have now over 50% of vaccinations level. So, this kind of sequence of you are vaccinated and you are willing to travel, which we have both seen as proof points and then governments finding ways now to enable these corridors as what we've seen in Canada and the UK. There is a full stock of people who are vaccinated and want to travel and until you come to the point of who else is not vaccinated. There is a long runway for us for this to play out, but as Sachin said very difficult to predict at this point, but those are facts that are on the table that we are looking at and we've seen it over the last three weeks.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. We're now a year-and-quarter basically into the pandemic, Michael, when we think about the structural and sustainable elements of what we're seeing in volume and even some of the other aspects of your revenue, like some of the value added service that you've really been growing well probably better than I think we would have expected pre-pandemic. Can you give us a sense now if you revisited that what you see as now sustainably elevated, structurally better that could persist over the next few years beyond just stimulus and pent-up demand?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time going to level out. I think you're right, Once you've caught up time and met everybody again and what we're going to come to the back of that, but there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly on commercial traffic. We'll see how that would play out. You know it's interesting when you look over the last 2 quarters, we see continued elevated levels of digital e-commerce spend, but we see in store coming back. So there is not a net zero game going on. I think this is actually really generally secular trend against cash that is going to continue to run for a very long time. So, it's good to have these two legs to stand on from our business model. I think that will remain, you will see some of the e-commerce going to reduce over time, but I don't think we will go back to the levels that we had before the pandemic because people who would have learned better experiences and they would like to continue with that. I think every bit of consumer research that we do tells us that and, by the way, this is not just for online shopping, it is for digital banking and for contactless. it's for everything across the board and generally between 60% and 70% of people that we ask and so we ask them every month say exactly that. With this push towards a more digital world, more data that needs to be kept safe, so I could I see that the path for our cyber-security solutions is a very clear and a very good one and we will not see of eversion to something there before because you have the elevated driver of more digital just out there driving that business and the same for data and analytics. Data analytics, again, more data people want to understand it back to what is Sachin talking about small business. Here's a bunch of players that have traditionally maybe not used tools like that. Understanding and managing their business through data and analytics, but now they can, so there is a whole new segment that is opening up that we will, would like to serve through our partners in terms of real insights and how you run the business online from whatever you might have been doing in the brick and mortar space before. So, I think those are structural changes that are here to last. Cross border I don't think there's going to be something dramatically structural changing. That's really the cross border e-commerce. I think that is, that's again -- some people would have figured out that this does actually work. It couldn't go anywhere they were using cross border e-commerce platforms and tools and I think that will continue. One more thing that comes to mind structurally is the heightened and elevated interest of governments in electronic payments and digital payments that has started last year, again that was driven by the prices initially, how do I get my stimulus payment out to now a conversation why this is an interesting space and I founded my infrastructure is stated, I need to partner with people, so that is something that I see fundamentally as an opportunity, but it's important to engage with governments as you know as a fair partner and see that local footprints and things like that do matter that is we are well positioned with our multi-rail infrastructure to [indiscernible]. So, the few things that come to mind, in fact, lead us earlier question on B2B. I think is continued interest in digitizing B2B supply chain and therefore B2B payments that will also play out and grow over time over the next 2, 3 years.\nDarrin Peller: That's really helpful. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you so much. I was very interested in the Stripe partnership and in some of the other partnerships. Can you may be shed some more light on what we doing with Stripe. It sounds very differentiated. Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Dan how long -- the joint partnership. As you heard me say, this is really across the board, a true strategic partnership. So, this is enabling their customer set with basically every payment tool that is available and providing choice, that's in the end what this is about. Verizon entirely different strategic partnerships. but here's a here's another network, but a 5G network. We said what could we do. In fact, we talked about SME in this call in a couple of occasions now. Think about an SME that today has a card terminal and how they're going to compete with the marketplace. If you imagine for a moment you have a full Internet connectivity with not much infrastructure that you need to bring in and then you can provide a true omnichannel experience even the smallest business can do that. That is what, 5G can deliver at any endpoint anywhere in any situation and that is the vision that the Verizon and his team and our folks that we have developed. This is very specific. We've been on it for a while and we're expecting to make a real difference there. So, two different types of strategic partnerships. I think they both matter. Come back to the point that it's for us providing choice and payments to anyone out there that is transacting in payments.\nDan Dolev: Yes. That is done.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, good morning. I know we talked about cross-border travel just thinking about cross-border card-not-present ex travel. I know that drop of touch in June and then the month-to-date July. Just wondering what the outlook might be, should we see further lower growth numbers there as we had into further through the year as we think about maybe more in-store activity, tougher comps, less e-com promotional activity. Just trying to get a pulse on that number as we go forward. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Brian. So, couple of things going to point out on that line item really at the end of the day that are things which are I can call episodic which took place in the months of April and June and there is volatility in the price of crypto. There is more purchases which took place there as the price came down, then you had the inverse effect of that taking place. So, the reality is that to us is kind of one of those things which will remain volatile and I say that only because I don't know when the price is going to go and how people are going to exercise their choice to purchase crypto on a going forward basis. What I will tell you is we've seen a decent level of deceleration takes place and how people utilizing Mastercard products to purchase these digital currencies like crypto over the last 3 weeks, as reflected in the numbers. So that's kind of one of the factors, which includes that. The second thing is [indiscernible]; where the timing of the e-com promotional activity took place in 2019 happened to be in the first few weeks of July. So that angle will give us something which is on a going forward basis going to be impacting what the super index growth rate is for this line item 2021 versus 2019. Suffice it to say the following, which is the trend towards digital continues. It's true and domestic, it's true and cross border and the fact that that is a positive tailwind back to what Michael just talked about in terms of structural changes, something we are well positioned to actually keep participating in as you know as economies evolve and things start looking up in different parts of the globe. So that's what I'd like to share with you on that one.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the call.\nSachin Mehra: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I am just ask a follow-up on cross-border. In the second quarter, the cross border volume growth ex intra-Europe was a really good proxy for your overall cross-border revenue growth. So, I mean just hypothetically if July month-to-date trends hold for these volumes for the rest of Q3, it would seem like cross-border revenue growth could approach 60% this quarter. So I just wanted to see if that's a fair characterization or if there's any other moving parts we should be aware of. And then, if you can just give us some quick comments on Q3, Q4 rebates; that would be great. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So on cross-border, Jason, I mentioned to you that that you're aware about the fact that intra-Europe cross border is low yielding than all other cross border. I think that's one thing to keep in mind because growth rates across those populations will spend will determine what revenue growth rate ultimately looks like. The reality in the second quarter we had a couple come from an elevated level of returns that we had seen and last year, which had the impact of subduing our cross-border volume key growth rate, some in this second quarter. And again, it's not like those returns are elevated and returns only took place in the second quarter of last year as the pandemic hit people started making cancellations in terms of their airline bookings, their hotel bookings and that's kind of while it tapered, It's still a going into the third quarter as well. So, it's something to keep in mind as to what the puts and takes are when you're thinking about growth rates. On rebates and incentives, here's what I'd tell you, I think you're very well aware about the focus of the Company on making sure we are setting ourselves up to continue to win market and winning market share. It comes through creating fantastic value proposition and then delivering them at great value to our customers, which is whether rebates and incentives come into play. So, we continue to do that and we will continue to do a new deals which will have an impact on rebates and incentives. The one to one piece of information I'll share with you is that as it relates to Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be January generally in line with what we saw in Q2. That's the extent of what I'm going to share with you in terms of where I kind of see [indiscernible] incentives playing out. Obviously, the mix of volume as well [ph].\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate taking the question. Michael, lots of progress on risk fraud ID etc. It sounds like services generally are pretty important growth driver. I wonder if you could compare and contrast what Mastercard is doing versus some of the sort of purpose of risk and fraud products in the market, different channels, different capabilities, kind of how you coexist and compete with, with some of those independent providers looking up like a risk applied [ph].\nMichael Miebach: Right. Thanks, Andrew. Great, great question. So, if you look at our services portfolio to start with we try to seek an entry point as the sweet spot leveraging our footprint in payments and our data and then have the technological capabilities and the talent and all of that coming together to a differentiated proposition. So, you're ready see us compete with other services player on a pure play and that has nothing to do with our position and payments. So that's the starting point of our strategy and we are looking for adjacencies that just leverage our core competencies. Now, when it comes to the cyber-solutions If I think about a product like decision intelligence, which basically helps our customers to make decide what's a good decision and what is not a good decision, It is exactly at the sweet spot of everything that I said. I had the transaction data, the availability to having them in real-time in our system available and then using state-of-the-art AI to make the decisions for our customers. So, here I think we have from a competitive landscape perspective, a real leg up versus pure plays. Similar in loyalty, we are one of the largest loyalty players in the world, They are few plays, but the fact that we see all the transaction flow and we can look at aggregated anonymized data of look-alikes and what they are interested in and how their preferences go in terms of rewards, offers, mileage programs and so forth, again, puts us in a differentiated proposition. You see us building out our proposition in Cyber and coming back to that. Looking at the whole value chain, decision intelligence about the transaction before the transaction. What we're now doing is the foundational element. So here we go in; [indiscernible] is in itself having a set of data that allows us in real-time to help a customer one of our customers decide if this account opening requests is a good one or bad one, that is very high confidence store. That customer is obviously interested in working with us on the downstream through the whole value chain of the transaction and other Cyber Security solutions automated fulfillment where you again say is that address actually a real address or is somebody that is just ordering something in somebody else's name. So, that's how we're thinking about it holistically and leveraging our footprint in payments.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Crystal. I think we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good morning, Andrew kind of stole my lead question there, but also question on open banking. I think it has been suggested that is performing, the Finicity is performing better than expected. So hoping to maybe get a little bit more color on what's working better than expected and the longer-term open banking strategy for Mastercard?\nMichael Miebach: Bob, great point. Open banking, it's important trend. What we really like is this whole concept of putting power into the hand of the individual using their own data to get a better choice and services, the financial services, they're not [indiscernible] eventually, so we like that. We've been active in Europe for 3 years now, two years now. We went live in summer 2019 over there, good momentum. You heard us talk about Tesco and Lloyds in the UK, set of use cases that are now live so happy about that. Good for print over there and then here at Finicity that was a real kick for us closing that transaction in November last year. And the Finicity team, first of all your team in permission API there, they are the inventors of the FDX standard so they live and breathe open banking and that is really critical for us as a player here in the U.S.; great incumbent in the market. Now, what is going better than expectations, I see a lot of momentum and engaging with banks they have best-in-class data connections and they had a best footprint in banks because now that and everybody else is looking at that and said let's disconnect with Finicity but we also see progress on the Fintech side because this is an ecosystem that works on both sides. So we are excited about that. They had an interesting set of solutions today that account verification, credit decisioning system and now with the mortgage verification service, we're starting to build out at the same time of a driving on the deal front. And we're also expanding the product set by bringing our data together with their data and our tech talent with tech talent, so on every dimension really on, around Finicity, we are quite happy.\nBob Napoli: Great, thank you. Appreciate it.\nWarren Kneeshaw: All right, good. I think that brings us to the end of our time. I gave you a summary of the quarter just earlier on, so I am not going to repeat that again. Just wanted to thank you for all your support all throughout and looking forward to speaking to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much, and goodbye.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Now turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on currency neutral to basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investment. Net revenue was up 31%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy, strong recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 28%, including an 8 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 34% and net income was up 36%, both of which include a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 37% year-over-year to $1.95, which includes $0.03 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions, offset by a $0.02 contribution on share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.7 million worth of stock and an additional $398 million through July 26, 2021. So, now let's turn to page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 33% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing strength in debit and credit. U.S. GDV increased by 34% with debit growth of 23% and credit growth of 50%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 32% with debit growth of 39% and credit growth of 25%. Gross dollar volume about 58% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes up 48% and other Cross-border volumes up 71%, reflecting continued improvement and the lapping of the debts of the pandemic last year. In the second quarter, Cross-Border volume was 87% of 2019 levels with intra-Europe almost back to even at 97% and other Cross-Border volume at 79% of 2019 levels. Turning to page 5, switched transactions grew 41% year-over-year in Q2 and we're at 127% of 2019 levels. Card-not-present growth rates remain strong and card present growth continued to improve aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration across every region. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued. Let's turn page 6 for highlights on the QR of the revenue line items again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 31% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 36%, while worldwide GDV growth was up 33%, the 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing and mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 60% while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as cross-border volumes ex intra-Europe grew faster than intra-Europe volumes this quarter, partially offset by the lapping of elevated levels of return activity a year ago. Transaction processing fees were up 33% while switched transactions were up 41%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily driven by the lapping of elevated return activity a year ago and adverse mix. Other revenues were up 32%, including a 9 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber and Intelligence and Data and Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 49%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving on to be page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral basis, total operating expenses increased 28%, including the impact from acquisitions. The remaining growth in operating expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we invest in our strategic initiatives, increased spending on advertising and marketing, and increased data processing costs Turning now to page 8, let's discuss the specific metrics for the first 3 weeks of July. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020 in part due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began last year. To provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to once again present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts, when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So, if you look at the spending levels and the percentage of 2019 for switched volumes, the broad-based recovery continued through the second quarter and into July. Specifically, in the first three weeks of July, switched volume spend levels are at 130% of 2019 levels, which is an 9 ppt improvement over Q1. We have seen further recovery in card-present spending with improvements in travel-related categories, including lodging and restaurants. Of note in the U.S., we are seeing consumer airline spent improve significantly since the early part of Q2 with the volumes now back to pre-pandemic levels. Present switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trend we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 show an improving travel trend. Cross border travel, which includes both card-present and travel related card-not-present volumes increased from 39% to 66% of 2019 levels from April to July, primarily driven by strength in Europe and between the U.S. and Latin America. Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. Cross border card-not-present ex travel continues to grow at a healthy rate above pre-pandemic levels, this has moderated recently relative to 2019 levels in part due to a reduced contribution from the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the lapping of significant e-com promotional activity in 2019. Turning now to page 9, I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and [indiscernible] solution to grow with the new and renewed deals we continue to sign. Domestic spending levels are showing healthy growth and we are well positioned for return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios. Further, our service lines continue to grow at a healthy rate. Turning to the third quarter. If spending levels to continue to improve along the current trajectory, we would expect Q3 net revenues to grow at the high end of mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, Q2 2020 marked the low point of the pandemic from a spending standpoint with some recovery in the following quarter. So, we will be facing a more difficult bump of approximately 3 ppt in the third quarter. It is also important to point out and this is just one potential scenario as the level uncertainty remains related to new COVID variants and the progress of vaccinations. And, therefore, the pace of recovery may not be linear. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue our disciplined approach to expense management, while advancing our strategic objectives in key areas, such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B, and our material solutions, including related brand and product marketing investments. For Q3, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of mid-teens rate versus the year ago on a currency neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are lapping the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic developed. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have closed on the transaction with Ekata earlier than expected and expect acquisitions will contribute about 2 to 3 ppt to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately 9 to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in both Q3 and Q4 as we integrate several acquisitions in promising new growth areas, such as open banking, digital identity, and real-time payments. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions all the year in which they close and the subsequent year after which time we do not split them out. Other items to keep in mind, foreign exchange is expected to be a 0 to 1 ppt tailwind to net revenues and a 1 to 2 ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q3. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter within the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect the tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business, an improvement over previous expectation due to some discrete tax benefits realized in Q2. One last point, I wanted to let you know that we are planning an Investment Community Meeting for the fall in New York. We are planning a hybrid event on November 10th and we look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Yes. So Tien-Tsin, it's like I said in my comments, I think what we have line of sight on is the acquisitions, which we have done, which we have announced and that's why I've given you some level of guidance on as it relates to what contribution they're going to have from a revenue standpoint and an expense standpoint, all of which I just went through in my prepared remarks. Look, the reality is we're running the business for the long-term. We're trying to drive long-term revenue growth and at the same time long-term bottom line growth, and I will do this in a disciplined manner. We have demonstrated over the period of the pandemic that we have sufficient flexibility in our expense base to actually make sure that we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, and at the same time, keep an eye on how we are seeing the top line come around. So, I guess, my point to you is the following, which is we will continue to what's right for the business to drive long-term growth by investing in key strategic areas, both organic and inorganic and that's kind of where we are. In terms of the specifics on the numbers, it's what I just shared with you. We expect that acquisitions will contribute between 2 and 3 points to revenue in the third and the fourth quarter and between 9 and 10 points of expense growth in the third and the fourth quarter. Yes, sure. I'd just make one more point which is, as we think about B2B, we also think about it from a segment growth, right. What is the micro kind of business environment, small business environment, mid-market, and then large corporate and when you actually dissect along those lines, you will see that there is a significant amount of spend which takes place across the micro and small business space? And if you further break that down, you will see that there is a significant amount of that spend which takes place in cash. So the only point I'm kind of trying to make is that the value prop of the card rail in B2B still stands and stands pretty strong to displace cash, much like it has in the consumer space and is a tremendous opportunity for digitalization to continue down that path there as well. So, I know, we talked a lot about unstable flow and I think that's super important, but we certainly internally are not losing sight of the fact that the significant amount of cash spend which still takes place where the value prop of stands good. Okay. So, let me take the last one which comes like a bit of a cheeky response. I think you will just have to tune in Craig to find out if we going to get 3-year guidance or longer term guidance at the time. On interchange, so complex topic for sure and the new administration is looking at various regulatory and lawmaking initiatives as we all know we've just seen news yesterday. Now from the outset, we've learned in with the new administration to build a really positive relationship. So that is very good and we're continuing obviously the same kind of interaction and engagement on the topic as important as interchange to our industry with lawmakers on the Hill House, Senate on both sides of the aisle. We're monitoring this very closely. There is chatter here and there on interchange, it is a topic that's always been focused by different parties. What I would say is we've had the benefit of now having many years of playing seeing these interchange regulation on debit play out as an enough data us for us out there to say that really what it was intended to do, we can't really see it. Cost for consumers have gone up and benefits have been reduced. We keep providing that data to lawmakers and other interested parties and say, here's what I want the facts are stating. Now, when it comes to interchange regulation by the credit, you would expect the same in terms of cost impact and in terms of benefits impact, but there is another aspect here and that is the access to credit. You should assume that the access to credit for middle-class Americans is going to be impacted and not in permanent way if this interchange regulation comes in and so it is all something that needs to be thought through very carefully. What are the puts and takes? Why does this makes sense and that's the dialog we're leaning in, it's a good thing as we things play out in many other markets around the world and have some experience with that and cannot bring to the table as well. So, that's kind of where we are closely monitoring Yes. Hey, Sanjay. I am sure why don't I go ahead and take that question. So really I will purposefully think the following, which is again the uncertainty in the environment prevails given all these variants, which have been showing up, but the reality is the following, which is, it has been clearly demonstrated that people want to travel and they do so when they're able to travel and that's been showing in the domestic environment and that's been now shown in the cross-border environment. So, one of the things, which is something which we very closely track is how is it that booking levels are taking place, what's kind of trajectory of spend looking like or trajectory of kind of data looking like and then which are the corridors which are opening up based on, for example, earlier this week, there was a dialog around on the UK being opened up the vaccinated people coming from the U.S. and from other countries. So, the reality is the following, which is the data has been seen, it is what we shared with you through the first three weeks in July. We are positive in terms of our sentiment as we progress through the second half of the year that as people get more vaccinated. More corridors will open up and as more borders open up, people will exercise their ability to travel because they have the intent to travel and this is really, really important because as I look at what's going on across the globe, you can see that the U.S., Latin America, which has the ability to travel with the borders being open, people are exercising that and they are showing [indiscernible] that come through. Similarly, now we're hearing about Canada opening up, which will be again something, which is encouraging from our perspective in terms of how we will play that out. If, on the other hand, is still I would say pretty kind of subdued level just because of the reality of the situation in Asia being what it is with the variance now actually getting to higher levels in certain country in Asia. So, hard to predict. But longer term, I guess, what I kind of look through all of this, but we feel encouraged about is that the vibrancy of travel is something, which will come back and most importantly, we are very well positioned to capitalize on that as and when it does come back. Hey, Brian. So, couple of things going to point out on that line item really at the end of the day that are things which are I can call episodic which took place in the months of April and June and there is volatility in the price of crypto. There is more purchases which took place there as the price came down, then you had the inverse effect of that taking place. So, the reality is that to us is kind of one of those things which will remain volatile and I say that only because I don't know when the price is going to go and how people are going to exercise their choice to purchase crypto on a going forward basis. What I will tell you is we've seen a decent level of deceleration takes place and how people utilizing Mastercard products to purchase these digital currencies like crypto over the last 3 weeks, as reflected in the numbers. So that's kind of one of the factors, which includes that. The second thing is [indiscernible]; where the timing of the e-com promotional activity took place in 2019 happened to be in the first few weeks of July. So that angle will give us something which is on a going forward basis going to be impacting what the super index growth rate is for this line item 2021 versus 2019. Suffice it to say the following, which is the trend towards digital continues. It's true and domestic, it's true and cross border and the fact that that is a positive tailwind back to what Michael just talked about in terms of structural changes, something we are well positioned to actually keep participating in as you know as economies evolve and things start looking up in different parts of the globe. So that's what I'd like to share with you on that one. Sure. Sure. So on cross-border, Jason, I mentioned to you that that you're aware about the fact that intra-Europe cross border is low yielding than all other cross border. I think that's one thing to keep in mind because growth rates across those populations will spend will determine what revenue growth rate ultimately looks like. The reality in the second quarter we had a couple come from an elevated level of returns that we had seen and last year, which had the impact of subduing our cross-border volume key growth rate, some in this second quarter. And again, it's not like those returns are elevated and returns only took place in the second quarter of last year as the pandemic hit people started making cancellations in terms of their airline bookings, their hotel bookings and that's kind of while it tapered, It's still a going into the third quarter as well. So, it's something to keep in mind as to what the puts and takes are when you're thinking about growth rates. On rebates and incentives, here's what I'd tell you, I think you're very well aware about the focus of the Company on making sure we are setting ourselves up to continue to win market and winning market share. It comes through creating fantastic value proposition and then delivering them at great value to our customers, which is whether rebates and incentives come into play. So, we continue to do that and we will continue to do a new deals which will have an impact on rebates and incentives. The one to one piece of information I'll share with you is that as it relates to Q3, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be January generally in line with what we saw in Q2. That's the extent of what I'm going to share with you in terms of where I kind of see [indiscernible] incentives playing out. Obviously, the mix of volume as well [ph]."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are the highlights of the quarter. The strong momentum we started the year with accelerated this quarter, with net revenue up 31% and EPS up 37% versus a year ago, all that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. On that same basis, quarter two net revenues are now 10% over 2019 levels, even though international travel is in the early stages of recovery, which is showing the strength of our diversified revenue streams. Domestic switched volumes are well above pre-pandemic levels with all regions growing at a healthy rate. We are seeing improvements in both domestic and cross-border travel with significant upside potential. Within this context. we're making progress against our strategic objectives and have expanded our relationships with key partners like Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Stripe, and Verizon. Let's dive in. Looking first at the broader economy, domestic spending levels continue to show improved in-store sales and strength in e-commerce. According to our quarter two SpendingPulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales ex auto, ex gas were up 14% versus a year ago and up 10% versus 2019, reflecting improved consumer mobility and some residual effects of fiscal stimulus. SpendingPulse also indicated that overall European retail sales in quarter two were up 13% versus a year ago and 6% versus 2019. The vaccine rollout has scaled in the U.S., UK, and Germany and several other countries with over 35 countries now reporting that over 50% of their populations are at least partially vaccinated. Broadening this effort is critical and will of course take time. Turning to our business, specifically in the four-phased framework we established for managing through the COVID environment, we believe that most markets are at a growth phase domestically as cross-border spend is now starting to normalize, the border restrictions are being relaxed. Looking at Mastercard spending trends. Switched volumes continue to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across all products. Debit spend remains elevated and we are seeing further recovery in credit, driven in part by the return of travel and increased discretionary spending. This recovery led by consumer credit, but it's important to note that commercial credit is also improving and has now reached pre-pandemic levels as well. In terms of how people are spending, they are definitely getting out more as we are seeing improvement in card-present spending, particularly in the travel, retail, and restaurant categories, while e-commerce continues to be strong. Now turning to cross-border. Cross-border card-not-present spending, excluding online travel spend, continues to be very strong. On the travel front itself, it is clear people want to travel and they do so where and when able to. We've seen domestically and across borders where there are limited restrictions. For example, we're seeing strength between the U.S. and Latin America as well as an increase in travel within Europe. Our industry reports, there has been a recent increase in bookings for travel between the U.S. and Europe and the quarantine requirements for entry into Canada are starting to be relaxed so that's a further opportunity. Overall, we expect more borders to open in the second half of the year depending, of course, on infection rates, including the recent variants and progress on the vaccination front. Against this improving backdrop, we are focusing on our strategic priorities: one, rolling out core products supported by our services; second, driving digital enablement both in-store and online; third, ensuring the ecosystem is safe and secure; and fourth, providing choice through our multi-rail capabilities. As always, we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long-term by continuing to manage our expenses carefully. Let's look at them one by one. First off, we're driving growth in our core products and the leveraging our comprehensive services to do so, working with new and existing customers to solve their pain points both in payments and beyond. We're well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel, and remain focused on building on our strength in this area by expanding relationships with our travel partners. For example, we have renewed our exclusive co-brand with JetBlue Airlines in the U.S. We also entered into a long-term global partnership with Cathay Pacific and Asia Miles, who will migrate their existing co-brand portfolio to Mastercard. In the Middle East, we have expanded our British Airways co-brand; and in Latin America, we are now the preferred brand for LATAM Airlines. It is important to note that our services played a critical role in enabling all these deals, including our data analytics, Test & Learn, loyalty, consulting, and cybersecurity solutions. Of course, we also continue to drive growth in the core outside of travel. Here are a few examples. We are excited about our partnership with Citi to launch the new Citi Custom Cash Mastercard, offering card members cashback in the top eligible spend category. JPMorgan Chase, we've extended and deepened our agreement in the commercial space and we have renewed our Master brand relationship with Chase in the U.S. We also continue to partner closely with community banks throughout the U.S., including a flip of First Southern National Bank's debit portfolio to become their exclusive network brand. On the digital front, we're well positioned to drive the acceleration of the secular shift with our digital capabilities no matter how consumers want to shop in store, online, or both. As consumers return to in-person shopping, adoption of contactless continues to grow. In the second quarter, contactless penetration represented 45% of in-person purchase transactions globally according to our switched transactions, that's up from 37% a year ago. At the same time, e-commerce continues its strong growth and we are providing consumers choice on how they want to pay online. For example, Click to Pay, which improves the guest checkout experience, is now rolled out in over 10 markets and we continue to launch a significant new merchants, such as the Canadian Tire Group. On to the Buy Now Pay Later space in Australia, we are partnering with Citi and Commonwealth Bank of Australia to offer instalments to consumers wherever Mastercard is accepted and whether in store or online we are securing and streamlining the consumer experience through our tokenization services. Tokenized transactions across in store, online, and in-app surpassed 1 billion per month throughout the second quarter. We continue to partner with major digital players to expand the reach of our digital capabilities. For example, we just entered a strategic partnership with Stripe to give business a small control over how they spend their money by enabling Stripe users to create, manage, and distribute virtual and physical cards for small business, commercial and consumer across credit, debit, and prepaid. We also entered a partnership with Verizon to bring 5G innovation to the global payments industry. Leveraging our services and insights and pairing Mastercard solution with Verizon's 5G connectivity will allow us to create better experiences from the checkout lines being built, even to how businesses are run. The increased capacity and reduced latency of 5G will enable us to take another step towards making every device a commerce device. Now, on to securing the ecosystem. As more merchants and consumer shift to digital, the importance of keeping the ecosystem safe and secure is paramount and is creating a strong demand for our cyber-solutions. In addition to organic growth, the number of our acquisitions in the space continue to perform well. For example, Ethoca had strong deal momentum, including a fraud and dispute management agreement with EBANK, a payment solution provider operating across 15 countries in Latin America. RiskRecon, which monitors and accesses customers' third-party cybersecurity risk is now scanning millions of companies globally up from thousands when we acquired them at the end of 2019.  NuData is providing biometric fraud prevention tools to Major League Baseball and we very happy to advance our digital identity capabilities with the acquisition of Ekata that is now closed and off to a strong start on the deal front. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to our initiatives focused on addressing a broader set of payment tools with our multi-rail capabilities. The key here is to provide choice. Essentially, the right tool for the job. There are multi-rail approach, including our expertise and capabilities in cards, real-time payments, and support for digital currencies, we are able to deploy the right combination of assets to meet our customers' needs. And more than just having this range of capabilities, we're making these solutions work together seamlessly. Let me give you a few examples. In B2B, we're making progress with Mastercard Track, building out our global open-loop network by working with buyer agents and supplier agents, such as banks, software companies, and ERP vendors. On the bank side, we're very excited to have signed Barclaycard payments. So we'll use track to connect their global business customers on both the buyer and the supplier side ecosystem across multiple rails. You can also find FreshBooks, a premier accounting software platform with customers in over 100 countries. In the Bill Pay space, we continue to scale the Mastercard's Bill Pay Exchange, which leverages our real-time payment capabilities to provide a transformative mobile first experience to bill payments with Citi Treasury and Trade solutions now connecting into the platform. The Mastercard Send continued to penetrate a variety of new payment flows beyond traditional card payments, this enabled dozens of use cases and hundreds of programs across every region of the world. For example, we are partnering with innovative digital messaging platforms to offer P2P services to consumers. Today use of WhatsApp in Brazil and transfer money directly in app leveraging Mastercard's Send. We're also partnering with MoneyGram and Checkout enable near real-time cross border P2P transfers across Europe. And on the B2C front, we continue to support the fast-growing Gig economy and then partnering with Payfare to enable instant earnings payouts, some of the largest Gig platform in the U.S.. Through open banking, Mastercard is empowering people and businesses across the globe to easily and securely gain access to their financial data to create new opportunities for themselves. In the U.S., our efforts with Finicity are running ahead of expectations as we continue to enhance direct API connectivity for banks and fintechs. For example, we're partnering with Jack Henry to enable consumers to bank at more than 400 community financial institutions to use its digital platform to access use and benefit from their own financial data. Navy Federal Credit Union recently signed direct data access agreements with Finicity. Finicity is also leveraging data connections to launch new products and new verticals, such as its mortgage verification service. And finally, in terms of crypto currency; we're making it easier for cryptocurrency wallets to connect seamlessly to our network through pilot Paxos, Circle and Evolve Bank & Trust, which simplifies the conversion of crypto into fiat. Secondly, we're partnering with ConsenSys, the Ethereum software engineering firm to accelerate the development of crypto applications and services for all our customers. Now, summing all of this up, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, benefiting from our revenue diversification efforts. We believe that most markets are on a growth phase domestically and there is upside potential in cross-border travel. We're winning significant new deals and we continue to focus on our strategic priorities to drive growth over the long term. Sachin, over to you. Yes. Just something to add, Tien-Tsin, here is, if you look at the three big acquisitions that have come in over the last year or so, Nets, the largest one we have done, giving us a real advantage in real-time payments around the world. You have the Finicity open banking, now that's a trend that's very hot. We feel really good about that one. And then digital identity, Ekata is foundational to everything that we do online. So very critical acquisitions to Sachin's point. We have to do what is right. But one thing is not changing that is, that's very clearly that our discipline on execution, we stick to our 24 months non-diluted measure on all of these. So, I just want to put that out there with you as well. Right. Thanks, Harshita. Great question, very important topic is obviously a vibrant space around digital currencies. Let me go back to what we discussed in the previous call, where we said, there's broadly three different categories that are in play here, which is central bank digital currencies and then there is private sector stablecoins and there is a floating cryptos. So, we told you that we want to be playing a role across all of them. We also said in the first quarter call that as far as stablecoins are concerned, we are getting ready to technologically enable our network to carry these stablecoins as settlement currency, provided they meet one of our - all three of our criteria, which is regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and stability. So, none of that has changed. Let me just give you a view on what has happened since we had that conversation. So, on the Central Bank digital currency front, things are definitely continuing to move forward. We see a lot of central banks engaged on the topic. The ECB has just recently announced that they will actually move forward with the digital euro after a period of industry consultation. Bank of England is in this period of industry engagement at this point right now, so there is clear progress. What is our value proposition to central banks and governments in this space is first of all, we bring a unique perspective to the market as - to these players as a multi-rail provider because all these countries have to make the trade-off what is my existing financial system delivering my existing financial infrastructure and what else is the central bank digital currency solving for, everybody has different motivations ranging from financial inclusion to cross-border payments and hence we're are sought after partly because we have experience in all of that. I think a particularly critical proposition here is our virtual testing platform because all of these design choices the governments have to make and that we consult them on, we then have to live in the wild so to say. They've got to work with the existing financial infrastructure and that's what our virtual test platform does for them. So that's the proposition at this stage for central banks. On the private sector stablecoins, nothing much different, other than up engaging with private sector players as well as regulators on what does good policy look like around private sector stablecoins because this question about regulatory compliance is still unresolved and regulators do need to weigh-in and we're a part of that dialog. On falling cryptos here, the point of currency stability is not solved. So, we won't be enabling that as settlement currency on our network, but clearly people want to invest in that and want to sell their investments and we're going to make this as easy as possible, so we have all these partnerships out there. Now, here's the thing with our announcement last week and that is coin digital currency wallets out there oftentimes prefer to stay in crypto as these transactions are made selling and buying of investments. And here's where our partnerships, for example, with Paxos come in. It is our partner that allows the digital wallet to stay in crypto as they settle with Paxos and Paxos settles with us in fiat. That's an interim step for us as and when we reach to a point that we might be enabling stablecoins on our network itself. So that's kind of where we are, playing a role across the board. This is relevant technology. As a multi-rail player, we got to be in this space, because people are looking for answers. All right. Thanks, Lisa. B2B, a huge, huge space, obviously. TAM of $125 trillion, so how we're going about it? One bite at a time, I would say. So the first thing I should say is our commercial business. It is there, it's coming back, commercial travel is coming back as I noted earlier in my comments. So, here the focus is on small business, virtual card. And in the B2B space, specifically virtual card solutions, for example, on online travel agencies. So all that is continuing, but it's worth noting. We give you a number sometime back and then 2020, this was 11% of our GDV and that is what we're happy about that. Now, when it comes to B2B, very specifically, has multifaceted approach, I talk you through earlier across Bill Pay, Track and the whole list that I talked about. Here, I see that if I take Bill Pay today if you look at the fact that we have a quarter of all bills being paid addressable and a third of the biller, so that gives us real scale. So, I think we have come to a point of scalability here with the right kinds of players. Last quarter, we added to Verizon as a biller to the mix. So, that is encouraging. We haven't given specific numbers and we haven't done in this quarter yet, but I really see that is going the right direction and with Nets coming in. We have a significant footprint in Europe. They run a scale Bill Pay business over there. So when the time is right, we'll share some numbers around that. Now, at B2B specifically Track, the excitement around a large bank like Barclays joining the Track ecosystem is great. We fine-tuned our go-to-market with ERP and software providers. So the rollout here is progressing well with both sides, buy-end supplier and buy-end supplier agents. Again, we haven't given numbers yet, but it would be what you would expect when you build it at 2-sided network. We're starting to have players on both sides we could start to connect the corridors. So, the value proposition of Track. At data switch, a payment optimization engine and the choice in multi-rail payments is really starting to get hold. We said you a couple of times, this is going to be a multi-rail journey. COVID, while there was a realization that B2B supply chains have been affected by COVID and there is a desire to digitize, it wasn't exactly top of mind through COVID. So, we're starting to see this interest coming back. So, that's kind of where we are. Sachin, you have anything to add. Yes. So Darrin, the pent-up demand at some point in time going to level out. I think you're right, Once you've caught up time and met everybody again and what we're going to come to the back of that, but there's still some more pent-up demand to go, particularly on commercial traffic. We'll see how that would play out. You know it's interesting when you look over the last 2 quarters, we see continued elevated levels of digital e-commerce spend, but we see in store coming back. So there is not a net zero game going on. I think this is actually really generally secular trend against cash that is going to continue to run for a very long time. So, it's good to have these two legs to stand on from our business model. I think that will remain, you will see some of the e-commerce going to reduce over time, but I don't think we will go back to the levels that we had before the pandemic because people who would have learned better experiences and they would like to continue with that. I think every bit of consumer research that we do tells us that and, by the way, this is not just for online shopping, it is for digital banking and for contactless. it's for everything across the board and generally between 60% and 70% of people that we ask and so we ask them every month say exactly that. With this push towards a more digital world, more data that needs to be kept safe, so I could I see that the path for our cyber-security solutions is a very clear and a very good one and we will not see of eversion to something there before because you have the elevated driver of more digital just out there driving that business and the same for data and analytics. Data analytics, again, more data people want to understand it back to what is Sachin talking about small business. Here's a bunch of players that have traditionally maybe not used tools like that. Understanding and managing their business through data and analytics, but now they can, so there is a whole new segment that is opening up that we will, would like to serve through our partners in terms of real insights and how you run the business online from whatever you might have been doing in the brick and mortar space before. So, I think those are structural changes that are here to last. Cross border I don't think there's going to be something dramatically structural changing. That's really the cross border e-commerce. I think that is, that's again -- some people would have figured out that this does actually work. It couldn't go anywhere they were using cross border e-commerce platforms and tools and I think that will continue. One more thing that comes to mind structurally is the heightened and elevated interest of governments in electronic payments and digital payments that has started last year, again that was driven by the prices initially, how do I get my stimulus payment out to now a conversation why this is an interesting space and I founded my infrastructure is stated, I need to partner with people, so that is something that I see fundamentally as an opportunity, but it's important to engage with governments as you know as a fair partner and see that local footprints and things like that do matter that is we are well positioned with our multi-rail infrastructure to [indiscernible]. So, the few things that come to mind, in fact, lead us earlier question on B2B. I think is continued interest in digitizing B2B supply chain and therefore B2B payments that will also play out and grow over time over the next 2, 3 years. Yes. Dan how long -- the joint partnership. As you heard me say, this is really across the board, a true strategic partnership. So, this is enabling their customer set with basically every payment tool that is available and providing choice, that's in the end what this is about. Verizon entirely different strategic partnerships. but here's a here's another network, but a 5G network. We said what could we do. In fact, we talked about SME in this call in a couple of occasions now. Think about an SME that today has a card terminal and how they're going to compete with the marketplace. If you imagine for a moment you have a full Internet connectivity with not much infrastructure that you need to bring in and then you can provide a true omnichannel experience even the smallest business can do that. That is what, 5G can deliver at any endpoint anywhere in any situation and that is the vision that the Verizon and his team and our folks that we have developed. This is very specific. We've been on it for a while and we're expecting to make a real difference there. So, two different types of strategic partnerships. I think they both matter. Come back to the point that it's for us providing choice and payments to anyone out there that is transacting in payments. Right. Thanks, Andrew. Great, great question. So, if you look at our services portfolio to start with we try to seek an entry point as the sweet spot leveraging our footprint in payments and our data and then have the technological capabilities and the talent and all of that coming together to a differentiated proposition. So, you're ready see us compete with other services player on a pure play and that has nothing to do with our position and payments. So that's the starting point of our strategy and we are looking for adjacencies that just leverage our core competencies. Now, when it comes to the cyber-solutions If I think about a product like decision intelligence, which basically helps our customers to make decide what's a good decision and what is not a good decision, It is exactly at the sweet spot of everything that I said. I had the transaction data, the availability to having them in real-time in our system available and then using state-of-the-art AI to make the decisions for our customers. So, here I think we have from a competitive landscape perspective, a real leg up versus pure plays. Similar in loyalty, we are one of the largest loyalty players in the world, They are few plays, but the fact that we see all the transaction flow and we can look at aggregated anonymized data of look-alikes and what they are interested in and how their preferences go in terms of rewards, offers, mileage programs and so forth, again, puts us in a differentiated proposition. You see us building out our proposition in Cyber and coming back to that. Looking at the whole value chain, decision intelligence about the transaction before the transaction. What we're now doing is the foundational element. So here we go in; [indiscernible] is in itself having a set of data that allows us in real-time to help a customer one of our customers decide if this account opening requests is a good one or bad one, that is very high confidence store. That customer is obviously interested in working with us on the downstream through the whole value chain of the transaction and other Cyber Security solutions automated fulfillment where you again say is that address actually a real address or is somebody that is just ordering something in somebody else's name. So, that's how we're thinking about it holistically and leveraging our footprint in payments. Bob, great point. Open banking, it's important trend. What we really like is this whole concept of putting power into the hand of the individual using their own data to get a better choice and services, the financial services, they're not [indiscernible] eventually, so we like that. We've been active in Europe for 3 years now, two years now. We went live in summer 2019 over there, good momentum. You heard us talk about Tesco and Lloyds in the UK, set of use cases that are now live so happy about that. Good for print over there and then here at Finicity that was a real kick for us closing that transaction in November last year. And the Finicity team, first of all your team in permission API there, they are the inventors of the FDX standard so they live and breathe open banking and that is really critical for us as a player here in the U.S.; great incumbent in the market. Now, what is going better than expectations, I see a lot of momentum and engaging with banks they have best-in-class data connections and they had a best footprint in banks because now that and everybody else is looking at that and said let's disconnect with Finicity but we also see progress on the Fintech side because this is an ecosystem that works on both sides. So we are excited about that. They had an interesting set of solutions today that account verification, credit decisioning system and now with the mortgage verification service, we're starting to build out at the same time of a driving on the deal front. And we're also expanding the product set by bringing our data together with their data and our tech talent with tech talent, so on every dimension really on, around Finicity, we are quite happy. Thank you."

With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer Mike Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are the headlines. We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre-pandemic trends. We continue to execute against our strategic objectives as we signed notable new deals, advanced our multi-rail strategy by closing our transaction with Nets and extended our digital identity capabilities with the planned acquisition of Ekata. So let's dive in looking at the broader economy first. Domestic spending levels showed continued improvement with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our quarter one spending pulse report, which is based on all tender types, U.S. retail sales were up 11.8% versus a year ago ex-auto ex-gas. This reflects the impact of fiscal stimulus and the lapping of the start of the pandemic. Spending costs also indicated that overall European retail sales got close to flat in quarter one versus a year ago. The vaccine rollout has become scaled in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries. And broadening this critical effort is underway, but will take time. Let's start with our business specifically and the four phases framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. At this time last year, markets were going through the containment and stabilization phases. We now believe many markets are transitioning from the normalization phase to the growth phase domestically. Cross-border travel spending continues to be in the stabilization phase where spending is restricted due to closed borders. Looking at Mastercard spending trends, volumes continued to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across products. We saw particular strength in debit, primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and share gains. In terms of how people are spending e-commerce continues to be strong and we're seeing improvements in card-present spending. On the travel front, we've seen some recent improvements in domestic travel, primarily personal travel. Cross-border travel remains limited as border restrictions remain in place for most markets. Cross-border card-not-present spending excluding online travel spend continues to hold up well. As we have observed in many markets progress is not always linear. And we believe there's significant pent-up demand for travel as we've just seen in domestic travel. We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs. International travel should start to open on a select basis in the second half of the year between countries, the strong vaccination programs and/or low case rates. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel engaging travelers early through our loyalty programs and expanding relationships with our partners in travel. As a result we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. As we look forward and see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top-line growth, we will increase the investment we put toward our strategic priorities; one, growing our share of payments; two, deploying a broader set of services; three, enabling digital solutions; and four, providing choice with multi-rail capabilities. As always we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long-term along with expense discipline. Let me illustrate how we're executing against each of these strategic priorities. I will begin by sharing how we're driving growth in the core, always supported by differentiated services capabilities. Here are a few key examples. Building on our strength in U.S. retail co-brands, we're excited that Mastercard was chosen as the exclusive network for Gap Inc.'s co-branded credit cards across the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. This partnership will include a re-imagined rewards program to drive increased customer engagements with the migration of existing card members planned for 2022. We've had a long-term services relationship with Gap, which led to additional opportunities to support both their co-brand programs and their broader business.  We're also leveraging our differentiated service to expand relationships with key global partners like Santander. This quarter we signed a new deal with Santander Brazil and executed a long-term exclusive partnership with Superdigital Santanders fintech arm to provide digital prepaid accounts across seven Latin American markets. Also, we're happy to announce that the financial arm of one of the largest retailers in Europe, El Corte Ingles is migrating its entire closed-loop consumer credit portfolio to Mastercard exclusively for 10 years. This strategic partnership includes our processing capabilities and will contribute to growing Mastercard's overall credit share in the region.  Talking about share, I'd also like to point out that the migration of Santander UK debit portfolio is progressing well and we're preparing for the other conversions to be previously announced.  Finally, we secured several strategic renewals and expansions. As many of you know, Huntington Bank announced its anticipated acquisition of TCF at the end of last year, which will make them a top 10 US regional bank. I'm happy that they have decided to both renew their existing business with us and convert the TCF business to Mastercard. This brings significant new debit volume to our brands. We've also expanded our relationship with Synchrony Bank as the exclusive partner for their general purpose consumer credit portfolio.  Turning to the next strategic priority. We continue to enable digital solutions to drive the secular shift to electronic payments. A great example of this can be seen through the partnerships we have established with several leading mobile telecom providers across Africa and other regions.  In Africa, there are more mobile money accounts than bank accounts and consumers increasingly expect digital financial services to be provided through their mobile phones. Now we signed a multi-year partnership with the MTN group to enable millions of their MTN mobile money wallet customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution.  We've also expanded our partnership with the Airtel group to equip their Airtel money customers with virtual cards and QR solutions. And we've extended our partnership with the Airtel Payments Bank in India along with the recent investment in Airtel Mobile Commerce. While our digital capabilities are enabling us to penetrate new geographies, our multi-rail strategy is allowing us to provide greater choice and capture new payment flows.  We're happy that we have now completed the acquisition of the majority of the Corporate Services division of Nets, which reinforces our leadership position in providing real-time payments infrastructure and applications. This transaction significantly enhances our application capabilities inclusive of a robust set of bill payment solutions which are operating at scale across several markets.  Furthermore, this is an integral component of our regional strategy in Europe enabling us to operate as a local partner. We see significant opportunity to expand these capabilities into additional markets around the world.  Speaking of Bill Pay in the US, we continue to scale our Bill Pay Exchange solution through new billers and bank partners. We're excited to announce that Verizon will connect as the most recent national biller on the platform. Turning to cross-border applications. We have now fully integrated our acquisition of Transfast and can now provide unsurpassed reach via a single point of access that allows banks and digital partners to send and receive money through bank accounts, mobile wallets, cards and cash payouts to over 90% of the world's population in more than 100 countries.  We're expanding our relationships with the United Nations Federal Credit Union, Saudi British Bank to expand their reach into additional markets. And both Bancorp and IDT payment services will now leverage our capabilities for cross-border advantages. And in addition, we have extended our partnership with Western Union who will be using our capabilities to allow customers in 18 European countries to transfer funds directly to debit cards in near real time. Our multi-rail capabilities are critically important to our efforts in open banking as well. They enable us to provide our customers across banks and fintechs with greater flexibility in how they manage both payment and data flows. We're off to a strong start at Finicity as we've integrated our sales teams and already signed several new connectivity partners and application users. For example, we're live with our state-of-the-art API-based data access in several large banks including US Bank as well as with the leading payroll processor representing millions of employees. Finicity was also selected by companies like Upgrade, SWBC, MoCaFi, MoneyLion and TomoCredit to provide permission-based access to financial data to support a variety of use cases including mortgage, lending and of course, payments. We're expanding our open banking capabilities in Europe as well as we're now live with our Open Banking Connect solution with Lloyds Bank in the UK for consumers to make payments to their credit cards. We continue to see a great deal of interest and activity in digital currencies and we're innovating in this space through new crypto and CBDC partnerships enabling digital currencies on our network and continuing our investments and underlying blockchain technology as part of our multi-rail strategy. We have several new crypto partnerships approved for launch this quarter including a partnership with Gemini, a leading crypto platform here in the US to launch a first of its kind cryptocurrency rewards credit card that allows consumers to receive crypto rewards on everyday purchases. And over in Spain, Crypton, a crypto exchange launching a Mastercard Crypto Card. On central bank digital currencies, we continue to engage with central banks around the world and our virtual testing platform is helping them design features similar issuance and evaluate interoperability with existing payment systems. In partnership with the Central Bank of Bahamas and Island Pay, we launched the world's first CBDC-linked payment card, enabling people to pay for goods and services using fiat currency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Digital identity. Digital identity is critically important as the shift to a digital economy continues. It is a foundational component of our multilayered approach to security, and have allowed us to help consumers and businesses safely and easily prove their identity, while enabling them to main control over their information. Last week, we announced the planned acquisition of Ekata, which advances the digital identity efforts we have underway. Ekata has access to validated identity information on a global basis and leverages artificial intelligence to produce highly accurate identity scores. Ekata's insights support multiple payment and non-payment use cases, including new account openings, instant issuance, and transaction risk checks, to be used by a broad range of customers, including leading digital merchants, financial institutions, travel companies, and digital currency platforms. This is an example of how we are entering into adjacent areas and innovating beyond the core payment transaction. And now back to the bigger picture. We're leveraging our business to have a broader impact on society by executing our commitment to bring one billion people into the digital economy by 2025. Specifically on the environmental front, we have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and issued a sustainability bond in the last quarter to support these efforts. Furthermore, our Mastercard carbon calculator developed in collaboration with Doconomy is enabled on our network to provide consumers, with a snapshot of carbon emissions generated by their purchases. We've worked with customers to issue over 10 million cards using sustainable materials. If we tie all of this together, we are now linking executive comp to Mastercard's sustainability priorities. With all of that in mind, I continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead, and I'm happy with the progress we're making against our objectives. And with that, Sachin over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everybody. So turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items, and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 2%, returning to positive growth for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in Q2 2020 and includes a one ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 7%, which includes a four ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was down 1% and net income was down 6%, both of which include a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 5% year-over-year to $1.74, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $418 million through April 26, 2021. So let's turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing sequential improvement in both debit and credit as vaccination progress takes hold and mobility increases. In addition, debit growth is being further strengthened by fiscal stimulus and share gains. US GDV increased by 14% with debit growth of 26% and a decline in credit of 1%. Outside of the US, volume increased 5% with debit growth of 12% and a decline in credit of 2%. Cross-border volume was down 17% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes down 11% and other cross-border volumes down 23%. Turning to page 5. Switched transactions grew 9% in the first quarter globally. Card-not-present growth rates have accelerated during the past year and continue at those elevated levels, while card-present transactions are now growing above 2019 levels for the first time, since the peak of the pandemic. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are $2.8 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 2% was primarily driven by domestic transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by lower cross-border volume fees and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned acquisitions contributed approximately one ppt to net revenue growth. Looking at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 8% in line with worldwide GDV growth of 8%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 26%, while cross-border volumes decreased 17%. The nine ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix, mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switch transactions were up 9%. The five ppt difference is primarily driven by adverse mix. Other revenues were up 27%, including a three ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 4%. Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 7%. This includes a 2 ppt increase from acquisitions and a three ppt increase related to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. Excluding these items, expenses were flat as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, while keeping an eye on top line growth. Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of April. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, primarily due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began mostly in March of last year. Hence to provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So if you look at the spending levels as a percentage of 2019. For switched volumes, they have shown steady sequential improvement, continuing along the same trend line we saw in Q1. This is driven primarily by the US, which has benefited from the recent fiscal stimulus. We have seen improvements in discretionary categories like clothing, furniture and sporting goods. And we have also seen some recent strength in personal domestic travel in the US and the UK, which we are making strong progress in vaccinations. For instance, we have seen US airline spend essentially doubled over the last four weeks relative to where it was earlier in Q1. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 remained mostly unchanged through the start of April. We continue to see very strong growth in card-not-present cross-border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend. However, border restrictions remain widespread and to cross-border travel, which is card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes continues to be impacted. As you can see from the numbers there's a significant opportunity for improvement in cross-border travel. In fact, where borders are open such as Mexico certain Latin American countries and the UAE, we have seen travel improve. Turning to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and feel we are very well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we have signed over the last several quarters. We have positioned ourselves for the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios and have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a healthy rate and has helped diversify our revenue base. In terms of the macro environment, domestic spending levels have continued to improve entering the growth phase this quarter, supported in part by fiscal stimulus and the rollout of effective vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has been uneven however. And as a result, we expect the pace of recovery to vary from country-to-country. As Michael said, we do believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel and are already seeing domestic travel improve. In terms of cross-border, we believe that in the second half of the year, we will see additional borders open particularly between those countries with low infection rates and/or advanced vaccination programs. Turning to the second quarter. If spending levels continue on their current trajectory, we would expect Q2 net revenues to grow around a low to mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. It is important to point out that this is just one potential scenario, which could be impacted by factors, such as more restrictive measures being put in place because of rising infections or the opening or closing of borders. In terms of operating expenses, we continue our disciplined expense management approach, while furthering our strategic imperatives and keeping an eye on top line growth. As we progress through the growth phase of the pandemic domestically, we will look to increase our investments in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our multi-rail solutions, as well as begin to increase our advertising and marketing-related spend. For Q2, we expect operating expenses to grow at a rate in the low 20s versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are now beginning to lap the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic hit. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have announced the planned acquisition of Ekata and have now closed on the transaction with Nets, and expect acquisitions will contribute about two to three ppt to revenue in Q2 and for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately nine to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in the second quarter and eight to nine ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year after which time we do not split them up. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a two to three ppt tailwind to net revenues and a three to four ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q2. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rate environment. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Sachin. Denise, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Michael, can you elaborate on Ekata acquisition and your broader digital identity efforts? Digital identity has so many problems today streaming for solutions and is something you've been looking at for quite a while. So, can this be a long-term adjacency for your business? And how does it fit in with what you're doing with open banking at Finicity? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Hi Harshita, thanks for the question. So, we're excited about Ekata. And it is a continuation of what we have been doing in digital identity. So, clearly it's a non-sustainable path forward in a more digital economy to have even more passwords, so that's pretty clear. So, identify is one pillar in our overall security strategy. So, we needed to strengthen up here. The -- we started that activity with a pilot that we launched in Australia about a year ago that is now going live in partnership with the Australian telecom Optus where we are introducing a reusable digital identity. What Ekata does is it accelerates our efforts and accelerates our efforts because Ekata has access to verifiable data points that allow to establish an identity. As I said earlier, they can in near real-time produce very accurate identity scores. And it comes along with a set of -- established set of global customers, digital merchants, cryptocurrency chains, financial institutions, and so forth. So, we were on the track. Ekata is accelerating our efforts. It sits right into our existing set of cyber solutions. It's at the start of the transaction. It's at the end of the transaction. And in between, we have our decision intelligence our various other transaction-focused solutions. So, it's a full package. It sets us apart. And as you can appreciate you linked this back to open banking as you asked the question, we are going beyond the payment transaction and such. And you need identity solutions for data transaction just as much as you do for digital identity use cases.\nHarshita Rawat: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes, two quick ones for me. First off just anything you can tell us in terms of second quarter expectations on rebates whether it's relative to last quarter or last year? I know you had given us a little bit of help on that for the first quarter. So, I'd love to hear your thoughts on Q2. And then just wondering if we can get a quick comment on OpEx. I mean I know that on an organic constant currency basis the second quarter OpEx is growing about in line with net revenue. So, is that kind of the right general model to think about in the second half as well if the recovery progresses in line with your base case or does the second quarter have more catch-up OpEx spend in it? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks Jason. So, let me take your rebates and incentives question first. Look I mean rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially as domestic spending recovers and new and renewed deals come online. I think you're aware about the fact that our domestic volumes are more indexed -- our rebates and incentives are more indexed to domestic volumes. There are less indexed to cross-border. So, depending on how that volume mix plays out things might move around. But generally speaking, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up from current levels pretty much the remainder of the year as volumes recover. On your second question around OpEx, look as we look forward, we see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our topline growth and we will increase the investment we put forward towards our strategic priorities. And these are essentially the ones we've talked about growing our share of core payments, ensuring that digital experience for our customers, driving a broader set of services capabilities, executing on our digital strategy, as well as our B2B strategy. As we do this, we will keep an eye on both the topline as well as the bottom-line. And we will basically be very focused on making sure that we are making investments to drive the long-term growth of our business. And that's kind of the essential thing I'd like to leave you with which is we will continue to stay disciplined from an expense management standpoint. We see domestic spending is transitioning towards the growth phase which gives us confidence and vaccines are effective and they're being deployed at scale. So, we will keep an eye on all of those metrics, we will keep an eye on the topline and we will look to invest in the business to drive that long-term growth objective that we're talking about.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your Next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys. When we look at the structural improvements that are impacting the business coming out of the pandemic, it does look like you have what could be several hundred basis points of incremental earnings power long-term from all the variables you guys talked about and [Indiscernible] including your investments. Do you also think though -- so first of all, I guess if you can comment on that in terms of what are the most of the areas you're most excited about in terms of incrementally having changed now more spending in certain areas than maybe pre-pandemic. But would you also comment on whether your spend -- the investment levels you're at now on a percentage of revenue basis or on an overall dollar amount is something we can see some more operating leverage off of if we get that uplift from better structural terms. Thanks guys.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Darrin let me start off with the structural changes. I mean, that's the key question here. What makes a trend? What will stick? We have over the last 14 months on a monthly basis helped consumers around the world, small businesses around the world. And the input that we're getting from this research remains unchanged. And that is fundamentally starting with increasing consumer confidence, spending is going up. And then when you look at the way how people spend, what we're hearing is, when the pandemic subsides, 70% of people are saying, I'm going to continue to use more online commerce than I have before the pandemic. Almost 70% is saying the same thing for digital -- for digital banking. Almost the same number says more for contactless. And then you look at the other side of the coin and that is about 60% of people are saying, I will actually use less cash. So we believe that these trends of elevated -- anything elevated online will prevail, maybe not at the same levels, but they will be elevated. At the same time, we're already seeing that in countries where strong vaccination programs are there and social distancing measures are reduced, that the spend in store is coming back. So people do want to go and spend at the local restaurant or support the local shop in their local main street. So, the good thing is, we're ready for both with our solutions. So that is around consumer behavior, the changing consumer as we turn out of this nightmare. And then, you look at what else is going on. And what else are we seeing is with this push towards a more digital economy we're seeing there's more data around. And the thirst for data analytics is increasing. Our services teams can't be running fast enough to satisfy that thirst. If you look at more data, you look at an increasing cyber footprint. So our cyber solutions that is going to be -- it's going to be a continuing trend. Earlier we talked a little bit about our multi-rail strategy and what we're doing there. I talked about Europe and being the local partner. Government is interested in -- payments government is interested in real-time payments and crypto central bank digital currency. So this whole trend of government leaning in, I think is important. So our focus on our government vertical is going to help us there. And finally, just came across the news over the last couple of days is the dependence on international supply chains is showing up. It shows up in the context of vaccine distributions lately, but it has been showing up across many different industries. So, there is a real push to digitize supply chains, make them more flexible. And of course that comes to payments as well and comes to associated data flows. So B2B should also be seeing quite a push out of -- as we turn out of the pandemic. So, it's a shifting picture. And Darrin, I agree with you that there's a lot of things to feel positive about in terms of our strategy is on point for all these drivers. That's why we're increasing the investment behind these. And the second half of the question, I'll turn over to Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: So Darrin, just the one thing I'd kind of point out to you is and you can see this in the slide deck which we shared with you. You can see, how let's take something like cross-border and cross-borders card-not-present excluding travel, right? That as been indexed back to 2019 is showing pretty healthy growth rates. Now, as we come out of the pandemic, we expect a large part of that to stick. On the flip side, when you look what cross-border, travel-related indexation looks like in other words 2021, current spend levels relative to 2019 they're running at about 40%. So if you believe that travel comes back and we do believe that travel comes back, we see structurally the opportunity for upside growth coming from that as well. Just kind of bringing the whole picture together just to add to what Michael was saying. And kind of lends directly into your operating leverage question as well.\nDarrin Peller: Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on crypto specifically related to stablecoins and CBDC. Michael, you called out in the prepared remarks that many governments are using Mastercard's virtual testing platform for their CBDC experiments. Can you describe just, what you're seeing in terms of if governments are looking at implementing stablecoins or CBDCs, what type of public-private partnerships are they considering? Meaning, what type of role or roles could you envision Mastercard playing? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Lisa, it's a great question. Let's take a look at CBDCs. I mean, across the whole crypto space, I mean where we want to play a role in CBDCs, we want to play a role in private stablecoins, we want to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets. So, it's a broader space. Specifically in CBDCs, I would describe it as relatively early days. So the engagement that we have and that's where we see our role to start with is to answer the question that you just asked in partnership with governments is what is the right construct? What is the role of the private sector? And where we came out and fortunately, as of late there's been a few thought leadership pieces involving, some of the leading central banks around the world including the ECB and the Bank of England and so forth is ideally there's a two-tier system, where the government takes the role of mining the currency so to say, as they do in fiat and the private sector takes the role of distributing it. And the private sector this comes to your question about the specific role that players could have including us is innovating around that. Innovating the true power of blockchain, what else could it do other than facilitating a payment. So I think there is \u2013 there's a direction that we like, where this is going. So concepts of interoperability are also very important because the utility for a consumer or business will only come when you can do something with the central bank digital currency. I think this example out of Bahamas is actually a very striking one. So here is a Mastercard partner program that allows you to spend on a CBDC unit that you have received at any place Mastercard is accepted. That's solving the last mile issue. Imagine how we could be doing this in so many countries. So is that engagement on model? Is that engagement on policy? Now as you try to do something like the Bahamas did, you've got to test it and try it. And for now that we see our second role in actually facilitating a real-life test bed, where you can iterate around the design and see how does this work. And that's not only for governments. Governments like that Sandbox, they engage, but it's also to pull in the commercial banks because it needs to go in conjunction if you have a two-tier system. So I see all of that and then I'll come to assume a scenario where this is in play and it exists in a given country. We just talked about the Bahamas. There's this last mile issue. But there's also been the questions of what other applications can ride on this infrastructure. And you've heard us talk about in the context of real-time payments, our go-to-market is always underlying infrastructure, application services and we intend to do the same thing here. And that is, what is an application that could ride on top of this? It could be a smart trade contract. So a smart contract technology is what we're investing in when I made the reference earlier reinvesting in further blockchain technology. And then of course there are services. Everybody right now is asking us, what should our blockchain strategy and our advisors team is all over that. And there will be cyber questions. Governments are raising the question when a blockchain comes along, is that a backdoor for hackers? So our whole cyber solution space is also geared up to engage. So I think there's a role to play for the private sector and there's a role to play very specifically for us to help the private sector and government.\nLisa Ellis: Perfect. Thank you. Very exciting.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nChris Donat: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just trying to get a little more specific on the benefits of vaccines and lower case loads for cross-border travel. As we think about the European union taking steps to allow vaccinated US tourists into Europe, when we think about that corridor of the US Traveling to Europe is that \u2013 I imagine it's big enough to move a needle for cross-border but can you help us understand how meaningful like some key corridors would be if they reopen in strong ways for you, or is it a highly dispersed set of corridors that you've got around the world that will take a lot of them coming back online.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, Chris, I can give you a little bit of color on that. So when you think about first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe. You could see generally speaking intra-Europe constitutes a fairly significant portion of our cross-border volumes. And you can see that from the metrics which we've been sharing with you. And so that will depend upon how travel opens up within the intra-Europe border as kind of point one. Now but we recognize also that intra-Europe is lower-yielding than the other cross-border volume. So and as you think about it you should think about it in that context. Secondly, what I'd tell you is US is an important outbound corridor, there's no question about that. But there are several corridors well beyond that. When I think about the Middle East and Africa, when I think about, what's going on in Asia Pacific, these are all important corridors. Take US to Canada another important corridor. US to Latin America and Mexico, these are all important corridors. I think the operative thing here is, at least what we are spending a lot of time thinking about is not only about the rollout of vaccines but what are governments doing to establish travel bubbles. So you've heard about Australia and New Zealand. You're hearing about Hong Kong, Singapore. You're hearing about China establishing some sort of bubble. So there's a lot of work which is currently underway in terms of seeing, is there a level of comfort to open up borders and to make it less onerous for people to travel. So it's kind of a three-prong thing as far as I'm concerned: it's vaccines; it's the opening up and establishing of border kind of protocol; and then the third is have you made it less onerous for people travel. And you've got to look at all those three, as you think about how cross-border travel comes back. Now, the proof points we've got so far are in corridors like US, Latin America, things have worked out pretty nicely. It's not that onerous. People are traveling. You've seen decent cross-border spend. Similarly in the UAE, you've seen decent cross-border spend. A lot of this \u2013 and one more reminder, a quick one I've got for you is, a lot of our cross-border travel volume is personal travel and we do expect personal travel will come back. And the leading indicator for that is we've seen it come back in the domestic environment pretty robustly. Now that you've taken away these quarantine requirements in the context with the US and several other countries. So that's the kind of color I just wanted to share with you as you think about how this will play out going forward.\nChris Donat: Okay. Thanks very much, Sachin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just thinking about modeling going forward looking at the two year. In particular thinking about the lapping of stimulus versus the economic recovery. Sachin, I don't know if you could give us some help on how you guys thought about the impact of those two factors. And particularly, I'm just curious on how much stimulus had an impact? Do you think it's having an impact? And then secondly on services, I noticed the strength there. Just curious, if that strength is expected to continue as we move forward through this year? Thanks so much.\nMichael Miebach: Modeling was a queue here. This is clearly for Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: So I guess what I'd tell you, I'd tell you our experience based on what we've seen from the stimulus is this round of stimulus has actually come into the flow from a spending standpoint a lot more rapidly than the last round of stimulus had come through. What we've also experienced is that the dollar spent are not kind of once and done. So said differently people are saving. And then there is the trickle effect which comes to over a period of time. So it's our expectation that the impact of the stimulus will continue to be felt, but at a declining pace as time goes along, because we've started to see a lot of that come through in the early part right now. As I kind of just mentioned you can see that in the strength in the numbers we've got. And then on your question on services, solid quarter on services again. Look services continues to do really well. It does well from a revenue-generating capability. It also powers the core very effectively. You can see that in the way we're winning share. And I'm seeing a very strong pipeline in terms of what we're seeing from a services standpoint going forward. So I feel pretty good. And the way again I think about this is you have a set of existing capabilities. How do you deepen your penetration with your customer base, existing and new customers, and then you keep building on your services capabilities. For example, the acquisitions we've recently done and how did we contribute to growth on a going-forward basis. So I think when you add all of that up, I feel pretty good about our services growth trajectory going forward.\nMichael Miebach: I just want to add one point here. So there's the deepening part into our existing customer set. As Sachin just said, you extend your capabilities. There's another vector here and that is extending in new segments. So as we're -- throughout the last couple of years in the front of a number of acquisitions like SessionM or APT we're finding that there's other adjacent segments that are needing these kinds of services. And as we go into these new segments that's also an opportunity for us to also then so to say cross-sell our payment solutions. So it works in different ways. And then the last thing to add obviously when it comes to our multi-rail strategy there's a growth dimension of extending our services across all new flows.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the helps guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask about Nets. Now that you've had it for a couple of months, it was I guess a little different than what you originally agreed to buy. So given that, what are the priorities here Michael both short term and long term? It sounds like Europe is clearly part of it. But can you just catch us up on your to-do items right now?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Yes. So the first thing I would say, it's not entirely different from what we intended to buy. It's certainly different in terms of the expected time line. So it should have been a little faster than it was. Now but that aside, we were excited in August 2019 and we're excited on March 3 when we had Legal Day One and we welcomed the team in Copenhagen. And I'll tell you why we're excited. So with our existing set of multi-rail capabilities, particularly in the account-to-account space we're well positioned with VocaLink. VocaLink has strong infrastructure capabilities, applications and helped us to build the services business. What Nets does is, Nets gives us additional infrastructure capabilities because here's a significantly customizable high-end solution that VocaLink brings which works for large established markets that have had some journey in real-time payments. And then there's Nets which is a more nimble platform that allows us to deal with the smaller markets and take on more in a shorter period of time. So there's complementary assets here and that if you look across that, it makes us the one-stop shop partner, when it comes to real-time payments and that is unsurpassed. There's nothing else out there at this point in time. On the application side, I'm even more excited because here what we're having is -- we're not just getting technological capability with this purchase and we can bolt on to what we've already done in VocaLink. But we're getting scaled businesses that are live in market. There are strong bill payment propositions and volumes with large customer reach in particularly in the Nordics regions, but other parts of Europe as well. So we've identified Bill Pay as a growth opportunity sometime back here in the US and now we're bolting that on. And then we have the choice of taking some of our US capabilities into other parts of the world or do the same with Nets. So that is accelerating our growth in the application space which I'm particularly focused on. I think last, but not least that they have activities in the open banking space and few services around real-time payments. So that just rounds off the picture. And I come back to Legal Day One. We're getting a fantastic team of engineers and experts in this space that is just really rounding off of our capability side. Now the aspect on how this might look different. So Tien-Tsin you made that reference. And I all want to remind us there was a remedy that we had put on the table in kind of negotiations with the EU commission throughout the approval process. And it basically means, we will license the Nets infrastructure technology to a licensee and the licensee was identified as part of the approval process. That allows -- but that is on the infrastructure side not much of an issue because we have other assets to compete and then we can use it ourselves. So we're not excluded here. The package of having infrastructure application and service altogether, I think makes such a differentiated proposition that we were quite happy to give that remedy. It made the EU commission happy. And it comes back to the point about -- yes this is particularly important in Europe because in Europe being seen as a true European partner, we have the commission put a stamp of approval on this transaction and that works well for us. But we're going to take it elsewhere for sure. I mean that's the whole plan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Very complete and clear answer. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Bridging to Tien-Tsin's question, how has the pandemic affected the rollout of account-to-account payments in Europe under PSD2? Account-to-account certainly seems much more akin to debit than credit and we know debit has certainly accelerated. So any thoughts would be appreciated?\nMichael Miebach: Yes Dave that's a great question. Throughout the last quarter calls, we make references to engagements on the government front and oftentimes that involve our progress and our engagement with governments on account-to-account. And there are other things obviously that we had to dial down throughout the pandemic because there simply was no appetite in the market but account-to-account wasn't one of them. We never missed a single step there and neither did government. This was really driven by a lot of governments trying to get stimulus money into their citizens' hands and they couldn't do it fast enough and they couldn't do it in an efficient-enough way. So the focus and the light shed on real-time payment infrastructure was -- certainly helped. So I would see there is an increasing engagement around account-to-account. Throughout the pandemic if you look at what else was going on you saw the 2-factor authentication thing in Europe for -- strong customer authentication I think is the actual technical term there. That moved forward throughout the pandemic. So the government the financial sector players in Europe advanced that and that was broadly it. And then you look at what we've done with open banking. I mentioned it earlier. That's again a regulator-driven aspect of payments and the broader financial services here at Tesco. We talked about that last quarter I think in our Lloyd's. So there is momentum. I think it's actually literally a shot in the arm rather than anything else. Sachin do you have anything to add?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. I'll just make one more additional comment. When we think about account-to-account there's certainly the domestic flows and then there's the account-to-account cross-border. And I think we've got to kind of think about it in the composite because candidly we're seeing some very decent traction take place even in that cross-border space from an account-to-account standpoint. Michael mentioned this in his remarks where he talked about the traction we're having with the integration of Transfast being complete. And it's not only exclusive to Europe by the way. It's pretty much across the globe. So we think about it holistically including the cross-border categories.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks very much. Appreciate your intake.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on yield within domestic assessments where they held in pretty well for most of 2020, but just over the last couple of quarters have been down about 5% or so. And I guess there are a lot of moving pieces with mix shifting around from quarter-to-quarter with the pace of recovery varying by region. But just any color you could give us on maybe where some of the recent weakness might be coming from and really what needs to happen whether that's a recovery in certain geographies or anything else you might not be thinking about to get yields in that segment moving back up. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. So Trevor I think your question specifically is around domestic assessment yields correct? Just want to be sure.\nTrevor Williams: Correct. Yes.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. Look I mean we've seen a little bit of recovery in domestic assessment yields in the first quarter relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter. That number kind of moves around right? And it moves around -- there's a whole bunch of stuff which is kind of going on in there. Because remember in the denominator when you're doing yield calculations we talk about GDV. I think the natural instinct is to think about GDV only as domestic volumes. It's a composition of domestic and cross-border volumes. Whereas the numerator, which is domestic assessments is only the revenue we own on our domestic volumes. So depending on how that mix moves around you're going to see that yield move around as well. And then there are other moving parts in domestic assessments, the card fees and those kind of things which are actually featured in there as well. But by and large I would tell you between the fourth quarter of 2019 going into the first quarter of 2021 our yields have held pretty steady if I take those two endpoints. They bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but they're now pretty steady.\nTrevor Williams: Okay. Sure. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nMichael Miebach: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask about the material debit wins that you've had in Europe and now in the US with TCF. You're going to obviously be on-boarding a significant amount of debit volume over the next two years, which begs the question how do you view the long-term in terms of debit versus credit growth rates? And we've seen insignificant outperformance of debit. During the pandemic it's the obvious replacement for cash. So do you view the spread between the two versus historical levels as widening significantly over time? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Good morning. Craig let me take this and then see if Sachin has anything to add. So throughout the pandemic as you rightly said there was clearly a relative rise in debit over credit transactions. The way I look at this is this is a time of economic uncertainty frankly uncertainty general. And in those times people generally prefer to spend money they have and have more control over that. So that is what we've seen in previous crises so no surprise there that is crisis-induced. We see debit benefit from stimulus payments because they are attached to a bank account. So we saw that. And then you look at how the mix of spending has changed in terms of overweight to everyday spend versus discretionary spend and that is just -- there's a lot of historical consumer behavior ingrained in that is that you use debit for more everyday spend. That is what we're seeing in many markets around the world and that has played out here as well. So now the question is what of that is going to stick back to what we said earlier in terms of trends? And in the end that's hard to predict. I do think what we're going to see is that the crisis in use spend is -- the trigger there is going to go away because this nightmare will be over at some point hopefully soon. And you will also see that the discretionary spend categories are coming back. We're already seeing this in the last three weeks when I look at the first three weeks of April here. So you start to see travel strong travel programs. And it's very I think reasonable to expect that a lot of that is going to drive credit growth back up. So we're going to see a bit of a balancing. Now for us I think the strategy has to be we have to have the best solutions across debit and credit and frankly beyond cards as well because we just talked about earlier how the overall payment landscape is changing. And that's where the focus is. That's why we lean in on the travel side, but that's also why we lean in on debit. And you're right NatWest, Deutsche, Santander it's in conversion right now as I said earlier and that's going to be good for us and we try to bring our best solutions forward with consumers. So Sachin, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. I think Michael you pretty much covered it. The point I'd make Craig in addition is obviously the increased secular shift which is taking place. I think you were alluding to the fact that the first point of replacement of cash happens to be debit. We're certainly seeing that come through. But like Michael said there will be some level of reversion to the mean. The one point I'd make is the way we look at it even from a product life cycle standpoint is people tend to start when you think about financial inclusion and you think about how people come into spending in electronic forms they start with prepaid then move to debit then they start getting their toe into credit. And that's just the natural evolution, which will take place. We want to have a balanced portfolio. We want to win across the board and we want to be ready to actually address those spend as they come across debit and/or credit.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks so much.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Great. Thanks. I see that we've got to the top of the hour. And so maybe I'll just turn it over to Michael to see if you have any final comments as we wrap up.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Thanks, Warren. So, first of all, thanks for your questions. I'd love to go on for a while but be mindful of time. Just the key takeaways bring it all together. It's -- we're back in the growth phase domestically that's fantastic. We're ready for the return of travel. When it comes it's going to be selective second half of the year. We keep strong focus on our strategic priorities. I don't have to repeat them again. We're excited about Nets as I just laid out. And we are excited and hopeful that we will close Ekata as soon as possible. So all that is good. None of this would happen without our people and I do just want to recognize that. It's been 14 months that's a marathon. And our folks are running it hard and that is a big shout out. I sent a note to the whole team this morning with our results and told them that that momentum that we were just sharing with you is really entirely their doing. With that I'm going to leave you to it and look forward to speak to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much and thanks for all your support.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everybody. So turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items, and the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue was up 2%, returning to positive growth for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in Q2 2020 and includes a one ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 7%, which includes a four ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was down 1% and net income was down 6%, both of which include a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was down 5% year-over-year to $1.74, which includes $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions offset by a $0.02 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $418 million through April 26, 2021. So let's turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We are seeing sequential improvement in both debit and credit as vaccination progress takes hold and mobility increases. In addition, debit growth is being further strengthened by fiscal stimulus and share gains. US GDV increased by 14% with debit growth of 26% and a decline in credit of 1%. Outside of the US, volume increased 5% with debit growth of 12% and a decline in credit of 2%. Cross-border volume was down 17% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe volumes down 11% and other cross-border volumes down 23%. Turning to page 5. Switched transactions grew 9% in the first quarter globally. Card-not-present growth rates have accelerated during the past year and continue at those elevated levels, while card-present transactions are now growing above 2019 levels for the first time, since the peak of the pandemic. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are $2.8 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 2% was primarily driven by domestic transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by lower cross-border volume fees and higher rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned acquisitions contributed approximately one ppt to net revenue growth. Looking at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 8% in line with worldwide GDV growth of 8%. Cross-border volume fees decreased 26%, while cross-border volumes decreased 17%. The nine ppt difference is primarily due to an adverse cross-border mix, mainly driven by lower-yielding intra-Europe cross-border volumes being less impacted than higher-yielding other cross border volumes. Transaction processing fees were up 4%, while switch transactions were up 9%. The five ppt difference is primarily driven by adverse mix. Other revenues were up 27%, including a three ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was mostly driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 4%. Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 7%. This includes a 2 ppt increase from acquisitions and a three ppt increase related to the lapping of a favorable hedging gain from a year ago. Excluding these items, expenses were flat as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, while keeping an eye on top line growth. Turning now to Page 8. Let's discuss the specific metrics for the first three weeks of April. We are seeing significant improvements in the growth rates across our operating metrics versus 2020, primarily due to the lapping effects related to the pandemic that began mostly in March of last year. Hence to provide you better visibility into current spending levels, we thought it would be useful to present the 2021 volumes and transactions as a percentage of the 2019 amounts when we were not experiencing the impact of the pandemic. So if you look at the spending levels as a percentage of 2019. For switched volumes, they have shown steady sequential improvement, continuing along the same trend line we saw in Q1. This is driven primarily by the US, which has benefited from the recent fiscal stimulus. We have seen improvements in discretionary categories like clothing, furniture and sporting goods. And we have also seen some recent strength in personal domestic travel in the US and the UK, which we are making strong progress in vaccinations. For instance, we have seen US airline spend essentially doubled over the last four weeks relative to where it was earlier in Q1. Trends in switched transactions remain steady and are generally tracking the trends we are seeing in switched volumes. In terms of cross-border, spending levels as a percentage of 2019 remained mostly unchanged through the start of April. We continue to see very strong growth in card-not-present cross-border volumes, excluding online travel-related spend. However, border restrictions remain widespread and to cross-border travel, which is card-present and travel-related card-not-present volumes continues to be impacted. As you can see from the numbers there's a significant opportunity for improvement in cross-border travel. In fact, where borders are open such as Mexico certain Latin American countries and the UAE, we have seen travel improve. Turning to Page 9. I wanted to share our current thoughts looking forward. First off, we continue to make strong progress against our strategic objectives and feel we are very well positioned to grow with the new and renewed deals we have signed over the last several quarters. We have positioned ourselves for the return of travel with travel-oriented portfolios and have built a strong set of services capabilities, which continue to grow at a healthy rate and has helped diversify our revenue base. In terms of the macro environment, domestic spending levels have continued to improve entering the growth phase this quarter, supported in part by fiscal stimulus and the rollout of effective vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has been uneven however. And as a result, we expect the pace of recovery to vary from country-to-country. As Michael said, we do believe there is significant pent-up demand for travel and are already seeing domestic travel improve. In terms of cross-border, we believe that in the second half of the year, we will see additional borders open particularly between those countries with low infection rates and/or advanced vaccination programs. Turning to the second quarter. If spending levels continue on their current trajectory, we would expect Q2 net revenues to grow around a low to mid-20s growth rate year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. It is important to point out that this is just one potential scenario, which could be impacted by factors, such as more restrictive measures being put in place because of rising infections or the opening or closing of borders. In terms of operating expenses, we continue our disciplined expense management approach, while furthering our strategic imperatives and keeping an eye on top line growth. As we progress through the growth phase of the pandemic domestically, we will look to increase our investments in key areas such as digital, cybersecurity, data analytics, B2B and our multi-rail solutions, as well as begin to increase our advertising and marketing-related spend. For Q2, we expect operating expenses to grow at a rate in the low 20s versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. As a reminder, we are now beginning to lap the spending actions we took last year as the pandemic hit. With respect to acquisitions, we are pleased to have announced the planned acquisition of Ekata and have now closed on the transaction with Nets, and expect acquisitions will contribute about two to three ppt to revenue in Q2 and for the year. Similarly, acquisitions will contribute approximately nine to 10 ppt to operating expense growth in the second quarter and eight to nine ppt for the year. As a reminder, we discretely disclosed the impact of acquisitions for the year in which they close and the subsequent year after which time we do not split them up. Other items to keep in mind. Foreign exchange is expected to be a two to three ppt tailwind to net revenues and a three to four ppt headwind to operating expenses in Q2. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rate environment. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Thanks Jason. So, let me take your rebates and incentives question first. Look I mean rebates and incentives is really dependent on the timing of deals and how the volume and mix plays out. Having said that, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up sequentially as domestic spending recovers and new and renewed deals come online. I think you're aware about the fact that our domestic volumes are more indexed -- our rebates and incentives are more indexed to domestic volumes. There are less indexed to cross-border. So, depending on how that volume mix plays out things might move around. But generally speaking, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth to be up from current levels pretty much the remainder of the year as volumes recover. On your second question around OpEx, look as we look forward, we see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our topline growth and we will increase the investment we put forward towards our strategic priorities. And these are essentially the ones we've talked about growing our share of core payments, ensuring that digital experience for our customers, driving a broader set of services capabilities, executing on our digital strategy, as well as our B2B strategy. As we do this, we will keep an eye on both the topline as well as the bottom-line. And we will basically be very focused on making sure that we are making investments to drive the long-term growth of our business. And that's kind of the essential thing I'd like to leave you with which is we will continue to stay disciplined from an expense management standpoint. We see domestic spending is transitioning towards the growth phase which gives us confidence and vaccines are effective and they're being deployed at scale. So, we will keep an eye on all of those metrics, we will keep an eye on the topline and we will look to invest in the business to drive that long-term growth objective that we're talking about. So Darrin, just the one thing I'd kind of point out to you is and you can see this in the slide deck which we shared with you. You can see, how let's take something like cross-border and cross-borders card-not-present excluding travel, right? That as been indexed back to 2019 is showing pretty healthy growth rates. Now, as we come out of the pandemic, we expect a large part of that to stick. On the flip side, when you look what cross-border, travel-related indexation looks like in other words 2021, current spend levels relative to 2019 they're running at about 40%. So if you believe that travel comes back and we do believe that travel comes back, we see structurally the opportunity for upside growth coming from that as well. Just kind of bringing the whole picture together just to add to what Michael was saying. And kind of lends directly into your operating leverage question as well. Yes, Chris, I can give you a little bit of color on that. So when you think about first, the high-level answer to your question is the corridors are pretty widely dispersed across the globe. You could see generally speaking intra-Europe constitutes a fairly significant portion of our cross-border volumes. And you can see that from the metrics which we've been sharing with you. And so that will depend upon how travel opens up within the intra-Europe border as kind of point one. Now but we recognize also that intra-Europe is lower-yielding than the other cross-border volume. So and as you think about it you should think about it in that context. Secondly, what I'd tell you is US is an important outbound corridor, there's no question about that. But there are several corridors well beyond that. When I think about the Middle East and Africa, when I think about, what's going on in Asia Pacific, these are all important corridors. Take US to Canada another important corridor. US to Latin America and Mexico, these are all important corridors. I think the operative thing here is, at least what we are spending a lot of time thinking about is not only about the rollout of vaccines but what are governments doing to establish travel bubbles. So you've heard about Australia and New Zealand. You're hearing about Hong Kong, Singapore. You're hearing about China establishing some sort of bubble. So there's a lot of work which is currently underway in terms of seeing, is there a level of comfort to open up borders and to make it less onerous for people to travel. So it's kind of a three-prong thing as far as I'm concerned: it's vaccines; it's the opening up and establishing of border kind of protocol; and then the third is have you made it less onerous for people travel. And you've got to look at all those three, as you think about how cross-border travel comes back. Now, the proof points we've got so far are in corridors like US, Latin America, things have worked out pretty nicely. It's not that onerous. People are traveling. You've seen decent cross-border spend. Similarly in the UAE, you've seen decent cross-border spend. A lot of this \u2013 and one more reminder, a quick one I've got for you is, a lot of our cross-border travel volume is personal travel and we do expect personal travel will come back. And the leading indicator for that is we've seen it come back in the domestic environment pretty robustly. Now that you've taken away these quarantine requirements in the context with the US and several other countries. So that's the kind of color I just wanted to share with you as you think about how this will play out going forward. So I guess what I'd tell you, I'd tell you our experience based on what we've seen from the stimulus is this round of stimulus has actually come into the flow from a spending standpoint a lot more rapidly than the last round of stimulus had come through. What we've also experienced is that the dollar spent are not kind of once and done. So said differently people are saving. And then there is the trickle effect which comes to over a period of time. So it's our expectation that the impact of the stimulus will continue to be felt, but at a declining pace as time goes along, because we've started to see a lot of that come through in the early part right now. As I kind of just mentioned you can see that in the strength in the numbers we've got. And then on your question on services, solid quarter on services again. Look services continues to do really well. It does well from a revenue-generating capability. It also powers the core very effectively. You can see that in the way we're winning share. And I'm seeing a very strong pipeline in terms of what we're seeing from a services standpoint going forward. So I feel pretty good. And the way again I think about this is you have a set of existing capabilities. How do you deepen your penetration with your customer base, existing and new customers, and then you keep building on your services capabilities. For example, the acquisitions we've recently done and how did we contribute to growth on a going-forward basis. So I think when you add all of that up, I feel pretty good about our services growth trajectory going forward. Yes. I'll just make one more additional comment. When we think about account-to-account there's certainly the domestic flows and then there's the account-to-account cross-border. And I think we've got to kind of think about it in the composite because candidly we're seeing some very decent traction take place even in that cross-border space from an account-to-account standpoint. Michael mentioned this in his remarks where he talked about the traction we're having with the integration of Transfast being complete. And it's not only exclusive to Europe by the way. It's pretty much across the globe. So we think about it holistically including the cross-border categories. Yes. I think Michael you pretty much covered it. The point I'd make Craig in addition is obviously the increased secular shift which is taking place. I think you were alluding to the fact that the first point of replacement of cash happens to be debit. We're certainly seeing that come through. But like Michael said there will be some level of reversion to the mean. The one point I'd make is the way we look at it even from a product life cycle standpoint is people tend to start when you think about financial inclusion and you think about how people come into spending in electronic forms they start with prepaid then move to debit then they start getting their toe into credit. And that's just the natural evolution, which will take place. We want to have a balanced portfolio. We want to win across the board and we want to be ready to actually address those spend as they come across debit and/or credit. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everyone. So here are the headlines. We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter. We're encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre-pandemic trends. We continue to execute against our strategic objectives as we signed notable new deals, advanced our multi-rail strategy by closing our transaction with Nets and extended our digital identity capabilities with the planned acquisition of Ekata. So let's dive in looking at the broader economy first. Domestic spending levels showed continued improvement with very strong e-commerce sales. According to our quarter one spending pulse report, which is based on all tender types, U.S. retail sales were up 11.8% versus a year ago ex-auto ex-gas. This reflects the impact of fiscal stimulus and the lapping of the start of the pandemic. Spending costs also indicated that overall European retail sales got close to flat in quarter one versus a year ago. The vaccine rollout has become scaled in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries. And broadening this critical effort is underway, but will take time. Let's start with our business specifically and the four phases framework we established for managing through the COVID environment. At this time last year, markets were going through the containment and stabilization phases. We now believe many markets are transitioning from the normalization phase to the growth phase domestically. Cross-border travel spending continues to be in the stabilization phase where spending is restricted due to closed borders. Looking at Mastercard spending trends, volumes continued to improve quarter-over-quarter with strength across products. We saw particular strength in debit, primarily driven by fiscal stimulus and share gains. In terms of how people are spending e-commerce continues to be strong and we're seeing improvements in card-present spending. On the travel front, we've seen some recent improvements in domestic travel, primarily personal travel. Cross-border travel remains limited as border restrictions remain in place for most markets. Cross-border card-not-present spending excluding online travel spend continues to hold up well. As we have observed in many markets progress is not always linear. And we believe there's significant pent-up demand for travel as we've just seen in domestic travel. We expect domestic travel to improve progressively throughout the year in countries with strong vaccination programs. International travel should start to open on a select basis in the second half of the year between countries, the strong vaccination programs and/or low case rates. In the meantime, we remain focused on building on our already strong position in travel engaging travelers early through our loyalty programs and expanding relationships with our partners in travel. As a result we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity when it occurs. As we look forward and see positive momentum in the drivers that impact our top-line growth, we will increase the investment we put toward our strategic priorities; one, growing our share of payments; two, deploying a broader set of services; three, enabling digital solutions; and four, providing choice with multi-rail capabilities. As always we will do this with an eye towards driving top and bottom line growth over the long-term along with expense discipline. Let me illustrate how we're executing against each of these strategic priorities. I will begin by sharing how we're driving growth in the core, always supported by differentiated services capabilities. Here are a few key examples. Building on our strength in U.S. retail co-brands, we're excited that Mastercard was chosen as the exclusive network for Gap Inc.'s co-branded credit cards across the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. This partnership will include a re-imagined rewards program to drive increased customer engagements with the migration of existing card members planned for 2022. We've had a long-term services relationship with Gap, which led to additional opportunities to support both their co-brand programs and their broader business.  We're also leveraging our differentiated service to expand relationships with key global partners like Santander. This quarter we signed a new deal with Santander Brazil and executed a long-term exclusive partnership with Superdigital Santanders fintech arm to provide digital prepaid accounts across seven Latin American markets. Also, we're happy to announce that the financial arm of one of the largest retailers in Europe, El Corte Ingles is migrating its entire closed-loop consumer credit portfolio to Mastercard exclusively for 10 years. This strategic partnership includes our processing capabilities and will contribute to growing Mastercard's overall credit share in the region.  Talking about share, I'd also like to point out that the migration of Santander UK debit portfolio is progressing well and we're preparing for the other conversions to be previously announced.  Finally, we secured several strategic renewals and expansions. As many of you know, Huntington Bank announced its anticipated acquisition of TCF at the end of last year, which will make them a top 10 US regional bank. I'm happy that they have decided to both renew their existing business with us and convert the TCF business to Mastercard. This brings significant new debit volume to our brands. We've also expanded our relationship with Synchrony Bank as the exclusive partner for their general purpose consumer credit portfolio.  Turning to the next strategic priority. We continue to enable digital solutions to drive the secular shift to electronic payments. A great example of this can be seen through the partnerships we have established with several leading mobile telecom providers across Africa and other regions.  In Africa, there are more mobile money accounts than bank accounts and consumers increasingly expect digital financial services to be provided through their mobile phones. Now we signed a multi-year partnership with the MTN group to enable millions of their MTN mobile money wallet customers with a Mastercard virtual payment solution.  We've also expanded our partnership with the Airtel group to equip their Airtel money customers with virtual cards and QR solutions. And we've extended our partnership with the Airtel Payments Bank in India along with the recent investment in Airtel Mobile Commerce. While our digital capabilities are enabling us to penetrate new geographies, our multi-rail strategy is allowing us to provide greater choice and capture new payment flows.  We're happy that we have now completed the acquisition of the majority of the Corporate Services division of Nets, which reinforces our leadership position in providing real-time payments infrastructure and applications. This transaction significantly enhances our application capabilities inclusive of a robust set of bill payment solutions which are operating at scale across several markets.  Furthermore, this is an integral component of our regional strategy in Europe enabling us to operate as a local partner. We see significant opportunity to expand these capabilities into additional markets around the world.  Speaking of Bill Pay in the US, we continue to scale our Bill Pay Exchange solution through new billers and bank partners. We're excited to announce that Verizon will connect as the most recent national biller on the platform. Turning to cross-border applications. We have now fully integrated our acquisition of Transfast and can now provide unsurpassed reach via a single point of access that allows banks and digital partners to send and receive money through bank accounts, mobile wallets, cards and cash payouts to over 90% of the world's population in more than 100 countries.  We're expanding our relationships with the United Nations Federal Credit Union, Saudi British Bank to expand their reach into additional markets. And both Bancorp and IDT payment services will now leverage our capabilities for cross-border advantages. And in addition, we have extended our partnership with Western Union who will be using our capabilities to allow customers in 18 European countries to transfer funds directly to debit cards in near real time. Our multi-rail capabilities are critically important to our efforts in open banking as well. They enable us to provide our customers across banks and fintechs with greater flexibility in how they manage both payment and data flows. We're off to a strong start at Finicity as we've integrated our sales teams and already signed several new connectivity partners and application users. For example, we're live with our state-of-the-art API-based data access in several large banks including US Bank as well as with the leading payroll processor representing millions of employees. Finicity was also selected by companies like Upgrade, SWBC, MoCaFi, MoneyLion and TomoCredit to provide permission-based access to financial data to support a variety of use cases including mortgage, lending and of course, payments. We're expanding our open banking capabilities in Europe as well as we're now live with our Open Banking Connect solution with Lloyds Bank in the UK for consumers to make payments to their credit cards. We continue to see a great deal of interest and activity in digital currencies and we're innovating in this space through new crypto and CBDC partnerships enabling digital currencies on our network and continuing our investments and underlying blockchain technology as part of our multi-rail strategy. We have several new crypto partnerships approved for launch this quarter including a partnership with Gemini, a leading crypto platform here in the US to launch a first of its kind cryptocurrency rewards credit card that allows consumers to receive crypto rewards on everyday purchases. And over in Spain, Crypton, a crypto exchange launching a Mastercard Crypto Card. On central bank digital currencies, we continue to engage with central banks around the world and our virtual testing platform is helping them design features similar issuance and evaluate interoperability with existing payment systems. In partnership with the Central Bank of Bahamas and Island Pay, we launched the world's first CBDC-linked payment card, enabling people to pay for goods and services using fiat currency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Digital identity. Digital identity is critically important as the shift to a digital economy continues. It is a foundational component of our multilayered approach to security, and have allowed us to help consumers and businesses safely and easily prove their identity, while enabling them to main control over their information. Last week, we announced the planned acquisition of Ekata, which advances the digital identity efforts we have underway. Ekata has access to validated identity information on a global basis and leverages artificial intelligence to produce highly accurate identity scores. Ekata's insights support multiple payment and non-payment use cases, including new account openings, instant issuance, and transaction risk checks, to be used by a broad range of customers, including leading digital merchants, financial institutions, travel companies, and digital currency platforms. This is an example of how we are entering into adjacent areas and innovating beyond the core payment transaction. And now back to the bigger picture. We're leveraging our business to have a broader impact on society by executing our commitment to bring one billion people into the digital economy by 2025. Specifically on the environmental front, we have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and issued a sustainability bond in the last quarter to support these efforts. Furthermore, our Mastercard carbon calculator developed in collaboration with Doconomy is enabled on our network to provide consumers, with a snapshot of carbon emissions generated by their purchases. We've worked with customers to issue over 10 million cards using sustainable materials. If we tie all of this together, we are now linking executive comp to Mastercard's sustainability priorities. With all of that in mind, I continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead, and I'm happy with the progress we're making against our objectives. And with that, Sachin over to you. Yes. Hi Harshita, thanks for the question. So, we're excited about Ekata. And it is a continuation of what we have been doing in digital identity. So, clearly it's a non-sustainable path forward in a more digital economy to have even more passwords, so that's pretty clear. So, identify is one pillar in our overall security strategy. So, we needed to strengthen up here. The -- we started that activity with a pilot that we launched in Australia about a year ago that is now going live in partnership with the Australian telecom Optus where we are introducing a reusable digital identity. What Ekata does is it accelerates our efforts and accelerates our efforts because Ekata has access to verifiable data points that allow to establish an identity. As I said earlier, they can in near real-time produce very accurate identity scores. And it comes along with a set of -- established set of global customers, digital merchants, cryptocurrency chains, financial institutions, and so forth. So, we were on the track. Ekata is accelerating our efforts. It sits right into our existing set of cyber solutions. It's at the start of the transaction. It's at the end of the transaction. And in between, we have our decision intelligence our various other transaction-focused solutions. So, it's a full package. It sets us apart. And as you can appreciate you linked this back to open banking as you asked the question, we are going beyond the payment transaction and such. And you need identity solutions for data transaction just as much as you do for digital identity use cases. All right. Darrin let me start off with the structural changes. I mean, that's the key question here. What makes a trend? What will stick? We have over the last 14 months on a monthly basis helped consumers around the world, small businesses around the world. And the input that we're getting from this research remains unchanged. And that is fundamentally starting with increasing consumer confidence, spending is going up. And then when you look at the way how people spend, what we're hearing is, when the pandemic subsides, 70% of people are saying, I'm going to continue to use more online commerce than I have before the pandemic. Almost 70% is saying the same thing for digital -- for digital banking. Almost the same number says more for contactless. And then you look at the other side of the coin and that is about 60% of people are saying, I will actually use less cash. So we believe that these trends of elevated -- anything elevated online will prevail, maybe not at the same levels, but they will be elevated. At the same time, we're already seeing that in countries where strong vaccination programs are there and social distancing measures are reduced, that the spend in store is coming back. So people do want to go and spend at the local restaurant or support the local shop in their local main street. So, the good thing is, we're ready for both with our solutions. So that is around consumer behavior, the changing consumer as we turn out of this nightmare. And then, you look at what else is going on. And what else are we seeing is with this push towards a more digital economy we're seeing there's more data around. And the thirst for data analytics is increasing. Our services teams can't be running fast enough to satisfy that thirst. If you look at more data, you look at an increasing cyber footprint. So our cyber solutions that is going to be -- it's going to be a continuing trend. Earlier we talked a little bit about our multi-rail strategy and what we're doing there. I talked about Europe and being the local partner. Government is interested in -- payments government is interested in real-time payments and crypto central bank digital currency. So this whole trend of government leaning in, I think is important. So our focus on our government vertical is going to help us there. And finally, just came across the news over the last couple of days is the dependence on international supply chains is showing up. It shows up in the context of vaccine distributions lately, but it has been showing up across many different industries. So, there is a real push to digitize supply chains, make them more flexible. And of course that comes to payments as well and comes to associated data flows. So B2B should also be seeing quite a push out of -- as we turn out of the pandemic. So, it's a shifting picture. And Darrin, I agree with you that there's a lot of things to feel positive about in terms of our strategy is on point for all these drivers. That's why we're increasing the investment behind these. And the second half of the question, I'll turn over to Sachin. Lisa, it's a great question. Let's take a look at CBDCs. I mean, across the whole crypto space, I mean where we want to play a role in CBDCs, we want to play a role in private stablecoins, we want to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets. So, it's a broader space. Specifically in CBDCs, I would describe it as relatively early days. So the engagement that we have and that's where we see our role to start with is to answer the question that you just asked in partnership with governments is what is the right construct? What is the role of the private sector? And where we came out and fortunately, as of late there's been a few thought leadership pieces involving, some of the leading central banks around the world including the ECB and the Bank of England and so forth is ideally there's a two-tier system, where the government takes the role of mining the currency so to say, as they do in fiat and the private sector takes the role of distributing it. And the private sector this comes to your question about the specific role that players could have including us is innovating around that. Innovating the true power of blockchain, what else could it do other than facilitating a payment. So I think there is \u2013 there's a direction that we like, where this is going. So concepts of interoperability are also very important because the utility for a consumer or business will only come when you can do something with the central bank digital currency. I think this example out of Bahamas is actually a very striking one. So here is a Mastercard partner program that allows you to spend on a CBDC unit that you have received at any place Mastercard is accepted. That's solving the last mile issue. Imagine how we could be doing this in so many countries. So is that engagement on model? Is that engagement on policy? Now as you try to do something like the Bahamas did, you've got to test it and try it. And for now that we see our second role in actually facilitating a real-life test bed, where you can iterate around the design and see how does this work. And that's not only for governments. Governments like that Sandbox, they engage, but it's also to pull in the commercial banks because it needs to go in conjunction if you have a two-tier system. So I see all of that and then I'll come to assume a scenario where this is in play and it exists in a given country. We just talked about the Bahamas. There's this last mile issue. But there's also been the questions of what other applications can ride on this infrastructure. And you've heard us talk about in the context of real-time payments, our go-to-market is always underlying infrastructure, application services and we intend to do the same thing here. And that is, what is an application that could ride on top of this? It could be a smart trade contract. So a smart contract technology is what we're investing in when I made the reference earlier reinvesting in further blockchain technology. And then of course there are services. Everybody right now is asking us, what should our blockchain strategy and our advisors team is all over that. And there will be cyber questions. Governments are raising the question when a blockchain comes along, is that a backdoor for hackers? So our whole cyber solution space is also geared up to engage. So I think there's a role to play for the private sector and there's a role to play very specifically for us to help the private sector and government. Thank you. Modeling was a queue here. This is clearly for Sachin. I just want to add one point here. So there's the deepening part into our existing customer set. As Sachin just said, you extend your capabilities. There's another vector here and that is extending in new segments. So as we're -- throughout the last couple of years in the front of a number of acquisitions like SessionM or APT we're finding that there's other adjacent segments that are needing these kinds of services. And as we go into these new segments that's also an opportunity for us to also then so to say cross-sell our payment solutions. So it works in different ways. And then the last thing to add obviously when it comes to our multi-rail strategy there's a growth dimension of extending our services across all new flows. Yes. Yes. So the first thing I would say, it's not entirely different from what we intended to buy. It's certainly different in terms of the expected time line. So it should have been a little faster than it was. Now but that aside, we were excited in August 2019 and we're excited on March 3 when we had Legal Day One and we welcomed the team in Copenhagen. And I'll tell you why we're excited. So with our existing set of multi-rail capabilities, particularly in the account-to-account space we're well positioned with VocaLink. VocaLink has strong infrastructure capabilities, applications and helped us to build the services business. What Nets does is, Nets gives us additional infrastructure capabilities because here's a significantly customizable high-end solution that VocaLink brings which works for large established markets that have had some journey in real-time payments. And then there's Nets which is a more nimble platform that allows us to deal with the smaller markets and take on more in a shorter period of time. So there's complementary assets here and that if you look across that, it makes us the one-stop shop partner, when it comes to real-time payments and that is unsurpassed. There's nothing else out there at this point in time. On the application side, I'm even more excited because here what we're having is -- we're not just getting technological capability with this purchase and we can bolt on to what we've already done in VocaLink. But we're getting scaled businesses that are live in market. There are strong bill payment propositions and volumes with large customer reach in particularly in the Nordics regions, but other parts of Europe as well. So we've identified Bill Pay as a growth opportunity sometime back here in the US and now we're bolting that on. And then we have the choice of taking some of our US capabilities into other parts of the world or do the same with Nets. So that is accelerating our growth in the application space which I'm particularly focused on. I think last, but not least that they have activities in the open banking space and few services around real-time payments. So that just rounds off the picture. And I come back to Legal Day One. We're getting a fantastic team of engineers and experts in this space that is just really rounding off of our capability side. Now the aspect on how this might look different. So Tien-Tsin you made that reference. And I all want to remind us there was a remedy that we had put on the table in kind of negotiations with the EU commission throughout the approval process. And it basically means, we will license the Nets infrastructure technology to a licensee and the licensee was identified as part of the approval process. That allows -- but that is on the infrastructure side not much of an issue because we have other assets to compete and then we can use it ourselves. So we're not excluded here. The package of having infrastructure application and service altogether, I think makes such a differentiated proposition that we were quite happy to give that remedy. It made the EU commission happy. And it comes back to the point about -- yes this is particularly important in Europe because in Europe being seen as a true European partner, we have the commission put a stamp of approval on this transaction and that works well for us. But we're going to take it elsewhere for sure. I mean that's the whole plan. Yes Dave that's a great question. Throughout the last quarter calls, we make references to engagements on the government front and oftentimes that involve our progress and our engagement with governments on account-to-account. And there are other things obviously that we had to dial down throughout the pandemic because there simply was no appetite in the market but account-to-account wasn't one of them. We never missed a single step there and neither did government. This was really driven by a lot of governments trying to get stimulus money into their citizens' hands and they couldn't do it fast enough and they couldn't do it in an efficient-enough way. So the focus and the light shed on real-time payment infrastructure was -- certainly helped. So I would see there is an increasing engagement around account-to-account. Throughout the pandemic if you look at what else was going on you saw the 2-factor authentication thing in Europe for -- strong customer authentication I think is the actual technical term there. That moved forward throughout the pandemic. So the government the financial sector players in Europe advanced that and that was broadly it. And then you look at what we've done with open banking. I mentioned it earlier. That's again a regulator-driven aspect of payments and the broader financial services here at Tesco. We talked about that last quarter I think in our Lloyd's. So there is momentum. I think it's actually literally a shot in the arm rather than anything else. Sachin do you have anything to add? Thanks very much. Appreciate your intake. Yes. So Trevor I think your question specifically is around domestic assessment yields correct? Just want to be sure. Yes. Look I mean we've seen a little bit of recovery in domestic assessment yields in the first quarter relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter. That number kind of moves around right? And it moves around -- there's a whole bunch of stuff which is kind of going on in there. Because remember in the denominator when you're doing yield calculations we talk about GDV. I think the natural instinct is to think about GDV only as domestic volumes. It's a composition of domestic and cross-border volumes. Whereas the numerator, which is domestic assessments is only the revenue we own on our domestic volumes. So depending on how that mix moves around you're going to see that yield move around as well. And then there are other moving parts in domestic assessments, the card fees and those kind of things which are actually featured in there as well. But by and large I would tell you between the fourth quarter of 2019 going into the first quarter of 2021 our yields have held pretty steady if I take those two endpoints. They bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but they're now pretty steady. Sure. Good morning. Craig let me take this and then see if Sachin has anything to add. So throughout the pandemic as you rightly said there was clearly a relative rise in debit over credit transactions. The way I look at this is this is a time of economic uncertainty frankly uncertainty general. And in those times people generally prefer to spend money they have and have more control over that. So that is what we've seen in previous crises so no surprise there that is crisis-induced. We see debit benefit from stimulus payments because they are attached to a bank account. So we saw that. And then you look at how the mix of spending has changed in terms of overweight to everyday spend versus discretionary spend and that is just -- there's a lot of historical consumer behavior ingrained in that is that you use debit for more everyday spend. That is what we're seeing in many markets around the world and that has played out here as well. So now the question is what of that is going to stick back to what we said earlier in terms of trends? And in the end that's hard to predict. I do think what we're going to see is that the crisis in use spend is -- the trigger there is going to go away because this nightmare will be over at some point hopefully soon. And you will also see that the discretionary spend categories are coming back. We're already seeing this in the last three weeks when I look at the first three weeks of April here. So you start to see travel strong travel programs. And it's very I think reasonable to expect that a lot of that is going to drive credit growth back up. So we're going to see a bit of a balancing. Now for us I think the strategy has to be we have to have the best solutions across debit and credit and frankly beyond cards as well because we just talked about earlier how the overall payment landscape is changing. And that's where the focus is. That's why we lean in on the travel side, but that's also why we lean in on debit. And you're right NatWest, Deutsche, Santander it's in conversion right now as I said earlier and that's going to be good for us and we try to bring our best solutions forward with consumers. So Sachin, I don't know if you have anything to add. All right. Thanks, Warren. So, first of all, thanks for your questions. I'd love to go on for a while but be mindful of time. Just the key takeaways bring it all together. It's -- we're back in the growth phase domestically that's fantastic. We're ready for the return of travel. When it comes it's going to be selective second half of the year. We keep strong focus on our strategic priorities. I don't have to repeat them again. We're excited about Nets as I just laid out. And we are excited and hopeful that we will close Ekata as soon as possible. So all that is good. None of this would happen without our people and I do just want to recognize that. It's been 14 months that's a marathon. And our folks are running it hard and that is a big shout out. I sent a note to the whole team this morning with our results and told them that that momentum that we were just sharing with you is really entirely their doing. With that I'm going to leave you to it and look forward to speak to you in a quarter from now. Thank you very much and thanks for all your support."

Q4 and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, we\u2019ll open up the call for the Q&A session. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s get right into it. So, starting with the big picture. Consumer spending has remained resilient, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. We closed out the year with strong financial results and several notable wins. Quarter four net revenues were up 17% and adjusted operating income up 19%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items. While the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we are keeping a close eye on a variety of positive and negative factors. The broadly resilient labor market with low unemployment and rising wages, coupled with elevated consumer savings levels, are key drivers of consumer spending. We\u2019re also tracking efforts by the central banks to curb inflation, along with moderating energy prices and the reopening of China. So, still lots of moving pieces. From an overall consumer spending standpoint, we expect the consumer to be relatively resilient. Spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China. In terms of switched volumes, domestic volumes in the fourth quarter remained steady relative to 2019 levels with some slight moderation in the U.S. related to lower gas prices recently. Cross-border travel continued to recover in quarter four with inbound travel either flat or up in every region sequentially relative to 2019 levels. As of the first three weeks of January, inbound cross-border travel to all regions is now above 2019 levels. We will continue to monitor the economic environment closely, and should the outlook change, we\u2019re prepared to move quickly to adjust our spending levels as we have done in the past. In the meantime, we continue to focus on the things we can control. This starts with our three strategic priorities: expanding in payments; extending our services; and embracing new networks. And here are some examples of how we\u2019re progressing against each of these. Starting with payments. We won substantial new business this quarter. Our innovative products, differentiated services and partnership approach enabled us to secure major portfolio flips, extend relationships and launch new programs with banks, co-brand partners and transit systems around the world. I am very excited about our expanded partnership with Citizens to become their exclusive payments provider across all product portfolios in the United States. We will shift their debit portfolio to Mastercard, and we will maintain exclusivity on credit and commercial. Citizens selected Mastercard based on our digital assets, open banking capabilities and safety and security tools. We have also extended and enhanced our long-term partnership with Citi. It solidifies Mastercard as Citi\u2019s exclusive global partner for Citi-branded consumer credit, debit and small business cards. We look forward to continuing to partner to deliver digital initiatives, new technologies and innovative payment solutions together. We\u2019ve extended our longstanding relationship with Bank of America across their consumer and small business debit and credit lines of business. They\u2019re great partners. We\u2019re especially proud to continue as the lead brand for all newly issued small business cards. And our positive momentum with Chase continued this quarter as well. Building up on our recent co-brand, commercial and Pay-by-Bank partnership announcements, we are excited to announce that we have renewed the Chase Freedom Flex portfolio. Turning to the UK, we recently extended our credit deal with NatWest Group for consumer and commercial. We\u2019re partnering with Belbim, [ph] Istanbul transportation to convert over 17 million closed-loop cards, Mastercards and add 24,000 new acceptance locations across the city. We\u2019ve partnered with QNB Finansbank and Trendyol, a large e-commerce marketplace in Turkey, over 30 million customers to launch a new Mastercard co-brand credit product. Now, an important driver of our success in core payments is our ability to deliver innovation and thought leadership. We are designing and deploying innovation solutions at scale, as a result, are the clear partner of choice for our customers. Three recent examples include our work in Installments, Tokenization and Click to Pay. Starting off with installments. SoFi launched Pay in 4, becoming the first bank in the U.S. to launch within the Mastercard Installments program. SoFi valued the broad acceptance, strong consumer protections and commission-based open banking capabilities that all make Mastercard Installments unique. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline for Mastercard Installments and plan to add several additional programs across multiple regions throughout the year. Turning to Tokenization. We surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions per month and for the year, we are up 38%. We\u2019re currently enabling digital transactions in over 110 countries. Tokenization helps keep the ecosystem safe and secure across a wide range of use cases. One example that I think is particularly cool is the work we are doing with in-car payments. We\u2019re working with car manufacturers and fintechs to integrate payments using our tokenization platform and biometric authentication capabilities. Think about the simplicity it brings to paying for gas, tolls, charging or entertainment right from your car. This is a great example of Mastercard working with partners to drive the convergence of the Internet of Things, 5G and addressing consumer demand for cool digital experiences. It also highlights how we\u2019re expanding the reach and the value of our acceptance network through new channels to support new use cases. This is just the beginning. Watch for more to come in the space. And on Click to Pay, we partnered with Adyen to launch Click to Pay on their global payment platform, recognizing the value that it brings to guest checkouts and millions of online shoppers. Adyen joins more than 20 other payment service providers around the world, bringing Click to Pay to thousands of merchants globally. Now this focus on innovation and partnership is also a critical part of our strategy to penetrate the prioritized set of new flows that we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day. We continue to make solid progress. Here are some of examples how we\u2019re driving growth in each area. First, disbursements and remittances. Mastercard Send and our cross-border services capabilities are solving for an expanding set of use cases across multiple geographies. For example, we partnered with social marketplace platform, Poshmark, to enable seller payouts. And for cross-border payments, we\u2019ve teamed up with Paysend to broaden our global reach and expand the ability to send international payments across card brands. Second, we\u2019re deploying digital capabilities to displace cash and check-based commercial payments at the point of sale, huge opportunity. In France, we signed an agreement with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to develop their corporate card book. And in South Korea, we partnered with KakaoBank and Samsung Card to launch new debit and credit co-brand offerings for small businesses. The third flow is B2B accounts payable payments. Our virtual card capabilities provide an effective digital solution to address the working capital, process efficiency and data challenges that are prevalent in B2B. We are a global leader in virtual card. We\u2019re seeing rapid growth in this space. We\u2019re bolstering our position through new partnerships and capabilities. For example, we announced plans to partner with Sabre and confirm our pay to accelerate the use of virtual cards for B2B travel payments. We also signed an agreement with fintech partner, Extenet, to offer virtual mobile corporate cards in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, on the consumer bill payment front, we are focused on deploying market-specific solutions to meet unique needs of consumers and businesses. For example, in Norway, we are powering the eFaktura service, which is used by the vast majority of citizens to pay their bills. In 2022, we hit a milestone as over 200 million digital invoices were sent using eFaktura. As you can see, we\u2019re making significant progress expanding in payments, and we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. Now turning to the second of our three strategic priorities, services. Services provide differentiation and diversification for Mastercard. Our strategy is to leverage our services to drive growth at the core and to expand into new segments and use cases. We\u2019re making steady progress on both and have significant opportunity for future growth. Our services continue to drive growth in the core as evidenced by our wins and extensions with Citizens, Citi, NatWest and others, as I mentioned earlier. One example of a service that enhances the value of payments is Consumer Clarity. The service provides cardholders with merchant details in digital receipts to reduce disputes, low charge-back costs and improve the consumer experience. We recently partnered with TSYS who will offer Consumer Clarity to over 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the UK. In 2022, we signed up over 50 financial institutions and merchant partners for Consumer Clarity, including large issuers like Ita\u00fa in Brazil. We\u2019re also expanding our services to new segments and new use cases, including governments, retailers, digital partners and financial institutions. This quarter, we partnered with research and consulting firms, including EFO and SEMA [ph] in Germany, as well as the Barbados Ministry of Tourism and International Transport to provide governments with detailed insights into tourism and retail spending trends. We engage with retailers like Lowe\u2019s who are leveraging our Test & Learn capabilities to conduct analytics on their core business. We partner with large fintechs like Monzo in the UK. to advise on product development strategies. And we are deploying our personalization solutions, which we acquired through Dynamic Yield, across a range of retail and financial institutions, including Carrefour, Argentina, Height, [indiscernible] to enhance and scale their personalization efforts. I\u2019m very encouraged by the continued momentum in our services growth strategy and the differentiation and diversification that these capabilities bring. I\u2019ll now move on to our third strategic priority, which is embracing new networks, namely open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight an example of how our open banking capabilities have come together with our other strategic priorities to offer a new solution. As I mentioned earlier, in quarter four, JPMorgan Payments and Mastercard announced an innovative Pay-by-Bank solution. Solution utilizes the MasterCard open banking platform to modernize existing ACH payments and allow customers to pay bills from their bank account in a frictionless manner. Pay-by-Bank offers choice and provides a simple and secure experience of billers and merchants as well as consumers by enhancing existing ACH transactions. This deal is a manifestation of our multi-rail strategy, expands our addressable market by our open banking capabilities, and it deepens our relationship with JPMorgan Chase. We\u2019re actively working with them to take the solution to market this year. We also continue to make our progress with open banking in Europe. Mastercard is connected to more than 3,000 banks and financial institutions across 18 markets to power their open banking efforts. This quarter, we partnered with Secure Trust Bank in the UK, who will leverage our open banking capabilities to provide safe and convenient ways for their customers to repay retail loans directly from their bank account. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and the continued recovery in cross-border travel. In payments, we won substantial new business this quarter, including Citizens. We\u2019re expanding our differentiated services and embracing new networks, including leveraging our open banking capabilities to power solutions, like JPMorgan\u2019s Pay-by-Bank. With all that, we\u2019re well positioned for the opportunities ahead. We will manage the business with agility, should the macroeconomic outlook change. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning now to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 17%, supported by a resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 16%, which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 19% year-over-year to $2.65, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $590 million through January 23, 2023. So, let\u2019s turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV [Technical Difficulty] by 14%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 14%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 1%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 8% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 7%. Cross-border volume was up 31% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. Turning now to page 5. Switched transactions grew 8% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 18% year-over-year in Q4. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 56% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3.1 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let\u2019s turn to page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide gross dollar volume grew 8%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 40%, while cross-border volumes increased 31%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 8%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 16%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our cyber & intelligence and data & services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 18%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving on to page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs. Turning to page 8. Let\u2019s discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of January compared to Q4 2022. Each of these metrics, with the exception of cross-border card-not-present excluding travel, were favorably impacted by the lapping of the slower growth that occurred in January 2022 related to the Omicron variant. Switched volumes grew 21% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q4. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 4 ppt versus Q4. Overall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year, up 2 ppt from Q4. A couple of administrative notes, for your reference to help you understand the trends in the business, ex Russia, we have suspended -- where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from this schedule, if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. Additionally, as the impacts of the pandemic recede, going forward, we will no longer provide operating metric levels as a percentage of 2019. Turning now to page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. Let me start by saying that I believe that we are well positioned to address the significant growth opportunities at hand. We have established a clear set of strategic priorities and are making steady progress against each of them. This is evidenced by the many wins across the products and services Michael has discussed on this call and over time. On the macroeconomic front, as Michael laid out, we are monitoring a number of both, positive and negative factors. We do expect consumer spending to hold up relatively well in this environment, driven in part by the strong labor market. It is important to remember that we are coming off a year of strong growth as we lap the effects of the pandemic, and we expect our go-forward growth rates to moderate accordingly. From a cross-border travel standpoint, most regions have recovered and are well above 2019 levels in Q4. The exception is Asia, where there is still room to improve with China reopening. Just a little further context here. China represented about 1% of inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at approximately 20% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, China represented about 2% of outbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at about 50% of Q4 2019 levels. With this in mind, our base case scenario for the full year 2023 is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the euro relative to U.S. dollar. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to carefully manage our expenses as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of a high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 of a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind for the year. Turning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low-double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items and reflects generally resilient consumer spending. A couple of points to note. Q1 will be the last quarter in which we experience the lapping effect of our decision to suspend operations in Russia in Q1 of 2022. And we expect cross-border volume growth in Q1 2023 to be elevated as a result of the effects of Omicron in Q1 2022. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a high-single-digit rate versus a year-ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% in Q1 and 18% to 18.5% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Sachin. Audra, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: So Mike or Sachin, I wanted to ask about Pay-by-Bank. Over the years, you\u2019ve developed and acquired capabilities for Pay-by-Bank in different countries. You talked about this new partnership with JPMorgan. But a skeptic could also argue that Pay-by-Bank is a risk to cards longer term, and there\u2019s some precedence in countries. So, can you talk about the push and pull for severe? And also maybe touch upon where is Pay-by-Bank being used versus cards and how\u2019s Mastercard able to participate in those transactions? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Right. Harshita, let me start off on that. So, the way we think about this is in the end, it is about delivering choice to consumers, choice of merchants, choice to banks, and we are therefore in all relevant ways to pay. But it\u2019s also true that the card ecosystem over the years has driven tremendous value. So, it is a prevalent way to pay for many, many use cases. But on the side, we have alternative payment methods emerging. And we look at those as options to go after new use cases, and that\u2019s exactly what happened here in the context of our partnership with JPMorgan. This is focused on existing ACH payments, which are not bringing the value to the biller or the consumer that they are looking for. Frankly, though, very specifically, what we\u2019re doing here, the issue with some of these account-to-account payments is you never really know what balance is on the account. And our open banking capabilities are really providing a payment success factor here that tells the biller this is a good time to debit this particular account, so true value brought that somebody is willing to pay for, in this case, the biller/the merchant. So, a good example of where there can be value created an alternative payment tools while this doesn\u2019t take away from the power the cards are bringing to consumers and merchants. So, we see this as coexistence. Where this is going over time, we don\u2019t quite know, but our multi-rail strategy positions us well to play in either field.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Nice job on the quarter and the year. When we look ahead, and we\u2019re looking at the trend you\u2019re showing us for January, even despite easier comps on Omicron, it does look like you have pretty conservative assumptions built into the guide for the year for top line growth of low double digits. Just given the trends we\u2019re seeing even beyond January, but ex Russia, you anniversary that after March, and the numbers go materially higher growth rates. So, can you just tell us if there\u2019s some building blocks like around what you\u2019re assuming on macro -- from today\u2019s macro activity going forward and maybe rebates incentives, is that a factor here? Thanks again, guys.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Darrin. Good morning. So, let me provide you a little bit of color here. Look, I mean, what we\u2019ve generally assumed in our base assumptions that I mentioned when I was delivering my prepared remarks is resilient consumer spending through 2023. I mean, we see a resilient consumer today, and we\u2019re seeing a generally resilient consumer spending pattern going forward in our base case. The other thing which we\u2019ve contemplated, as we mentioned, from a cross-border standpoint, and particularly cross-border travel standpoint, the vast majority of the regions have now reached that state where they are kind of growing and growing at a healthy pace, but they\u2019re not growing at an accelerating pace. So, they\u2019ve reached that level of stability. So, let me give you a little bit of color here. You\u2019ll remember as we are coming out of COVID, right, intra-Europe came back first cross-border standpoint. After that, we saw several inter markets come back from a cross-border standpoint, U.S., UK, Canada, Latin America, all of those. All of those are growing at a healthy pace, and we\u2019re assuming they\u2019ll continue to grow at a healthy pace but not at an accelerating pace. The one area where we are assuming an increase in terms of growth is around Asia Pacific. I mean, Asia Pacific has been a lagger in terms of recovery of cross-border travel. And we\u2019re expecting that there will be -- with the borders recently opening in several markets in AP that there will be some level of recovery, which will come through there when you index back to 2019. So, that\u2019s kind of generally been the base case we\u2019ve kind of assumed. Look, I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, I think that the reality is we\u2019ve got things which are helping us from a share win standpoint. We\u2019ve got strong consumer spending, our services capabilities continuing to grow at a healthy pace, all of that is built into our guide as we go forward. Also remember that in 2022, we did have elevated levels of FX volatility which were there in the market, which actually supported the growth rate which we had in 2022. It\u2019s hard to predict, but that looks like on a going-forward basis, we do our best assumptions on that from an FX volatility standpoint. But that\u2019s kind of the building blocks as to how we\u2019ve gone about building our business. The last point I\u2019ll make is around rebates and incentives, you asked the question. As you can see, quarter-over-quarter, [ph] we talk about how we are delivering wins. We are winning with new customers. We are expanding our business with existing customers. So, we are building in assumptions from a rebates and incentive standpoint, which will be consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in our track record from a winning standpoint as it relates to us.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Ellis at SVB MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Michael, I wanted to follow up in your prepared remarks related to new flows. You highlighted that that B2B POS payments as a notable opportunity area and highlighted a few new SMB co-brand wins there. Can you just talk a little bit more holistically about this opportunity? Remind us, a, how big it is; and then b, what\u2019s different about it? What do you have to do differently as Mastercard to capture this opportunity relative to the consumer side? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Right, Lisa. So, the opportunity here lies really in taking our existing set of tools, namely from the card ecosystem, very specifically the virtual card capability, which came through an acquisition many, many years ago that we\u2019ve now built out -- ourselves into the leader here. So this existing set of tools and a huge opportunity in terms of flows to be addressed and make them more efficient, we\u2019re looking at $14 trillion from an opportunity perspective. If you recall what we laid out across the 4 flows, new flows, this is the -- one of the large ones here that we quoted. And the way to go about this is really to say, all right, who are the different players that we already have in our ecosystem. We bring BCNs in too. There\u2019s a lot of deals with financial institutions, but there\u2019s also a lot of deals with partners out in the travel space, and the travel space is really the one that\u2019s been most promising for us, and that is coming back right now. So this is a near-term opportunity. Cash and checks dominated existing tools, existing partners. This is right for us to go after it, and we\u2019re leaning in.\nSachin Mehra: And Lisa, maybe I can just add a little bit out here, particularly as you think about the virtual card opportunity, which Mike just talked about. The differentiation, which is provided by technology which is what Michael talked about by virtue of the acquisition, which we had with our virtual card capabilities, but there\u2019s also differentiation in terms of our approach from a go-to-market standpoint. And specifically, when you target flows from a go-to-market standpoint, you go on a vertical-by-vertical basis. So, as you know, we\u2019ve been very successful in the travel vertical. Part of the reason we\u2019ve been successful in the travel vertical is having a deep understanding of what it takes at the travel integrator level to be able to embed your technology there so that you are the payment choice, which people will exercise when they have to make those payments. Similarly, as we look at that opportunity going forward, there are several other verticals we\u2019re making the similar kinds of advances in. So, that\u2019s specific as it relates to the BCN piece. But you also asked about small business and the commercial point-of-sale opportunity, which is there. And the reality is we\u2019ve been winning significant new deals in that small business opportunity. And we see, candidly, a very sizable market opportunity in commercial point of sale, a large part of that is still in cash and check. And the reality is, just like we did in B2M where we displace cash and check utilizing digital technologies and innovation, that\u2019s kind of the advances we\u2019re making also in commercial point of sale. So, that\u2019s how we kind of see and frame the opportunity set across both of these areas.\nMichael Miebach: You can hear it. It helps you have a CFO that used to be the head of our Commercial Products.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask just big picture, if you would characterize visibility here for us on revenue versus, I guess, you can go back to pandemic or pre-pandemic. Just curious on visibility given you mentioned lots of moving pieces. And then, same thing on expenses, you said in the prepared remarks here that you\u2019re prepared to adjust investments, if necessary. If the base case and the outlook here is to show some operating leverage, can we assume the same operating leverage if revenue weakens relative to expectations? Sorry for the long question.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Tien-Tsin. So, on your question around revenue, it\u2019s like I laid out, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we put our base case together. We\u2019ve kind of laid out what our assumptions are from a base case standpoint. And at the end of the day, we don\u2019t have the crystal ball to actually suggest that that is the way things are going to play out. But based on everything we\u2019re seeing in the nature of current trends as well as leading indicators, particularly as it relates to the overall strength of the labor market, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing from a base case standpoint as it relates to the outlook for revenues. As it relates to one component of revenues, which we oftentimes think about is around -- on an as-reported basis versus what it is on a currency-neutral basis, very hard to predict where foreign exchange markets go. But again, we\u2019ve seen recent strengthening of the euro take place, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of shared with you in terms of our assumptions from an FX standpoint. And then, you asked about operating leverage. Look, I mean, the reality is we\u2019ve always operated with the philosophy of delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. We look at the top line. We look at how our expense is up also against that top line. We have, in the past, demonstrated our capability to modulate our expenses to the extent we start to see adverse impacts take place on the top line and vice versa. And the reality is what we don\u2019t want to do is impact the long-term growth potential of our business. So, we will continue to invest in our business with our eye on the long term. We will be prudent about not going into spaces from an OpEx standpoint, which are not in demand. Obviously, I\u2019m kind of stating the obvious here. But the reality is the philosophy remains unchanged. We will look to deliver positive operating leverage as a company. And we have the tools and the ability to actually modulate expenses if top line -- if we feel like the top line growth is going to get impacted over the long term.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: First off, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting rid of the relative to 2019 metric, for good reason. Just a question on cross-border and sort of the operating assumption this year. I know there\u2019s a number of different trends that you guys talked about. But there\u2019s still a decent amount of pent-up demand. I guess, how do you think cross-border travel behaves in a backdrop where macro might get worse from here? Maybe you could use some historical precedent here. Maybe just give us sort of how you\u2019re thinking about it. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So Sanjay, let me share a few thoughts on how we think about cross-border, right? So at the end of the day, there are numerous things which impact how people travel and spend in the cross-border environment. But at the outset, what I want to say is that the fundamentals around the cross-border proposition as delivered by Mastercard actually stand to be very sound just like they were in the pre-pandemic days. We said this through the pandemic, and it\u2019s played out in that manner. Now, let me get a little bit more specific as it relates to pent-up demand -- your question around pent-up demand. The reality is we all know from what we hear on the earnings calls of airlines that capacity is constrained from an airline standpoint. And with that constrained capacity and elevated prices, you\u2019re seeing that impact come through when you do P times Q, which is price multiplied by quantity, you get kind of what the resultant impact from a spend standpoint is. Fast forward, as capacity comes back online, one would expect that people will -- there will be some level of adjustment in prices because the demand-supply equation gets a little bit more in equilibrium. And so overall, we\u2019re not assuming that that necessarily results in a tailwind because capacity comes back online, right, because there\u2019s going to be an adjustment which takes place from a price standpoint. Our view -- again, we hope we\u2019re wrong, and we hope cross-border spending kind of goes with more capacity, prices remain elevated and people continue to spend, but we\u2019ve got to take a point of view on that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking. The other point I\u2019ll make is, as it relates to what the impact of FX rates is on cross-border and cross-border travel. The reality is what we\u2019ve seen historically is that when exchange rates move, for example, with the dollar strengthening, with the lag effect, you would tend to see inbound into the U.S. get impacted. That\u2019s only natural. It gets more expensive for people coming from different parts of the globe to come into the U.S. But what we\u2019ve also seen is individual extend to then redirect that cross-border spend to other parts of the globe where they don\u2019t feel the impact of that come through. So, movements in foreign exchange rates, does have an impact on how we think about cross-border going forward.\nMichael Miebach: And just to add one point here, Sanjay, that is over the last two years, we\u2019ve been winning portfolios in the space. We\u2019ve really focused on the space, expecting to come back. If you recall, let me just remind everybody here, across airlines, across travel, our online travel agencies, across lodging, across other forms of transports like trains, Myriad, Virgin Atlantic, Amtrak, JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and so forth, we have won portfolios. And we\u2019ve bolstered that in terms of market access through these partners with additional products. So there\u2019s Mastercard Travel Rewards out there, which is now in 80 countries. So, we believe into the macroeconomic environment that Sachin just laid out, we have the better proposition. So, it remains an exciting space. The pace in which we\u2019ll grow, we\u2019ll have to see that is characterized by what Sachin just said, but we certainly have a differentiated proposition in that. And one last comment I want to make, Sanjay, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re excited about metrics and how we\u2019re changing the metrics. From a metrics perspective, I want to complete -- back to Lisa\u2019s question earlier. I mentioned the $14 trillion on commercial POS, but there\u2019s also $24 trillion on accounts payable, which makes the total opportunity in this combined space, $38 trillion. So, that conversation earlier was an important one on a very big part of our priorities.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: I really appreciate the China cross-border data you gave there for both inbound and outbound. I think you said that inbound is running at about 20% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter and outbound at about 50% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much improvement you\u2019re expecting in those metrics in 2023 as the reopening progresses? And then separately, can you just make any high-level comments on growth for each of your three strategic pillars in \u201823? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So first, Jason, I\u2019m not going to share specifics as it relates to how we built our model up for the full year. What I will share with you is as it relates to the recovery of both inbound and outbound for China, we have built in some level of recovery as the year progresses. It\u2019s our best estimate as to what we expect to happen by virtue of the borders opening and the quantity and requirements being lifted. But suffice it to say that the opportunity is pretty sizable. The fact that we were in Q4 at 20% of 2019 levels from an inbound travel standpoint, cross-border travel standpoint is just suggestive of the fact that if you just think about what\u2019s gone on around the regions and how they\u2019ve recovered and bounced right back and gone well above 2019 levels, there\u2019s a significant opportunity both on inbound and outbound as it relates to China. And sorry, the second part of your question, Jason?\nJason Kupferberg: Just the three strategic pillars, what you\u2019re modeling for revenue growth on those in \u201823?\nSachin Mehra: Again, I mean, when you -- the strategic priorities, we\u2019ve got payment services in new networks, as Michael has talked about. Look, I mean, I\u2019ll give you a general sense. I mean, you know about -- from a payment standpoint, we\u2019ve been doing this, and we\u2019ve been doing this for many decades, and that is the substantive part of how we deliver our revenue growth. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve shown you how services have grown and still growing at a healthy pace. In my view, the demand for our services capability still remains very strong. You\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been growing at a faster pace in services relative to the overall growth of our business. And I don\u2019t think we should assume anything different on a going-forward basis. And new networks is relatively nascent really. So again, I would put that into the space of it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s growing off a small base at a very healthy clip. But the reality is on the overall Mastercard, it\u2019s still to have a meaningful impact. So, that\u2019s kind of the best I can share with you on that.\nMichael Miebach: Jason, I\u2019d say the model really is one not of separate pillars. This is an integrated business proposition where services differentiates payments. And payments is oftentimes a way to build out a further -- a broader set of services and so forth. So, it kind of goes in the circle -- a virtuous circle, I have to say. When you look at it, the -- historically, we gave you a number a couple of years ago that service is a third of our quarter. It has been growing faster. I gave you an example earlier in my prepared remarks on Consumer Clarity, which is something that is transaction-related, and it\u2019s growing faster with 50 new issuers. So, there\u2019s just a lot of momentum in there. But, there is also the kind of services that are not related to the underlying payments business. For example, what the example I gave you on Test & Learn, where we\u2019re working with a set of customers to work on their base core business as in Lowe\u2019s, the example that I gave you. So, different sets of dynamics, but they go hand in hand, and that is the power of the differentiated and diversified business model that we have.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Rayna Kumar at UBS.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Rayna, are you on mute? Operator, let\u2019s go to the next, and try to get Rayna back on line.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Will Nance at Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance: Maybe I\u2019ll squeeze one last 2019 -- versus 2019 question before the metrics go away. When we -- some of the kind of moving pieces in December, it seems like across some of the metrics, things seem to take a little bit of a step down on the 2019 stack. So, just any color on what you\u2019re seeing on a regional basis between kind of e-commerce and travel and how those trends have kind of continued into January, maybe excluding some of the impacts of China that you\u2019re seeing? And then just a more numerical piece of that question as I -- appreciate the color you gave on the China metrics on inbound and outbound travel. Just wondering if you have any color on just the overall contribution of China to cross-border volumes?\nSachin Mehra: All right, Will. So, I\u2019ll take your questions in order out here. You talked about some color around how we\u2019re seeing things shape up in Q4 relative to 2019 levels. We\u2019re seeing pretty stable levels as it relates to switched volumes, switched transactions in cross-border, in fact, marginally up on each one of them quarter-over-quarter. So for example, in switched volumes in Q3 as a percentage of 2019, we were running at 154%; in Q4, we were running at 156%. And you can see this in the slide deck, which we shared with you. The one thing to just keep in mind is in the U.S. in Q4, we have seen a little bit of an impact come through from lower gas prices, and that\u2019s kind of being reflected in the numbers you see right here. You asked a question from a regional color standpoint. I\u2019d say there\u2019s remarkably consistent growth that we\u2019re seeing in most regions. For example, in Europe, Europe continues hold up pretty well. Latin America and EMEA are also actually holding up pretty well from a growth standpoint. In Q4, China was in the negative, particularly in its domestic volumes. And again, remember, our -- we don\u2019t generate a lot of revenue from the domestic side. But, it was impacted negatively because of the flareup in the COVID situation, which took place there. So that\u2019s one piece to keep in mind. Another piece to keep in mind is that from an India standpoint, we are -- now that we\u2019re out of the embargo and we\u2019ve started new issuance, you still have the tail effect of the embargo coming through. So said differently, the fact that you actually for a year were not issuing new cards in India has a resultant impact of attrition of old cards which are taking place, which need to be more than compensated for by issuance of new cards. And that takes time as issuers get ramped up and ready to go. So, you\u2019ve seen that come through in Q4 as well. But beyond that, I would say that we continue to see pretty good and consistent growth relative to 2019 levels across all our metrics here.\nMichael Miebach: And a step down compared to last year and the year before is, of course, there because you get the mathematics and the lapping effects and so forth. But to 2019, I think that\u2019s an instructive view here. And it tells us that, yes, we\u2019re expecting a resilient consumer will continue to spend.\nSachin Mehra: And, Will, you had asked the question about China. In my prepared remarks, I shared with you that China inbound cross-border travel pre-pandemic was roughly 1% of our total corresponding volumes, and our outbound -- the similar metric from an outbound standpoint was about 2%. So, I know that was the second part of your question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Togut at Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. For the year ahead, could you talk through some of your assumptions on the biggest opportunities in Europe, Germany, Poland, Italy, when you think about both economic outlook and cash digitization? We\u2019ve seen mixed reports 6, 9 months ago, more concerned about Europe given high gas prices. Now, it seems like the outlook has been a little better with lower gas prices and a more mild winter. But, any insights would be greatly appreciated.\nMichael Miebach: David, let me start off on that. So, looking at Europe really in three categories, there\u2019s the UK on one hand and there\u2019s emerging Europe and then there is Continental Central Europe, and slightly different picture on all of them. First of all, starting off with the continent. Here, the concern has been around for a while on rising gas prices and energy prices and the impact on the consumers\u2019 ability to spend. A combination of fiscal measures to provide cushions to consumers, along with energy-saving measures, along with the gas storage now reaching full capacity has really alleviated some of these concerns. So, we continue to see a fairly resilient European consumer. That\u2019s our base assumption as we look forward. UK, somewhat different economic outlook, and that might be a little more shaky there. But fundamentally, in this market, we are seeing a lot of tailwind for us from share gains over the last couple of years. So that works well for us. And emerging Europe continues to be a dramatic digitization opportunity as we\u2019ve seen in markets like Russia, which unfortunately is not in our P&L any longer. But we have seen very high digitization rates, and we\u2019re pushing that in these more emerging markets. Somewhere between, there\u2019s peculiarities like Germany, where there was a significant digitization opportunity, and there still remains. But we caught up a lot in Germany over the last two years, particularly on the contactless side, which is now reaching half of the transactions there. So, healthy mix in Europe and very strong share position with opportunities to come through from portfolio wins that we have shared with you over the last couple of years as they go into effect.\nSachin Mehra: And I\u2019ll just add, David, to Michael\u2019s point around the deals which we\u2019ve recently won and announced. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, we had talked about Santander historically. That migration is in progress. And we\u2019re through the bulk of a 9 million card migration there. We expect to be complete by early 2023 on that one. NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard debit cards in December of 2021. That\u2019s well underway, and we would expect some of that to continue to happen in 2023. And then, the other one we had spoken about historically was Deutsche Bank, and we expect that the migration of one will commence somewhere in the middle of 2023. So, just to give you a little bit of sense as to how we\u2019re kind of thinking about things.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: I just wanted to drill into a couple of things, now that we\u2019re getting rid of 2019 over the past few years. And looking forward, what has changed in terms of the growth algo? How should we think of that as we think of normalized growth visibility? And then, there\u2019s a smaller question with regards to - specifically for \u201823, the spread between [indiscernible] how should one think of that?\nSachin Mehra: I\u2019m going to need a little bit more clarity on the second part of your question, but we\u2019ll get to that. Let me take the first question first, which is as it relates to the growth algorithm. Just suffice it to say that the fundamentals of our business actually are very, very sound. The growth algorithm, which has actually enabled the strong growth we have delivered pre-pandemic, very much stands sound even today. So, the reality is, if you think about PCE growth, you think about the opportunity for the secular shift to electronic forms of payment, you think about the fact that we\u2019re growing market share, you think about how we\u2019re delivering on our services capabilities and driving growth from that, and now as we\u2019re doing new and different things around new payment flows as well as new networks, that growth algorithm actually is very sound, very stable, very consistent with what we\u2019ve historically had. And that\u2019s the way we think about the business for, call it, not only the near term but near medium to long term for Mastercard. Now, Ashwin, I\u2019m not sure I got the second part of your question. Could you repeat that, please?\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Yes. I was asking about the cross-border volume spread. How should one think of that as we think of this year?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Look, I mean, our cross-border proposition sound -- is very sound and stable. And I think at the end of the day, like I said, most of the regions are now back to what I would call, the stable growth rates that we would normally have seen in the pre-pandemic phase. The one exception is Asia, and there\u2019s a little bit of opportunity which we have in Asia, which we\u2019ve contemplated in our thoughts for 2023.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Ken Suchoski at Autonomous Research.\nKen Suchoski: Hi. Good morning, Michael and Sachin. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the cross-border recovery. We see the volumes for cross-border travel are well above 2019 levels. Where are you seeing the transactions versus 2019 levels on that same metric? Sachin, you made some interesting comments on price versus units. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much the cross-border travel volumes are benefiting from inflation and spend per transaction, and how much recovery is still left from a number of transaction standpoint. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Ken. So my comment is actually going to hold true for not only cross-border for -- largely for the business, if you think about it, right? You know our transactions or the growth in our transactions is impacted by our average ticket size. There are puts and takes on the average ticket size, not only in cross-border but even on domestic, which are influenced by numerous factors, one of which is inflation. The others are the mix between card-present and card-not-present. Because what happens is, typically, with more card-not-present, you tend to see a higher average ticket size, which results in lower transaction growth rate. Now, that being said, also when you do more card-not-present, you have the opportunity to deliver more services. When you deliver more services, it allows you to actually have a compensating effect from a revenue standpoint. So, I think those are two important things to keep in mind. The third, I would say, from an average ticket size standpoint, which impacts both cross-border and domestic, is what is the regional mix? Because different countries have different average ticket sizes, which influences what the growth rates are. Specifically on cross-border average ticket, it has been pretty stable year-over-year. And our assumption, as we kind of think about this is, not knowing perfectly well where inflation is going to go and the variables I kind of talked about, those are those things we factor into our assumptions as it relates to transaction growth on a going-forward basis.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take that question from Dave Koning at Baird.\nDave Koning: Maybe just to go back a little bit to Q1 guidance. You talked a little bit about this, but I know revenue you\u2019ve got on a non-GAAP basis decelerating something like 5% or so. But every metric -- every core metric in January accelerated by kind of 4% to 11%. Is there just tougher comps coming on some of those key metrics, or is it rebates? Or maybe talk through a little bit about the gap and kind of what\u2019s going to happen in the rest of the quarter.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Dave. A couple of thoughts. One, in Q1, acquisitions contribute less to our Q1 growth than they did to our Q4 growth because you\u2019re doing a sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1 in your question there. Number two, the suspension of operations in Russia has a greater impact in Q1 than it does in Q4. It\u2019s just the way the cadence of the revenues are. And then, two other points I\u2019d point out is Michael talked about the several wins we\u2019ve got -- active deal activity, which has been in play. We\u2019ve got to contemplate all of that in our Q1 kind of thoughts. And then, the last piece I\u2019d mention is we did have elevated levels of FX volatility in Q4. I don\u2019t know where FX volatility is going to play out. We\u2019ve done our best assumptions around that, but those would be the contributing factors.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Michael, any final comments?\nMichael Miebach: Yes. So, thanks for your questions. Thanks for your trust. Rayna, we will figure out your questions offline. We couldn\u2019t get to those, unfortunately. The day will come when there\u2019s a call where there\u2019s more questions for me than for Sachin. I\u2019m still hopeful. We will get there at some point. But the story has been resilient consumer, and we still see some opportunity in cross-border for Asia. That\u2019s the base. We\u2019re winning. That feels good as we look ahead into 2023. And we have 28,000 excited people at Mastercard that are going to deliver on that opportunity. With that, thank you very much and speak to you next quarter.\nSachin Mehra: Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning now to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 17%, supported by a resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 16%, which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 19% year-over-year to $2.65, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $590 million through January 23, 2023. So, let's turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV [Technical Difficulty] by 14%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 14%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 1%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 8% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 7%. Cross-border volume was up 31% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. Turning now to page 5. Switched transactions grew 8% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 18% year-over-year in Q4. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 56% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3.1 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's turn to page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide gross dollar volume grew 8%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 40%, while cross-border volumes increased 31%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 8%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 16%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our cyber & intelligence and data & services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 18%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving on to page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs. Turning to page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of January compared to Q4 2022. Each of these metrics, with the exception of cross-border card-not-present excluding travel, were favorably impacted by the lapping of the slower growth that occurred in January 2022 related to the Omicron variant. Switched volumes grew 21% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q4. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 4 ppt versus Q4. Overall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year, up 2 ppt from Q4. A couple of administrative notes, for your reference to help you understand the trends in the business, ex Russia, we have suspended -- where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from this schedule, if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. Additionally, as the impacts of the pandemic recede, going forward, we will no longer provide operating metric levels as a percentage of 2019. Turning now to page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. Let me start by saying that I believe that we are well positioned to address the significant growth opportunities at hand. We have established a clear set of strategic priorities and are making steady progress against each of them. This is evidenced by the many wins across the products and services Michael has discussed on this call and over time. On the macroeconomic front, as Michael laid out, we are monitoring a number of both, positive and negative factors. We do expect consumer spending to hold up relatively well in this environment, driven in part by the strong labor market. It is important to remember that we are coming off a year of strong growth as we lap the effects of the pandemic, and we expect our go-forward growth rates to moderate accordingly. From a cross-border travel standpoint, most regions have recovered and are well above 2019 levels in Q4. The exception is Asia, where there is still room to improve with China reopening. Just a little further context here. China represented about 1% of inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at approximately 20% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, China represented about 2% of outbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at about 50% of Q4 2019 levels. With this in mind, our base case scenario for the full year 2023 is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the euro relative to U.S. dollar. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to carefully manage our expenses as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of a high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 of a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind for the year. Turning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low-double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items and reflects generally resilient consumer spending. A couple of points to note. Q1 will be the last quarter in which we experience the lapping effect of our decision to suspend operations in Russia in Q1 of 2022. And we expect cross-border volume growth in Q1 2023 to be elevated as a result of the effects of Omicron in Q1 2022. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a high-single-digit rate versus a year-ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% in Q1 and 18% to 18.5% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Sure, Darrin. Good morning. So, let me provide you a little bit of color here. Look, I mean, what we've generally assumed in our base assumptions that I mentioned when I was delivering my prepared remarks is resilient consumer spending through 2023. I mean, we see a resilient consumer today, and we're seeing a generally resilient consumer spending pattern going forward in our base case. The other thing which we've contemplated, as we mentioned, from a cross-border standpoint, and particularly cross-border travel standpoint, the vast majority of the regions have now reached that state where they are kind of growing and growing at a healthy pace, but they're not growing at an accelerating pace. So, they've reached that level of stability. So, let me give you a little bit of color here. You'll remember as we are coming out of COVID, right, intra-Europe came back first cross-border standpoint. After that, we saw several inter markets come back from a cross-border standpoint, U.S., UK, Canada, Latin America, all of those. All of those are growing at a healthy pace, and we're assuming they'll continue to grow at a healthy pace but not at an accelerating pace. The one area where we are assuming an increase in terms of growth is around Asia Pacific. I mean, Asia Pacific has been a lagger in terms of recovery of cross-border travel. And we're expecting that there will be -- with the borders recently opening in several markets in AP that there will be some level of recovery, which will come through there when you index back to 2019. So, that's kind of generally been the base case we've kind of assumed. Look, I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, I think that the reality is we've got things which are helping us from a share win standpoint. We've got strong consumer spending, our services capabilities continuing to grow at a healthy pace, all of that is built into our guide as we go forward. Also remember that in 2022, we did have elevated levels of FX volatility which were there in the market, which actually supported the growth rate which we had in 2022. It's hard to predict, but that looks like on a going-forward basis, we do our best assumptions on that from an FX volatility standpoint. But that's kind of the building blocks as to how we've gone about building our business. The last point I'll make is around rebates and incentives, you asked the question. As you can see, quarter-over-quarter, [ph] we talk about how we are delivering wins. We are winning with new customers. We are expanding our business with existing customers. So, we are building in assumptions from a rebates and incentive standpoint, which will be consistent with what you're seeing in our track record from a winning standpoint as it relates to us. And Lisa, maybe I can just add a little bit out here, particularly as you think about the virtual card opportunity, which Mike just talked about. The differentiation, which is provided by technology which is what Michael talked about by virtue of the acquisition, which we had with our virtual card capabilities, but there's also differentiation in terms of our approach from a go-to-market standpoint. And specifically, when you target flows from a go-to-market standpoint, you go on a vertical-by-vertical basis. So, as you know, we've been very successful in the travel vertical. Part of the reason we've been successful in the travel vertical is having a deep understanding of what it takes at the travel integrator level to be able to embed your technology there so that you are the payment choice, which people will exercise when they have to make those payments. Similarly, as we look at that opportunity going forward, there are several other verticals we're making the similar kinds of advances in. So, that's specific as it relates to the BCN piece. But you also asked about small business and the commercial point-of-sale opportunity, which is there. And the reality is we've been winning significant new deals in that small business opportunity. And we see, candidly, a very sizable market opportunity in commercial point of sale, a large part of that is still in cash and check. And the reality is, just like we did in B2M where we displace cash and check utilizing digital technologies and innovation, that's kind of the advances we're making also in commercial point of sale. So, that's how we kind of see and frame the opportunity set across both of these areas. Sure, Tien-Tsin. So, on your question around revenue, it's like I laid out, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we put our base case together. We've kind of laid out what our assumptions are from a base case standpoint. And at the end of the day, we don't have the crystal ball to actually suggest that that is the way things are going to play out. But based on everything we're seeing in the nature of current trends as well as leading indicators, particularly as it relates to the overall strength of the labor market, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing from a base case standpoint as it relates to the outlook for revenues. As it relates to one component of revenues, which we oftentimes think about is around -- on an as-reported basis versus what it is on a currency-neutral basis, very hard to predict where foreign exchange markets go. But again, we've seen recent strengthening of the euro take place, and that's what we've kind of shared with you in terms of our assumptions from an FX standpoint. And then, you asked about operating leverage. Look, I mean, the reality is we've always operated with the philosophy of delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. We look at the top line. We look at how our expense is up also against that top line. We have, in the past, demonstrated our capability to modulate our expenses to the extent we start to see adverse impacts take place on the top line and vice versa. And the reality is what we don't want to do is impact the long-term growth potential of our business. So, we will continue to invest in our business with our eye on the long term. We will be prudent about not going into spaces from an OpEx standpoint, which are not in demand. Obviously, I'm kind of stating the obvious here. But the reality is the philosophy remains unchanged. We will look to deliver positive operating leverage as a company. And we have the tools and the ability to actually modulate expenses if top line -- if we feel like the top line growth is going to get impacted over the long term. Sure. So Sanjay, let me share a few thoughts on how we think about cross-border, right? So at the end of the day, there are numerous things which impact how people travel and spend in the cross-border environment. But at the outset, what I want to say is that the fundamentals around the cross-border proposition as delivered by Mastercard actually stand to be very sound just like they were in the pre-pandemic days. We said this through the pandemic, and it's played out in that manner. Now, let me get a little bit more specific as it relates to pent-up demand -- your question around pent-up demand. The reality is we all know from what we hear on the earnings calls of airlines that capacity is constrained from an airline standpoint. And with that constrained capacity and elevated prices, you're seeing that impact come through when you do P times Q, which is price multiplied by quantity, you get kind of what the resultant impact from a spend standpoint is. Fast forward, as capacity comes back online, one would expect that people will -- there will be some level of adjustment in prices because the demand-supply equation gets a little bit more in equilibrium. And so overall, we're not assuming that that necessarily results in a tailwind because capacity comes back online, right, because there's going to be an adjustment which takes place from a price standpoint. Our view -- again, we hope we're wrong, and we hope cross-border spending kind of goes with more capacity, prices remain elevated and people continue to spend, but we've got to take a point of view on that, and that's what we're taking. The other point I'll make is, as it relates to what the impact of FX rates is on cross-border and cross-border travel. The reality is what we've seen historically is that when exchange rates move, for example, with the dollar strengthening, with the lag effect, you would tend to see inbound into the U.S. get impacted. That's only natural. It gets more expensive for people coming from different parts of the globe to come into the U.S. But what we've also seen is individual extend to then redirect that cross-border spend to other parts of the globe where they don't feel the impact of that come through. So, movements in foreign exchange rates, does have an impact on how we think about cross-border going forward. Sure. So first, Jason, I'm not going to share specifics as it relates to how we built our model up for the full year. What I will share with you is as it relates to the recovery of both inbound and outbound for China, we have built in some level of recovery as the year progresses. It's our best estimate as to what we expect to happen by virtue of the borders opening and the quantity and requirements being lifted. But suffice it to say that the opportunity is pretty sizable. The fact that we were in Q4 at 20% of 2019 levels from an inbound travel standpoint, cross-border travel standpoint is just suggestive of the fact that if you just think about what's gone on around the regions and how they've recovered and bounced right back and gone well above 2019 levels, there's a significant opportunity both on inbound and outbound as it relates to China. And sorry, the second part of your question, Jason? Again, I mean, when you -- the strategic priorities, we've got payment services in new networks, as Michael has talked about. Look, I mean, I'll give you a general sense. I mean, you know about -- from a payment standpoint, we've been doing this, and we've been doing this for many decades, and that is the substantive part of how we deliver our revenue growth. Over the last decade, we've shown you how services have grown and still growing at a healthy pace. In my view, the demand for our services capability still remains very strong. You've seen that we've been growing at a faster pace in services relative to the overall growth of our business. And I don't think we should assume anything different on a going-forward basis. And new networks is relatively nascent really. So again, I would put that into the space of it's growing. It's growing off a small base at a very healthy clip. But the reality is on the overall Mastercard, it's still to have a meaningful impact. So, that's kind of the best I can share with you on that. All right, Will. So, I'll take your questions in order out here. You talked about some color around how we're seeing things shape up in Q4 relative to 2019 levels. We're seeing pretty stable levels as it relates to switched volumes, switched transactions in cross-border, in fact, marginally up on each one of them quarter-over-quarter. So for example, in switched volumes in Q3 as a percentage of 2019, we were running at 154%; in Q4, we were running at 156%. And you can see this in the slide deck, which we shared with you. The one thing to just keep in mind is in the U.S. in Q4, we have seen a little bit of an impact come through from lower gas prices, and that's kind of being reflected in the numbers you see right here. You asked a question from a regional color standpoint. I'd say there's remarkably consistent growth that we're seeing in most regions. For example, in Europe, Europe continues hold up pretty well. Latin America and EMEA are also actually holding up pretty well from a growth standpoint. In Q4, China was in the negative, particularly in its domestic volumes. And again, remember, our -- we don't generate a lot of revenue from the domestic side. But, it was impacted negatively because of the flareup in the COVID situation, which took place there. So that's one piece to keep in mind. Another piece to keep in mind is that from an India standpoint, we are -- now that we're out of the embargo and we've started new issuance, you still have the tail effect of the embargo coming through. So said differently, the fact that you actually for a year were not issuing new cards in India has a resultant impact of attrition of old cards which are taking place, which need to be more than compensated for by issuance of new cards. And that takes time as issuers get ramped up and ready to go. So, you've seen that come through in Q4 as well. But beyond that, I would say that we continue to see pretty good and consistent growth relative to 2019 levels across all our metrics here. And, Will, you had asked the question about China. In my prepared remarks, I shared with you that China inbound cross-border travel pre-pandemic was roughly 1% of our total corresponding volumes, and our outbound -- the similar metric from an outbound standpoint was about 2%. So, I know that was the second part of your question. And I'll just add, David, to Michael's point around the deals which we've recently won and announced. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, we had talked about Santander historically. That migration is in progress. And we're through the bulk of a 9 million card migration there. We expect to be complete by early 2023 on that one. NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard debit cards in December of 2021. That's well underway, and we would expect some of that to continue to happen in 2023. And then, the other one we had spoken about historically was Deutsche Bank, and we expect that the migration of one will commence somewhere in the middle of 2023. So, just to give you a little bit of sense as to how we're kind of thinking about things. I'm going to need a little bit more clarity on the second part of your question, but we'll get to that. Let me take the first question first, which is as it relates to the growth algorithm. Just suffice it to say that the fundamentals of our business actually are very, very sound. The growth algorithm, which has actually enabled the strong growth we have delivered pre-pandemic, very much stands sound even today. So, the reality is, if you think about PCE growth, you think about the opportunity for the secular shift to electronic forms of payment, you think about the fact that we're growing market share, you think about how we're delivering on our services capabilities and driving growth from that, and now as we're doing new and different things around new payment flows as well as new networks, that growth algorithm actually is very sound, very stable, very consistent with what we've historically had. And that's the way we think about the business for, call it, not only the near term but near medium to long term for Mastercard. Now, Ashwin, I'm not sure I got the second part of your question. Could you repeat that, please? Yes. Look, I mean, our cross-border proposition sound -- is very sound and stable. And I think at the end of the day, like I said, most of the regions are now back to what I would call, the stable growth rates that we would normally have seen in the pre-pandemic phase. The one exception is Asia, and there's a little bit of opportunity which we have in Asia, which we've contemplated in our thoughts for 2023. Sure, Ken. So my comment is actually going to hold true for not only cross-border for -- largely for the business, if you think about it, right? You know our transactions or the growth in our transactions is impacted by our average ticket size. There are puts and takes on the average ticket size, not only in cross-border but even on domestic, which are influenced by numerous factors, one of which is inflation. The others are the mix between card-present and card-not-present. Because what happens is, typically, with more card-not-present, you tend to see a higher average ticket size, which results in lower transaction growth rate. Now, that being said, also when you do more card-not-present, you have the opportunity to deliver more services. When you deliver more services, it allows you to actually have a compensating effect from a revenue standpoint. So, I think those are two important things to keep in mind. The third, I would say, from an average ticket size standpoint, which impacts both cross-border and domestic, is what is the regional mix? Because different countries have different average ticket sizes, which influences what the growth rates are. Specifically on cross-border average ticket, it has been pretty stable year-over-year. And our assumption, as we kind of think about this is, not knowing perfectly well where inflation is going to go and the variables I kind of talked about, those are those things we factor into our assumptions as it relates to transaction growth on a going-forward basis. Sure, Dave. A couple of thoughts. One, in Q1, acquisitions contribute less to our Q1 growth than they did to our Q4 growth because you're doing a sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1 in your question there. Number two, the suspension of operations in Russia has a greater impact in Q1 than it does in Q4. It's just the way the cadence of the revenues are. And then, two other points I'd point out is Michael talked about the several wins we've got -- active deal activity, which has been in play. We've got to contemplate all of that in our Q1 kind of thoughts. And then, the last piece I'd mention is we did have elevated levels of FX volatility in Q4. I don't know where FX volatility is going to play out. We've done our best assumptions around that, but those would be the contributing factors. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Let's get right into it. So, starting with the big picture. Consumer spending has remained resilient, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. We closed out the year with strong financial results and several notable wins. Quarter four net revenues were up 17% and adjusted operating income up 19%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items. While the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we are keeping a close eye on a variety of positive and negative factors. The broadly resilient labor market with low unemployment and rising wages, coupled with elevated consumer savings levels, are key drivers of consumer spending. We're also tracking efforts by the central banks to curb inflation, along with moderating energy prices and the reopening of China. So, still lots of moving pieces. From an overall consumer spending standpoint, we expect the consumer to be relatively resilient. Spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China. In terms of switched volumes, domestic volumes in the fourth quarter remained steady relative to 2019 levels with some slight moderation in the U.S. related to lower gas prices recently. Cross-border travel continued to recover in quarter four with inbound travel either flat or up in every region sequentially relative to 2019 levels. As of the first three weeks of January, inbound cross-border travel to all regions is now above 2019 levels. We will continue to monitor the economic environment closely, and should the outlook change, we're prepared to move quickly to adjust our spending levels as we have done in the past. In the meantime, we continue to focus on the things we can control. This starts with our three strategic priorities: expanding in payments; extending our services; and embracing new networks. And here are some examples of how we're progressing against each of these. Starting with payments. We won substantial new business this quarter. Our innovative products, differentiated services and partnership approach enabled us to secure major portfolio flips, extend relationships and launch new programs with banks, co-brand partners and transit systems around the world. I am very excited about our expanded partnership with Citizens to become their exclusive payments provider across all product portfolios in the United States. We will shift their debit portfolio to Mastercard, and we will maintain exclusivity on credit and commercial. Citizens selected Mastercard based on our digital assets, open banking capabilities and safety and security tools. We have also extended and enhanced our long-term partnership with Citi. It solidifies Mastercard as Citi's exclusive global partner for Citi-branded consumer credit, debit and small business cards. We look forward to continuing to partner to deliver digital initiatives, new technologies and innovative payment solutions together. We've extended our longstanding relationship with Bank of America across their consumer and small business debit and credit lines of business. They're great partners. We're especially proud to continue as the lead brand for all newly issued small business cards. And our positive momentum with Chase continued this quarter as well. Building up on our recent co-brand, commercial and Pay-by-Bank partnership announcements, we are excited to announce that we have renewed the Chase Freedom Flex portfolio. Turning to the UK, we recently extended our credit deal with NatWest Group for consumer and commercial. We're partnering with Belbim, [ph] Istanbul transportation to convert over 17 million closed-loop cards, Mastercards and add 24,000 new acceptance locations across the city. We've partnered with QNB Finansbank and Trendyol, a large e-commerce marketplace in Turkey, over 30 million customers to launch a new Mastercard co-brand credit product. Now, an important driver of our success in core payments is our ability to deliver innovation and thought leadership. We are designing and deploying innovation solutions at scale, as a result, are the clear partner of choice for our customers. Three recent examples include our work in Installments, Tokenization and Click to Pay. Starting off with installments. SoFi launched Pay in 4, becoming the first bank in the U.S. to launch within the Mastercard Installments program. SoFi valued the broad acceptance, strong consumer protections and commission-based open banking capabilities that all make Mastercard Installments unique. We've got a strong pipeline for Mastercard Installments and plan to add several additional programs across multiple regions throughout the year. Turning to Tokenization. We surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions per month and for the year, we are up 38%. We're currently enabling digital transactions in over 110 countries. Tokenization helps keep the ecosystem safe and secure across a wide range of use cases. One example that I think is particularly cool is the work we are doing with in-car payments. We're working with car manufacturers and fintechs to integrate payments using our tokenization platform and biometric authentication capabilities. Think about the simplicity it brings to paying for gas, tolls, charging or entertainment right from your car. This is a great example of Mastercard working with partners to drive the convergence of the Internet of Things, 5G and addressing consumer demand for cool digital experiences. It also highlights how we're expanding the reach and the value of our acceptance network through new channels to support new use cases. This is just the beginning. Watch for more to come in the space. And on Click to Pay, we partnered with Adyen to launch Click to Pay on their global payment platform, recognizing the value that it brings to guest checkouts and millions of online shoppers. Adyen joins more than 20 other payment service providers around the world, bringing Click to Pay to thousands of merchants globally. Now this focus on innovation and partnership is also a critical part of our strategy to penetrate the prioritized set of new flows that we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day. We continue to make solid progress. Here are some of examples how we're driving growth in each area. First, disbursements and remittances. Mastercard Send and our cross-border services capabilities are solving for an expanding set of use cases across multiple geographies. For example, we partnered with social marketplace platform, Poshmark, to enable seller payouts. And for cross-border payments, we've teamed up with Paysend to broaden our global reach and expand the ability to send international payments across card brands. Second, we're deploying digital capabilities to displace cash and check-based commercial payments at the point of sale, huge opportunity. In France, we signed an agreement with Socie\u0301te\u0301 Ge\u0301ne\u0301rale to develop their corporate card book. And in South Korea, we partnered with KakaoBank and Samsung Card to launch new debit and credit co-brand offerings for small businesses. The third flow is B2B accounts payable payments. Our virtual card capabilities provide an effective digital solution to address the working capital, process efficiency and data challenges that are prevalent in B2B. We are a global leader in virtual card. We're seeing rapid growth in this space. We're bolstering our position through new partnerships and capabilities. For example, we announced plans to partner with Sabre and confirm our pay to accelerate the use of virtual cards for B2B travel payments. We also signed an agreement with fintech partner, Extenet, to offer virtual mobile corporate cards in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, on the consumer bill payment front, we are focused on deploying market-specific solutions to meet unique needs of consumers and businesses. For example, in Norway, we are powering the eFaktura service, which is used by the vast majority of citizens to pay their bills. In 2022, we hit a milestone as over 200 million digital invoices were sent using eFaktura. As you can see, we're making significant progress expanding in payments, and we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. Now turning to the second of our three strategic priorities, services. Services provide differentiation and diversification for Mastercard. Our strategy is to leverage our services to drive growth at the core and to expand into new segments and use cases. We're making steady progress on both and have significant opportunity for future growth. Our services continue to drive growth in the core as evidenced by our wins and extensions with Citizens, Citi, NatWest and others, as I mentioned earlier. One example of a service that enhances the value of payments is Consumer Clarity. The service provides cardholders with merchant details in digital receipts to reduce disputes, low charge-back costs and improve the consumer experience. We recently partnered with TSYS who will offer Consumer Clarity to over 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the UK. In 2022, we signed up over 50 financial institutions and merchant partners for Consumer Clarity, including large issuers like Itau\u0301 in Brazil. We're also expanding our services to new segments and new use cases, including governments, retailers, digital partners and financial institutions. This quarter, we partnered with research and consulting firms, including EFO and SEMA [ph] in Germany, as well as the Barbados Ministry of Tourism and International Transport to provide governments with detailed insights into tourism and retail spending trends. We engage with retailers like Lowe's who are leveraging our Test & Learn capabilities to conduct analytics on their core business. We partner with large fintechs like Monzo in the UK. to advise on product development strategies. And we are deploying our personalization solutions, which we acquired through Dynamic Yield, across a range of retail and financial institutions, including Carrefour, Argentina, Height, [indiscernible] to enhance and scale their personalization efforts. I'm very encouraged by the continued momentum in our services growth strategy and the differentiation and diversification that these capabilities bring. I'll now move on to our third strategic priority, which is embracing new networks, namely open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I'd like to highlight an example of how our open banking capabilities have come together with our other strategic priorities to offer a new solution. As I mentioned earlier, in quarter four, JPMorgan Payments and Mastercard announced an innovative Pay-by-Bank solution. Solution utilizes the MasterCard open banking platform to modernize existing ACH payments and allow customers to pay bills from their bank account in a frictionless manner. Pay-by-Bank offers choice and provides a simple and secure experience of billers and merchants as well as consumers by enhancing existing ACH transactions. This deal is a manifestation of our multi-rail strategy, expands our addressable market by our open banking capabilities, and it deepens our relationship with JPMorgan Chase. We're actively working with them to take the solution to market this year. We also continue to make our progress with open banking in Europe. Mastercard is connected to more than 3,000 banks and financial institutions across 18 markets to power their open banking efforts. This quarter, we partnered with Secure Trust Bank in the UK, who will leverage our open banking capabilities to provide safe and convenient ways for their customers to repay retail loans directly from their bank account. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and the continued recovery in cross-border travel. In payments, we won substantial new business this quarter, including Citizens. We're expanding our differentiated services and embracing new networks, including leveraging our open banking capabilities to power solutions, like JPMorgan's Pay-by-Bank. With all that, we're well positioned for the opportunities ahead. We will manage the business with agility, should the macroeconomic outlook change. Sachin, over to you. Right. Harshita, let me start off on that. So, the way we think about this is in the end, it is about delivering choice to consumers, choice of merchants, choice to banks, and we are therefore in all relevant ways to pay. But it's also true that the card ecosystem over the years has driven tremendous value. So, it is a prevalent way to pay for many, many use cases. But on the side, we have alternative payment methods emerging. And we look at those as options to go after new use cases, and that's exactly what happened here in the context of our partnership with JPMorgan. This is focused on existing ACH payments, which are not bringing the value to the biller or the consumer that they are looking for. Frankly, though, very specifically, what we're doing here, the issue with some of these account-to-account payments is you never really know what balance is on the account. And our open banking capabilities are really providing a payment success factor here that tells the biller this is a good time to debit this particular account, so true value brought that somebody is willing to pay for, in this case, the biller/the merchant. So, a good example of where there can be value created an alternative payment tools while this doesn't take away from the power the cards are bringing to consumers and merchants. So, we see this as coexistence. Where this is going over time, we don't quite know, but our multi-rail strategy positions us well to play in either field. Right, Lisa. So, the opportunity here lies really in taking our existing set of tools, namely from the card ecosystem, very specifically the virtual card capability, which came through an acquisition many, many years ago that we've now built out -- ourselves into the leader here. So this existing set of tools and a huge opportunity in terms of flows to be addressed and make them more efficient, we're looking at $14 trillion from an opportunity perspective. If you recall what we laid out across the 4 flows, new flows, this is the -- one of the large ones here that we quoted. And the way to go about this is really to say, all right, who are the different players that we already have in our ecosystem. We bring BCNs in too. There's a lot of deals with financial institutions, but there's also a lot of deals with partners out in the travel space, and the travel space is really the one that's been most promising for us, and that is coming back right now. So this is a near-term opportunity. Cash and checks dominated existing tools, existing partners. This is right for us to go after it, and we're leaning in. You can hear it. It helps you have a CFO that used to be the head of our Commercial Products. And just to add one point here, Sanjay, that is over the last two years, we've been winning portfolios in the space. We've really focused on the space, expecting to come back. If you recall, let me just remind everybody here, across airlines, across travel, our online travel agencies, across lodging, across other forms of transports like trains, Myriad, Virgin Atlantic, Amtrak, JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and so forth, we have won portfolios. And we've bolstered that in terms of market access through these partners with additional products. So there's Mastercard Travel Rewards out there, which is now in 80 countries. So, we believe into the macroeconomic environment that Sachin just laid out, we have the better proposition. So, it remains an exciting space. The pace in which we'll grow, we'll have to see that is characterized by what Sachin just said, but we certainly have a differentiated proposition in that. And one last comment I want to make, Sanjay, I'm happy you're excited about metrics and how we're changing the metrics. From a metrics perspective, I want to complete -- back to Lisa's question earlier. I mentioned the $14 trillion on commercial POS, but there's also $24 trillion on accounts payable, which makes the total opportunity in this combined space, $38 trillion. So, that conversation earlier was an important one on a very big part of our priorities. Jason, I'd say the model really is one not of separate pillars. This is an integrated business proposition where services differentiates payments. And payments is oftentimes a way to build out a further -- a broader set of services and so forth. So, it kind of goes in the circle -- a virtuous circle, I have to say. When you look at it, the -- historically, we gave you a number a couple of years ago that service is a third of our quarter. It has been growing faster. I gave you an example earlier in my prepared remarks on Consumer Clarity, which is something that is transaction-related, and it's growing faster with 50 new issuers. So, there's just a lot of momentum in there. But, there is also the kind of services that are not related to the underlying payments business. For example, what the example I gave you on Test & Learn, where we're working with a set of customers to work on their base core business as in Lowe's, the example that I gave you. So, different sets of dynamics, but they go hand in hand, and that is the power of the differentiated and diversified business model that we have. And a step down compared to last year and the year before is, of course, there because you get the mathematics and the lapping effects and so forth. But to 2019, I think that's an instructive view here. And it tells us that, yes, we're expecting a resilient consumer will continue to spend. David, let me start off on that. So, looking at Europe really in three categories, there's the UK on one hand and there's emerging Europe and then there is Continental Central Europe, and slightly different picture on all of them. First of all, starting off with the continent. Here, the concern has been around for a while on rising gas prices and energy prices and the impact on the consumers' ability to spend. A combination of fiscal measures to provide cushions to consumers, along with energy-saving measures, along with the gas storage now reaching full capacity has really alleviated some of these concerns. So, we continue to see a fairly resilient European consumer. That's our base assumption as we look forward. UK, somewhat different economic outlook, and that might be a little more shaky there. But fundamentally, in this market, we are seeing a lot of tailwind for us from share gains over the last couple of years. So that works well for us. And emerging Europe continues to be a dramatic digitization opportunity as we've seen in markets like Russia, which unfortunately is not in our P&L any longer. But we have seen very high digitization rates, and we're pushing that in these more emerging markets. Somewhere between, there's peculiarities like Germany, where there was a significant digitization opportunity, and there still remains. But we caught up a lot in Germany over the last two years, particularly on the contactless side, which is now reaching half of the transactions there. So, healthy mix in Europe and very strong share position with opportunities to come through from portfolio wins that we have shared with you over the last couple of years as they go into effect. Yes. So, thanks for your questions. Thanks for your trust. Rayna, we will figure out your questions offline. We couldn't get to those, unfortunately. The day will come when there's a call where there's more questions for me than for Sachin. I'm still hopeful. We will get there at some point. But the story has been resilient consumer, and we still see some opportunity in cross-border for Asia. That's the base. We're winning. That feels good as we look ahead into 2023. And we have 28,000 excited people at Mastercard that are going to deliver on that opportunity. With that, thank you very much and speak to you next quarter."

Let\u2019s get right into it. The headline is that consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover. With this backdrop, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth through the focused execution of our strategy. Third quarter net revenues were up 23% and adjusted operating income up 27%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.  The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. Inflationary pressures have remained elevated and central banks are continuing to take aggressive steps to bring inflation in line. Tensions remain high with the war in Ukraine and the supply of natural gas to Europe is a concern. Despite all of this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising, consumer savings levels remain elevated, and credit is readily accessible. In this setting, overall consumer spending has remained resilient, although we are seeing some shift in what consumers are buying.  Looking at our switch volume trends, domestic volumes remain steady, showing growth relative to 2019 levels, relatively consistent to the second quarter 2022. The trend towards spending on experiences continues. We saw notable strength in airlines, lodging and restaurant spend with a shift away from categories like home furnishings and appliances. The current mix between retail T&E and other categories of spend is now broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. Cross-border continues to recover as border restrictions are progressively relaxed. Cross-border travel in the third quarter has reached 124% of 2019 levels. Relative to 2019 levels, most regions are up sequentially, including a notable improvement in Asia. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to hold up well.   Notwithstanding the continued strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely, including fiscal, monetary and other policy actions taken in response to events. This will inform our actions, as it always has. Should the market outlook weaken, we are prepared to act quickly to modulate our expenses. As we demonstrated during the pandemic, we have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers and will do so while maintaining focus on our three key strategic priorities. The focus on these areas will create new opportunities for growth. It starts by solidifying our positions in payments complemented by our differentiated services line and our expansion into adjacent activities like open banking and digital identity. Moving onto some examples of how we are progressing against each of these, first we are expanding in payments by enabling digital transformation with our customers, [indiscernible] volume growth, expanding acceptance, and capturing new payment flows. There are now over 3 billion Mastercards in circulation supported in part by programs such as our Digital First initiative.  Our Digital First solution starts with the ability for a consumer to acquire and then use a new card digitally in real time. It\u2019s helping customers create a best-in-class digital experience leading to increased approval rates on average by two percentage points, reduce fraud on average by four basis points, and increase spend per active account on average by 10%. To date, we have launched over 200 Digital First customers around the globe. Santander in Mexico, Chase in the U.K., Citibanamex, ING in Spain, and Nubank in Brazil are amongst the latest customers to partner with Mastercard to deliver and end-to-end Digital First customer journey. Also, we\u2019re driving growth in volume with new and renewed wins across a broad set of partners. In the U.S., we recently extended our exclusive deal with Keybanc for debit, credit, commercial and small business, as well as deepened our relationship on services. This quarter in partnership with Chase, we will launch a new co-run program with DoorDash. This deal further expands our presence in the digital food delivery space. We also went live with the Uber Pro Card, an enhanced loyalty and payments experience that will help drivers in Korea save on gas, fees and other expenses. In Europe, we have seen momentum in Italy with [indiscernible] securing an expanded deal that includes a credit and prepaid flip, as well as securing the current Mastercard portfolio. In Latin America, we have renewed our exclusivity agreement with Mercado Libre and secured incremental credit share with Banco Scotiabank Colpatria. Overall, another great quarter with notable wins.  Let\u2019s shift to one area that is sometimes underappreciated, that is how we are enabling growth in payments by giving people and businesses more places to use their Mastercard. We have added more acceptance locations in the last five years than the previous 50, and we are now accepted at more than 90 million merchant locations.  The preference for contactless payments that grew over the last two years continues. More than half of the in-person switch purchase transactions are now tapped, up from approximately one-third pre-pandemic, and this trend will be bolstered by the adoption of new technologies such as tap on phone.  Further, our technology and global reach enabled growth in acceptance while helping our partners drive their digital strategies. For example, we have signed with McDonald\u2019s to use our gateway capabilities enabling them to easily offer more solutions to new markets, beginning in Middle East and Africa.  Finally, we\u2019re driving growth in payments by leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. We continue to make progress in going after flows in the disbursements and remittances space by expanding into new use cases and geographies. For example, in the U.S. gig economy, we\u2019ve signed a new global agreement with AirBnB to facilitate host payouts using Mastercard Send in select markets.  We have also expanded with gaming payouts, launching our Gaming Fast payout program. To address [indiscernible] account exported domestic payments, we have signed a deal with Pagero, a leading global B2B network and solutions provider that provides account payable automation to some of the world\u2019s largest corporate brands.  We\u2019re also growing commercial point-of-sale transactions by targeting small business, corporate T&E, purchasing and fleet flows. In the U.S., we announced our exclusive co-brand partnership with First National Bank of Omaha to issue the [indiscernible] small business card. This product offers small business owners industry-leading access to tools, benefits and services with a focus on equitable access to credit - very important.  We also continue to target B2B accounts payable flows by expanding access and reach leveraging our virtual card capabilities. We signed a deal with Marqueta to enable our next generation virtual card solution, Instant Pay. This solution intelligently and automatically sends instant payments to suppliers. We have also signed an agreement with SAP Taulia to integrate our virtual card solutions into Taulia and their SAP solutions, enabling their customers to facilitate virtual card payments.  We\u2019re also well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel with our Mastercard wholesale travel program. In Bahrain, we signed a deal with Infinios travel agency and travel management company volumes, and in Europe, we signed a deal with a fintech, Swile, while going after B2B travel flows in Europe and Latin America. As you can see, we continue to make steady progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows. Now turning to services, where we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth, our services delivered a diversified revenue stream for Mastercard beyond payments. They accomplished this by adding new service capabilities as well as extending existing service offerings into new and existing customers. There continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity in this space. First off, we\u2019re excited about dynamic yield\u2019s unique personalization platform which offers a great example of how we\u2019re adding new service capabilities. Since complementing the acquisition earlier this year, we have added dozens of new retail and commerce customers. A great example is [indiscernible], a German fashion store. I always share German examples if I can. They have more than 1,400 stores in Europe. We have deployed our content personalization capabilities to additional markets. In addition, we are expanding our capabilities to financial institutions.  Now, beyond adding new services, there\u2019s an opportunity for over-extending existing offerings into new and existing customers. In the third quarter, we signed an agreement with Sky Italia, part of Sky Group, one of Europe\u2019s leading media and entertainment companies, to enrich and commercialize a new service to support small businesses. mBurse, a technology provider to insurance companies is implementing our card link services for their micro savings program with Generali Insurance in Switzerland, and in Spain we have grown our relationship with Caxiabank with one of our largest European [indiscernible] deals. The deal enables them to provide a more efficient charge-back flow for all their card portfolios. Beyond expanding in payments and extending our services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks. As a reminder, our current focus is on two areas: open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I\u2019ll touch on open banking. While open banking is early in the game, it is a tremendous opportunity. We are engaged with a broad set of financial institutions and fintechs who are increasingly interested in a wide range of use cases. What\u2019s unique and interesting here is that we are the partner that brings what is needed to scale and instill confidence in the space, things like responsible data practices, consumer protections, and deep compliance, all on top of our robust technical capabilities, broad connectivity and extensive applications. Just to give you a flavor, in the U.S. Quicken, a leading provider of financial management solutions, has selected Mastercard as their provider of consumer permission data for its popular Simplify budgeting platform. We\u2019re also working with Fidelity to support their innovation in student loan repayment for organizations that want to help their employees improve their financial wellness. Then there\u2019s Jack Henry, which will enable community and regional financial institutions to be at the center of their account holders\u2019 financial lives. They will do this providing stability to securely see all of their financial accounts within and outside a primary financial institution in a single view. This will help enable consumers and businesses to make more informed financial decisions. This is just the beginning and much more to come in open banking. Before wrapping up, I\u2019d like to share an example of how we are incorporating our capabilities across all three strategic pillars. Our strategy to engage in the crypto economy leverages assets across payments, services, and new networks, a combination that yields a truly differentiated value proposition. Here, we\u2019re deploying our payment capabilities to enable consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and cash out their crypto wallets via Mastercard Send. This quarter, we partnered with Evonax, who will become our first partner in Australia to issue crypto-funded cards. We\u2019re enabling off-ramp solutions with Mastercard Send and recently added five new players in North America and Europe, including finance supported by checkout.com and Nubay. In all instances, we do not handle crypto but rather take delivery of fiat currency. Our services and new networks capabilities are providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants. Crypto Secure is an innovative solution designed to bring additional security and trust to this digital ecosystem by helping card issuers address regulatory risks. We also recognize the interest people continue to have in buying and holding crypto through trusted places like the banks, so last week we announced Crypto Source, which is designed to give our financial institution partners access to a comprehensive suite of buy, hold and sell services for select crypto assets. This will be augmented with our proven identity, cyber security and advisory services. To support these upcoming pilot programs, Mastercard is expanding its partnership with Paxos Trust Company to leverage their crypto asset trading and custody services. As you can see, our crypto strategy is bringing together best-in-class capabilities at scale all built on our core principles of providing strong consumer protections, safety and security.  In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth aided by a resilient consumer and a continued recovery in cross-border travel. We continue executing against our three strategic priorities. We have strong momentum with our customers, offering a diverse set of innovative solutions. We will continue to manage our expenses carefully within this macroeconomic environment, and our well diversified and flexible business model positions us well for the future. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 23% supported by resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 PPT to this growth.  Operating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 PPT increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 27%, which includes a 1 PPT decrease related to acquisitions.  EPS was up 22% year-over-year to $2.68, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $505 million through October 24, 2022.  Let\u2019s turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV increased by 11% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 18%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 20%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 2%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of the previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%.  Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12% with credit growth of 15% and debit growth of 9%. Cross-border volume was up 44% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.  Turning to Page 5, switch transactions grew 9% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switch transactions grew 19% year-over-year in Q3. Card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 54% of all in person switch purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 10% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  Now let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 23% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 PPT to this growth.  Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 9% while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57% while cross-border volumes increased 44%. The 13 PPT difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross border volumes this quarter.  Transaction processing fees were up 22% while switch transaction grew 9%. The 13 PPT difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues, and pricing.  Other revenues were up 22%, including a 2 PPT contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our cyber intelligence and data services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 26% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving onto Page 7, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, total adjusted operating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 PPT impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.  Turning now to Page 8, let\u2019s discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of October. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in the stack which shows all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russia-issued cards from prior periods. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in October. As expected, the year-over-year growth metrics faced tougher comps as we began lapping periods in 2021 when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound. However, it is important to note that all metrics continue to hold up well relative to 2019 levels. Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switch volumes, for the first three weeks of October we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 PPT versus Q3. Switch transactions grew 9% year-over-year through the first three weeks of October, consistent with Q3. As a reminder, Russia has a relatively low average ticket size which results in a larger relative impact to this metric.  Overall, cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of October grew 36% year-over-year, down 8 PPT versus Q3. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as border restrictions continued to be lifted. In the first three weeks of October, cross-border travel was up 62% year-over-year, down 11 PPT versus Q3 due to more difficult year-ago comps, as I just noted. Cross-border travel is now at 125% of 2019 levels, up 1 PPT from Q3 levels.  Cross-border card not present excluding travel was up 12% year-over-year in October, which includes the impact of significant ecommerce promotional activities and is down 1 PPT from Q3. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.  Turning to Page 9, I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. Let me begin by saying that the execution of our strategic priorities is translating into expanded and deeper customer relationships and the broader adoption of our material solutions and differentiated services. Consumer spending remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and cross-border travel continues to recover as border restrictions ease and consumers shift their spending back towards travel. Just to update you on some metrics we are tracking, Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel pre-pandemic in 2019, is at approximately 76% of 2019 levels in Q3, up from about 60% in Q2. We continue to believe there is more room to grow as several travel corridors, particularly in Asia, still remain restricted and airline industry capacity continues to build back up. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel arrangement portfolios and services offerings, including access to an extensive airport lounge network and concierge services and our global Mastercard Travel Rewards program, which allows issuers and merchants to connect to provide consumers with unique benefits through a simple digital experience. As we have laid out, there are a number of factors that could influence future economic growth. These include elevated inflation and rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions balanced against low unemployment, rising wages, and high savings levels in particular. We are monitoring each of these and, as Michael just said, we are prepared to act quickly to adjust our expenses to reflect any meaningful change to top line growth. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the high end of the mid-teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This is consistent with prior expectations and sequentially reflects, one, generally resilient consumer spending relative to 2019 levels; two, stable to slightly improved cross-border travel growth relative to 2019 levels with some continued improvement into Asia and some moderation within Europe; three, higher rebates and incentives as a percent of gross revenues due to elevated deal activity consistent with seasonal norms; and finally the lapping of a strong year-ago quarter as border restrictions were lifted in the U.S., U.K. and Canada during Q4 2021. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 PPT to this growth while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 6 to 7 PPT for the quarter. As a reminder, the euro has depreciated significantly year-over-year and is the primary driver of this headwind. From a sensitivity standpoint, based on the current mix of the business, the annual impact to net revenue of a $0.01 change in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar is approximately $55 million.  From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a low double digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 3 PPT to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 4 to 5 PPT for the quarter.  Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics, and finally we expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks Sachin. Audra, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good morning. Sachin, I was just wondering if you could just parse out a little bit of the fourth quarter net revenue expectations - it was a little bit lower than we were thinking. I\u2019m just curious, is it incentives kind of spiking up in the fourth quarter, or is it just the gross number? Any color there would be helpful, thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. Firstly, I\u2019m just going to kick it off by saying the fourth quarter thoughts that I just shared with you are very consistent with what we had shared in our implied fourth quarter numbers when we gave you our full-year guidance at the last earnings call, so very consistent in terms of what we\u2019re sharing with you in terms of fourth quarter. But just a few things I want to emphasize as to what our key assumptions going into the fourth quarter are, one is we continue to believe that there will be a resilient consumer and spending from the consumer relative to 2019 levels will be generally resilient; number two, we are expecting stable to slightly improved cross-border travel growth relative to 2019 levels. In terms of rebates and incentives, to your question, as a percentage of gross revenues we expect them to be higher in the fourth quarter. This is very consistent with our seasonal norms, so nothing unusual as far as I\u2019m concerned there, and then also again if you look at it on a sequential basis, back to comparing fourth quarter to third quarter, there is a lapping effect which I think I talked about, so really the summary of what I guess I\u2019m sharing with you is our fourth quarter thoughts are very consistent to what we had actually shared with you previously.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathanson SVB.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. A question about business resilience, I guess looking forward in the face of potential economic downturn, and just thinking about the fact that over the last several years, Mastercard increased the diversification in the business significantly with more debit, more fast ACH, more services, etc., more B2B, so how do you think about where you are now in terms of resilience of the business, if we do at some point see a slowdown in the consumer side of spending? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Good morning Lisa, thank you for your questions. Let me kick off on that one.  You implied the answer in your question, actually - it is the nature of our continued diversification. Just to remind everybody on why are we diversifying, it is to give us a diversified revenue stream but it\u2019s also to differentiated our payments, and all of that plays hand-in-hand with better services. We\u2019re going to see more payment volumes come out with better services, easier to get into some of the new payment flows - for example, our safety security solutions are well sought after in the P2P space, where there is fraud issues all over the place. All that, I think is a good starting point for us. If I just look back over the last two years where we certainly had a slowdown on the payments side in the macroeconomic overall and services carried the day very significantly very for us, so we\u2019re just going to continue to push harder there. Then new flows, I gave you a whole range of examples earlier on how we are building out the new flows.  To just put some light onto commercial POS, this is existing tools that we have, we don\u2019t need to build a lot for it. It\u2019s a space that we haven\u2019t penetrated significantly in the past, and we are ready and we\u2019re going in. This is a $14 trillion opportunity that we are going after, which is payments diversification going on in addition to our services diversification. Earlier on, the stats on acceptance, just more places where people can spend, in the end people will spend even in a downturn. It doesn\u2019t actually matter for us what they spend on, but if they spend on a Mastercard, we give them more opportunities to do so, so diversification is the name of the game.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys, thanks. Your model is clearly still showing benefits of inflation, and if you could just remind us again the sensitivity in the areas you see and the basis points-driven inflation in that, but also whether or not there\u2019s any pricing changes you guys are interested in employing on the non-basis point side, whether it\u2019s transactions or it\u2019s services, probably more importantly, just given what we\u2019ve seen, or if you\u2019ve done so already. Then maybe just on a side note on that, on the other side would be the expense management and the willingness--just how willing you are on, for example, marketing to flex there if necessary. Thanks, guys.\nSachin Mehra: Hey Darrin, I\u2019ll take that question. I guess to your point around inflation, look - persistent inflation for long periods of time which causes a shift in share of wallet away from carded categories into non-carded categories would be the one area I would actually flag as a potential headwind as it relates to our business model, but putting that issue aside, the reality is you\u2019re very correct about the fact that we charge our basis points in cents per transaction, our basis points are [indiscernible] spend, and that reflects the impact of inflation in there.  The reality is, as we said in the past, part is inflation and inflation in carded categories, we are generally--you know, our business model accounts for that because depending on if it\u2019s carded, it doesn\u2019t matter, like Michael said, whether it\u2019s happening in travel or it\u2019s happening in food and clothing - those are carded categories, and you kind of get the benefit of that coming through.  As it relates to your question on expenses, we\u2019ve always remained disciplined on expenses. A thing which we always keep in mind is a few things: one, we want to make sure that we\u2019re investing in the long term growth of our business along the three strategic priorities which Michael talked about. We will continue to do that. That being said, as we demonstrated during the COVID environment, we do have the opportunity to flex our expenses, whether it\u2019s around marketing, whether it\u2019s around professional fees, whether it\u2019s around T&E, it all is a function of making sure we are keeping an eye on the top line and keeping an eye on the bottom line while we\u2019re actually delivering what we need to do from an expenses standpoint, and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. The reality is we keep a close eye onto what are the things which are in demand from our customers, what is it that the consumer wants, and we are pulsing our expenses in that regard. An example would be, as you remember in COVID, when travel is out of favor, we started to pull back on A&M related to travel - it just didn\u2019t make sense for us to be doing at that point in time, so we\u2019ll remain flexible on that. Then, there are initiatives which we\u2019ve got which are longer term initiatives which will pay off over many, many years in the future, where we have the opportunity to actually pulse the pace at which we\u2019re incurring expenses on those, in the event we start to see a little bit of a slowdown in terms of top line. You asked the question on pricing. Our philosophy around pricing is very consistent as it\u2019s always been: we price for the value we deliver, and our assumption from a pricing standpoint, whether it\u2019s pricing in basis points or cents per transaction, is very tightly correlated to the value we\u2019re delivering to our customers and to the end consumers and to our merchant partners, so all of that\u2019s very consistent at the end of the day. We assume minimum net pricing net of rebates and incentives from a pricing standpoint.\nMichael Miebach: Yes Darrin, I just want to add one point here, and that is looking back at the last two, two and a half years now, back to the second quarter of 2020 when revenue was severely impacted by a truly unprecedented event out there, so to the power of the levers that we have and the range of levers that we have to modulate our expenses - hiring, A&M, professional fees, T&E, market appetite and all of that, it just shows that we did not have to make any compromises when it comes to driving our strategic priorities. We pulled through on flows, we pulled through on services expansion and so forth. The model is wide and flexible - that helps us a lot, and as I look forward, there is optimism in how we\u2019re going to navigate that. \nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Good morning. My first question, can you talk about online debit routing in the U.S.? The Fed very recently put out clarification of rules. If I recall correctly, last time you ended up gaining market share when Durbin was implemented, so how does it impact Mastercard with online debit routing? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Hi Harshita, thanks for the question. There\u2019s always something in debit routing going on, so here we have the clarification of the rule via the Fed. It takes all the way back to a decade ago, when there was this requirement to have two networks on every debit card, and basically what the Fed here clarified is that this is applying to whether it\u2019s a debit transaction that\u2019s made online or in stores, so pretty simple, pretty straightforward. Implementation by middle 2023, so we have some time, but we will be ready and we will be implementing. I think really what that does is we will just continue to compete with all the assets that we have in debit. I\u2019m not really sure what this will do to the market, but we will certainly be there leveraging our technology to win more debit in the United States. \nSachin Mehra: And Harshita, I\u2019ll just add one additional comment to what Michael just said, which is, as you know, we\u2019ve been investing pretty heavily in our services capabilities, some of which relate to cyber intelligence, and in an environment where our partners, whether it\u2019s the merchants or the issuers, need more of our services to better manage their core capabilities in the online environment, we stand ready to do that as well.\nHarshita Rawat: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang at JP Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thank you. Good morning. You mentioned nothing unusual on rebates and incentives, but I just wanted to ask, as I sometimes always do, with deal activity versus 90 days ago, any change there in issuer appetite to drive program growth versus maybe more disciplined growth on their side? Are there changes in timing of deals and implementation, things of that nature? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure Tien-Tsin, I can take that. Tien-Tsin, I think you know that we\u2019ve been active in the marketplace. We\u2019ve been winning share globally, and that\u2019s just part of the strategy of what we want to do, which is on a disciplined, profitable basis - we want to win share and deliver more in the nature of services on that share to optimize and grow our overall network. I\u2019ll start with that as kind of the headline. But on your specific question on Q4 on rebates and incentives, nothing unusual. It\u2019s a rich pipeline. We continue to be active in the marketplace. We\u2019re not seeing any changed behavior or patterns as it relates to how our issuing partners are in the marketplace, and we just remain active and that\u2019s really the essence of what we\u2019re seeing there.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great, thanks for the update.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll move to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi Michael, hi Sachin. If I can ask about cross-border, now that we have seen some normalization in travel, if you could talk about how much more travel improvement there is yet to come in your view, and the mix of cross-border now that some normalization has happened as we look to travel versus non-travel. \nSachin Mehra: Sure Ashwin, I can take that question. Firstly, I kind of mentioned that as we said in the last earnings call, we saw opportunity in terms of further recovery in travel. We saw some of that come through in our Q3 numbers. We still believe there is potential from a cross-border travel recovery standpoint, in particular in Asia-Pacific. I shared a metric about how Asia-Pacific inbound cross-border travel at approximately 76% in Q3 off 2019 levels, so that just goes to show there\u2019s some more room to grow there. There are several markets in Asia-Pacific which still remain to be opened. Also, airlines are bringing more capacity back on. As you know from our personal experiences, getting seats on planes is hard and it\u2019s expensive, and so the reality is all of that should be helpful in terms of the potential for cross-border travel recovery. The other point which I think you alluded to, Ashwin, is as it relates to the mix, and the mix is always so important because the mix of cross-border has not reverted back to historical mixes; so said differently, if you remember as we were going through COVID, we first saw a recovery take place in intra-Europe, and you know intra-Europe is generally lower yielding. We\u2019ve recently been seeing a stronger growth pattern in ex intra-Europe cross-border, and so the reality is that mix is not back to the pre-pandemic levels at this point in time.\nMichael Miebach: Just one thing to add, this isn\u2019t exactly your question, but that whole space had been a focus for us pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and now. While airlines were struggling with really no flights taking off, we were a strong partner and it showed in how the engagement with airlines and travel-oriented portfolios work now, so we stand well positioned to benefit from the trends that Sachin just talked about, on the services side as well as in the payments and co-brand side, so exciting space. I think our bets are paying off.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Rayna Kumar at UBS.\nRayna Kumar: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. You continue to see very strong growth in Latin America - 29% GDV growth in the quarter. Can you discuss some of the key drivers of that growth and how sustainable you think it could be going into 4Q and into 2023? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Rayna, let me start off on that. Latin America, fascinating region for us, highly diverse from super well developed Brazil to markets at the other end of the spectrum, high travel markets with the Caribbean, Mexico, so you have all of that in the mix. It\u2019s really interesting - when you peel the onion of it and you look at some of these markets and you compare them, two of the largest markets for example, Brazil and Mexico, if you look at the digital penetration in Mexico compared to Brazil, there is so much more potential to go, so there is upside in digitization. There is other issues that require some of our solutions. The region has experienced some fraud issues, generally in payments, so our safety and security solutions are in great demand and are a great driver for growth for us in the region while the underlying digitization continues, so you put those trends together, it\u2019s all fairly attractive. Then I talked to you about our engagement in the crypto economy. If there is one place in the world where crypto is really in focus, it\u2019s in that part of the world. Historic pain through high inflation and so forth, people were thinking crypto might be an answer. A lot of innovation in this space, so across all payments services and new payment flows and innovation, this is a region that has shown momentum for us.\nSachin Mehra: Yes Rayna, I\u2019ll just bring to light one of the points which Michael talked about in terms of increased trends towards digitization. As it relates to our performance in Latin America in Q3 and going forward, the reality is we\u2019ve been very focused on the conversion of Maestro to debit Mastercard, and this has been part of what we as a company have been doing for a very long time. You are seeing the fruits of that come through, because as you know, as you go down the path of converting Maestro to debit Mastercard, whether it\u2019s a companion digital debit Mastercard or it\u2019s an actual conversion of the card, now it becomes an enabler for online transactions, that digital trend which Michael is talking about. It\u2019s all about us trying to enable those cards, and we\u2019ve been seeing good migration state there from Maestro to debit Mastercard.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys, good morning. I want to see if you can unpack a little bit what you\u2019re seeing in terms of consumer spending across different parts of Europe, and then Sachin, wanted to see if you could make just a quick comment around what you guys are envisioning, the potential FX headwind to revenue in 2023, just based on current rates. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, so Jason, I\u2019ll give you--on your first one, and then I\u2019ll get into the FX question which you\u2019re talking about. In terms of Europe, we continue to see good Mastercard performance in Europe. Remember in terms of what you are seeing in our metrics, you\u2019re seeing not only what the underlying economies are doing but also the impact of our share growth which has been taking place in Europe. It\u2019s kind of the amalgamation of all of that which is coming through. In terms of regional patterns, I would tell you that we\u2019re not necessarily seeing any meaningful change in terms of trends across the continent, in terms of how the spending patterns are taking place. The consumer generally, back to our comment earlier around consumer being resilient and strength in consumer, that\u2019s certainly the case.  Now, as you think about different markets, end markets like the U.K., we\u2019re seeing stronger growth. A large part of that is being driven by the fact that we\u2019ve had recent share wins in the U.K., and then there were share wins we\u2019ve spoken about in the past in continental Europe which are still to come to effect, so for example we talked about our win with Deutsche Bank in Germany, that\u2019s still to come to effect. Anyway, this is a mix of all of that which is kind of taking place at this point in time. On your question around FX, I shared with you in my prepared remarks what\u2019s the annual impact on net revenue of a $0.01 change in the value of the euro would be relative to U.S. dollar, which is about $55 million on an annual basis. We wanted to put that out there so you have a sense on what the potential headwind or tailwind could be, depending on what happens with FX rates. The hard part is predicting FX rates, and so given the current mix of our business, that\u2019s the sensitivity which I\u2019d share with you as it relates to how you should think about what the impact could be for 2023.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Tim Chiodo at Credit Suisse.\nTim Chiodo: Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit on Mastercard Send relative to Visa Direct. I was wondering if you could call out for us and investors any of the different, maybe strategic focus areas, if there are any pricing differences, if there are any mechanical differences or maybe use cases where you seem to be getting traction relative to Visa Direct. That would be extremely helpful.\nMichael Miebach: All right, let me take that. All Visa-related stuff, you should ask them, obviously, so I\u2019m not going to do a direct comparison here, but I can tell you how we are thinking about it.  First of all, just earlier on I talked a lot about the crypto space. I\u2019d just give you one example. Here is an interesting new technology and a growing ecosystem, and what\u2019s the way to get out of your crypto wallet balances is you turn it into fiat and you use Mastercard Send. We were right on this from the first day and we have all the partnerships that do exactly that. Then you go around and basically there is new flows, there is geographies, there is use cases, so those are the dimensions on how we are looking at this. We are very systematic about it. This has to have ubiquity. We\u2019re looking at all regions from a coverage perspective. We\u2019re looking at the key use cases. We\u2019re very selective of use cases because here, you could get lost in a thousand flowers bloom. The examples I gave to you on partnering with large global firms like AirBnB, that is the approach, where you\u2019re going to say you partner with somebody that is in all the regions and covers the use cases which matter to people out there.  That\u2019s essentially the approach on Mastercard Send. It has a domestic angle to it and it has a cross-border angle to it. It grows at significant rates, we\u2019re very happy with it across all of these aspects that I just said.  One thing to add - earlier we were talking about the numbers ex-Russia, so Russia was a huge success on Send from day one. That\u2019s in fact where a lot of our learnings came from. We exited Russia, as you know in March of this year, so that is skewing the numbers a little bit, but the learnings are not going away. We\u2019re putting that into a whole set of other markets, and to the earlier question around Europe, particularly in Europe we see some of those learnings translate in other parts of Eastern Europe countries and so forth. \nSachin Mehra: Just to add to what Michael said, particularly on the remittances side, we\u2019re seeing very good traction take place in terms of cross-border remittances and the capabilities we\u2019ve got there and the capabilities we\u2019re building there. Our global reach out there is holding us in really good stead as it relates to how we are able to tap our partners to generate more and more volume down that path, so that\u2019s a--it\u2019s a bright spot in terms of the broad remittances piece as well.\nTim Chiodo: Excellent, thank you for all that context on Mastercard Send.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Jeffrey at Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Michael, I wonder if you could give us an update on your processing efforts globally, maybe with an emphasis in Europe, whether you\u2019re taking share and winning business in processing and how you think that can affect over time both the net revenue yield and maybe the profitability of the business, too. \nMichael Miebach: Right, so Andrew, thanks for that question. You know, starting with Europe but then we could extend this conversation looking at the Middle East or at Asia, so we have processing assets in those parts of the world. Just to illustrate how this matters, there is obviously a whole new set of players that are entering the payment space whose prime raison d\u2019\u00eatre isn\u2019t really to process, they want to have a great financial app, so they\u2019re looking downstream for a whole set of solutions that complete what they do, make it relatively easy out of one hand, and that\u2019s what we provide. This is really the explanation for some of our progress on the fintech side, on the neo-bank side. Those guys, where we have those partnerships, 70% win rate I\u2019d like to add here, is really to a large extent coming down to our processing capabilities, which are state of the art, modern, fintech-oriented processing capabilities.  It\u2019s been a joy for us to watch. In some parts of the world, we are doing partnerships, for example with Network International in parts of Africa and so forth, so it\u2019s a combination of our own assets where we feel there is scale and differentiation, and sometimes it\u2019s through partners. Overall, there is a good play here in processing and it\u2019s one of the services that we have in our portfolio.\nSachin Mehra: I\u2019ll just add some color as it relates to--beyond the processing fees, on our efforts around switching and the proportion of our total Mastercard branded transactions, which as you know, we\u2019ve been pushing hard to actually get more switching share. The reality is that is working very nicely. We are seeing growth in our proportion of switch transactions, which now stands at greater than 60% of total transactions worldwide, and that\u2019s super important. Particularly where we\u2019re seeing improvements and progress is in Latin America and in Asia-Pacific, both of which have been generally low index markets from a switch transaction share standpoint in the past, so lots of good effort going on there and we are seeing good progress come through.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning. Sachin, just wanted to go through the yield improvements again. It sounds like it\u2019s a lot of mix and some pricing in there. How do we think about the yield going forward into the fourth quarter and into next year? Do some comps get a little tougher as we get into next year for these yields? Thanks. \nSachin Mehra: Sure. Bryan, what you\u2019re seeing in the nature of yield improvement quarter-over-quarter, this is net revenue yield divided by GDV, you can attribute a large part of that to just mix. As you know, our inter cross-border has come back pretty nicely, and as that has come back nicely, that is high yielding and that gives us the benefit and the deal wins you are seeing on a sequential basis.  I will point out that as it relates to Q4, you should expect that the yield will decline some, which is very consistent with what you see every year. That is just the nature of how the business works, just because Q3 happens to be a large cross-border quarter and you tend to see the benefit of that come through, and Q4 you start to see some of that slow down. Now you asked a question about 2023. I would tell you, we as a business continue to remain very focused on driving and maximizing our net revenue yield, and there\u2019s multiple factors which are going to influence that, some of which is the mix of cross-border domestic certainly, but also things around just like we just talked about, how we are increasing our proportion of switch transactions. The more switching we do, the greater the yield gets, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. How we talked about the shift from Maestro to debit Mastercard - again, lots of focus around that, and so we\u2019re very focused around driving that.  All of which, when you overlay all the services we\u2019ve been bringing to the market, you get the benefit of that coming through as well, so generally speaking as I look forward, I kind of feel like our focus as a business from a driving yield standpoint continues, and I don\u2019t see anything necessarily which is going to change dramatically going into 2023 from a yield trajectory standpoint.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, and Sachin just kind of explained the strategy again, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying. We\u2019re trying to be in the payments transaction at profitable levels, but then use our services to continue to improve the overall revenue yield, and it\u2019s that combination that makes us look at the future very optimistically.  I don\u2019t really see anything changing here. These are the tools that we have, and we\u2019re using them effectively.\nBryan Keane: Great, thank you both.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll move to Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I had one on rebates and incentives, and more specifically kind of how the mix of those rebates and incentives has changed over the past several years. I guess the underlying question is, are you having to incentivize an expanding number of value chain players - fintechs, merchants to kind of support consistent growth? How is that mix of [indiscernible], how do you expect it to evolve in the future?\nSachin Mehra: Yes, so in terms of rebates and incentives, the mix in terms of how we are actually incentivizing to generate incremental revenue has not changed meaningfully. We\u2019ve historically been more focused and we have actually delivered higher levels of rebates and incentives to our issuing partners, that continues to be the case as to where we are actually expending most of our rebates and incentives dollars, and that really hasn\u2019t changed.  As it relates to the mix between rebates and incentives for domestic volumes versus cross-border, I\u2019d say that mix also hasn\u2019t really changed. As you know, cross-border has generally been indexed lower from a rebates and incentives standpoint, and that continues very much to be the pattern right now as well, Ramsey. \nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, so pretty stable environment is what it sounds like.\nSachin Mehra: Yes, yes. For sure.\nRamsey El-Assal: All right, appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to David Togut at Evercore ISI. Sir, you may have your line on mute, we\u2019re not hearing you.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Audra, maybe we can go to the next, please, and then we\u2019ll see if we can get David back on.\nOperator: Yes, we\u2019ll move next to Bob Napoli at William Blair. \nBob Napoli: Hi, thank you and good morning. Just would like an update on your B2B--your thoughts around the B2B payments market and the opportunities there. I know you called out a commercial POS of $14 trillion. What inning are we in? Any thoughts, any changes to that market, the growth of that market? Thank you. \nMichael Miebach: Right, yes. I\u2019m really not into baseball analogies, so that\u2019s why earlier I was talking about the first half of the game. But to your question very specifically, B2B, huge opportunity from a volume perspective. We called it out and we cut it down into very distinct types of flows at our investor day at the end of last year, so focus on B2B accounts payable on one hand, but there is other B2B flows which we\u2019re very active in. For example, through all the illustrations I gave you earlier on virtual card use cases, virtual card is the current and most immediate answer to go after B2B flows. There is the commercial POS piece somewhere, which is kind of in an in-between space between B2B and small business, but that\u2019s a huge space with a lot of cash and checks. You build it up over those into the accounts payable piece, and you know the long range vision that we have on accounts payable is really the Mastercard Track business payment service piece, where we say over time we\u2019re building a two-sided network here. That continues to grow, but that takes time. But we have large players around the table - HSBC, JP and so forth, so that\u2019s a good initiative for us, but for now, we are very active on virtual cards to solve the issues of buyers and suppliers in the space. We have not moved away from this by any stretch of the imagination. This is a huge opportunity and we\u2019re going to go after it.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Audra, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take that question from Jamie Friedman at Susquehanna Financial Group.\nJamie Friedman : Hi. Sachin, transaction processing fees increased 15%, but switched transactions increased 9%. I know you called out in your prepared remarks mix changes. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on that. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, so there are a few things going on there, where our transaction fees are growing faster than the underlying driver, one of which is the mix change. Really, remember when we make cross-border revenues, we make cross-border revenues on a basis point basis as well as on a cents per transaction, and the component which is on basis points sits in cross-border volume fees, and then some component of cross-border related cents per transaction that sits in terms of number of transactions which we process, which sits in transaction processing fees, which is where the mix effect come through because as we\u2019ve seen inter cross-border grow at a rapid pace, that\u2019s contributing to that delta between what we are seeing in the revenue line and what we are seeing in the driver, because cross-border is higher yielding than is domestic.  There are a couple other factors which caused that differential as well. I talked about FX-related revenues and some level of pricing - those are the two other contributors which go into that, Jamie.\nJamie Friedman: Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: All right, let me bring the call to a close. Thank you for your questions, and to all of our investors, thank you for your support.  This morning I sent a note to our colleagues here at Mastercard thanking them for a strong quarter, because they are the ones who make all of this happen, so a shout-out to them as always. With that, we\u2019ll talk to you in the next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 23% supported by resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 PPT to this growth.  Operating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 PPT increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 27%, which includes a 1 PPT decrease related to acquisitions.  EPS was up 22% year-over-year to $2.68, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $505 million through October 24, 2022.  Let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV increased by 11% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 18%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 20%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 2%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of the previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%.  Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12% with credit growth of 15% and debit growth of 9%. Cross-border volume was up 44% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.  Turning to Page 5, switch transactions grew 9% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switch transactions grew 19% year-over-year in Q3. Card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 54% of all in person switch purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 10% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 23% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 PPT to this growth.  Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 9% while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57% while cross-border volumes increased 44%. The 13 PPT difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross border volumes this quarter.  Transaction processing fees were up 22% while switch transaction grew 9%. The 13 PPT difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues, and pricing.  Other revenues were up 22%, including a 2 PPT contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our cyber intelligence and data services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 26% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving onto Page 7, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, total adjusted operating expenses increased 17%, including a 3 PPT impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.  Turning now to Page 8, let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of October. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in the stack which shows all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russia-issued cards from prior periods. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in October. As expected, the year-over-year growth metrics faced tougher comps as we began lapping periods in 2021 when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound. However, it is important to note that all metrics continue to hold up well relative to 2019 levels. Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switch volumes, for the first three weeks of October we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 PPT versus Q3. Switch transactions grew 9% year-over-year through the first three weeks of October, consistent with Q3. As a reminder, Russia has a relatively low average ticket size which results in a larger relative impact to this metric.  Overall, cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of October grew 36% year-over-year, down 8 PPT versus Q3. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as border restrictions continued to be lifted. In the first three weeks of October, cross-border travel was up 62% year-over-year, down 11 PPT versus Q3 due to more difficult year-ago comps, as I just noted. Cross-border travel is now at 125% of 2019 levels, up 1 PPT from Q3 levels.  Cross-border card not present excluding travel was up 12% year-over-year in October, which includes the impact of significant ecommerce promotional activities and is down 1 PPT from Q3. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.  Turning to Page 9, I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. Let me begin by saying that the execution of our strategic priorities is translating into expanded and deeper customer relationships and the broader adoption of our material solutions and differentiated services. Consumer spending remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and cross-border travel continues to recover as border restrictions ease and consumers shift their spending back towards travel. Just to update you on some metrics we are tracking, Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel pre-pandemic in 2019, is at approximately 76% of 2019 levels in Q3, up from about 60% in Q2. We continue to believe there is more room to grow as several travel corridors, particularly in Asia, still remain restricted and airline industry capacity continues to build back up. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel arrangement portfolios and services offerings, including access to an extensive airport lounge network and concierge services and our global Mastercard Travel Rewards program, which allows issuers and merchants to connect to provide consumers with unique benefits through a simple digital experience. As we have laid out, there are a number of factors that could influence future economic growth. These include elevated inflation and rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions balanced against low unemployment, rising wages, and high savings levels in particular. We are monitoring each of these and, as Michael just said, we are prepared to act quickly to adjust our expenses to reflect any meaningful change to top line growth. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the high end of the mid-teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This is consistent with prior expectations and sequentially reflects, one, generally resilient consumer spending relative to 2019 levels; two, stable to slightly improved cross-border travel growth relative to 2019 levels with some continued improvement into Asia and some moderation within Europe; three, higher rebates and incentives as a percent of gross revenues due to elevated deal activity consistent with seasonal norms; and finally the lapping of a strong year-ago quarter as border restrictions were lifted in the U.S., U.K. and Canada during Q4 2021. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 PPT to this growth while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 6 to 7 PPT for the quarter. As a reminder, the euro has depreciated significantly year-over-year and is the primary driver of this headwind. From a sensitivity standpoint, based on the current mix of the business, the annual impact to net revenue of a $0.01 change in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar is approximately $55 million.  From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a low double digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 3 PPT to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 4 to 5 PPT for the quarter.  Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics, and finally we expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Warren. Sure. Firstly, I'm just going to kick it off by saying the fourth quarter thoughts that I just shared with you are very consistent with what we had shared in our implied fourth quarter numbers when we gave you our full-year guidance at the last earnings call, so very consistent in terms of what we're sharing with you in terms of fourth quarter. But just a few things I want to emphasize as to what our key assumptions going into the fourth quarter are, one is we continue to believe that there will be a resilient consumer and spending from the consumer relative to 2019 levels will be generally resilient; number two, we are expecting stable to slightly improved cross-border travel growth relative to 2019 levels. In terms of rebates and incentives, to your question, as a percentage of gross revenues we expect them to be higher in the fourth quarter. This is very consistent with our seasonal norms, so nothing unusual as far as I'm concerned there, and then also again if you look at it on a sequential basis, back to comparing fourth quarter to third quarter, there is a lapping effect which I think I talked about, so really the summary of what I guess I'm sharing with you is our fourth quarter thoughts are very consistent to what we had actually shared with you previously. Hey Darrin, I'll take that question. I guess to your point around inflation, look - persistent inflation for long periods of time which causes a shift in share of wallet away from carded categories into non-carded categories would be the one area I would actually flag as a potential headwind as it relates to our business model, but putting that issue aside, the reality is you're very correct about the fact that we charge our basis points in cents per transaction, our basis points are [indiscernible] spend, and that reflects the impact of inflation in there.  The reality is, as we said in the past, part is inflation and inflation in carded categories, we are generally--you know, our business model accounts for that because depending on if it's carded, it doesn't matter, like Michael said, whether it's happening in travel or it's happening in food and clothing - those are carded categories, and you kind of get the benefit of that coming through.  As it relates to your question on expenses, we've always remained disciplined on expenses. A thing which we always keep in mind is a few things: one, we want to make sure that we're investing in the long term growth of our business along the three strategic priorities which Michael talked about. We will continue to do that. That being said, as we demonstrated during the COVID environment, we do have the opportunity to flex our expenses, whether it's around marketing, whether it's around professional fees, whether it's around T&E, it all is a function of making sure we are keeping an eye on the top line and keeping an eye on the bottom line while we're actually delivering what we need to do from an expenses standpoint, and we'll continue to do that going forward. The reality is we keep a close eye onto what are the things which are in demand from our customers, what is it that the consumer wants, and we are pulsing our expenses in that regard. An example would be, as you remember in COVID, when travel is out of favor, we started to pull back on A&M related to travel - it just didn't make sense for us to be doing at that point in time, so we'll remain flexible on that. Then, there are initiatives which we've got which are longer term initiatives which will pay off over many, many years in the future, where we have the opportunity to actually pulse the pace at which we're incurring expenses on those, in the event we start to see a little bit of a slowdown in terms of top line. You asked the question on pricing. Our philosophy around pricing is very consistent as it's always been: we price for the value we deliver, and our assumption from a pricing standpoint, whether it's pricing in basis points or cents per transaction, is very tightly correlated to the value we're delivering to our customers and to the end consumers and to our merchant partners, so all of that's very consistent at the end of the day. We assume minimum net pricing net of rebates and incentives from a pricing standpoint. And Harshita, I'll just add one additional comment to what Michael just said, which is, as you know, we've been investing pretty heavily in our services capabilities, some of which relate to cyber intelligence, and in an environment where our partners, whether it's the merchants or the issuers, need more of our services to better manage their core capabilities in the online environment, we stand ready to do that as well. Sure Tien-Tsin, I can take that. Tien-Tsin, I think you know that we've been active in the marketplace. We've been winning share globally, and that's just part of the strategy of what we want to do, which is on a disciplined, profitable basis - we want to win share and deliver more in the nature of services on that share to optimize and grow our overall network. I'll start with that as kind of the headline. But on your specific question on Q4 on rebates and incentives, nothing unusual. It's a rich pipeline. We continue to be active in the marketplace. We're not seeing any changed behavior or patterns as it relates to how our issuing partners are in the marketplace, and we just remain active and that's really the essence of what we're seeing there. Sure Ashwin, I can take that question. Firstly, I kind of mentioned that as we said in the last earnings call, we saw opportunity in terms of further recovery in travel. We saw some of that come through in our Q3 numbers. We still believe there is potential from a cross-border travel recovery standpoint, in particular in Asia-Pacific. I shared a metric about how Asia-Pacific inbound cross-border travel at approximately 76% in Q3 off 2019 levels, so that just goes to show there's some more room to grow there. There are several markets in Asia-Pacific which still remain to be opened. Also, airlines are bringing more capacity back on. As you know from our personal experiences, getting seats on planes is hard and it's expensive, and so the reality is all of that should be helpful in terms of the potential for cross-border travel recovery. The other point which I think you alluded to, Ashwin, is as it relates to the mix, and the mix is always so important because the mix of cross-border has not reverted back to historical mixes; so said differently, if you remember as we were going through COVID, we first saw a recovery take place in intra-Europe, and you know intra-Europe is generally lower yielding. We've recently been seeing a stronger growth pattern in ex intra-Europe cross-border, and so the reality is that mix is not back to the pre-pandemic levels at this point in time. Yes Rayna, I'll just bring to light one of the points which Michael talked about in terms of increased trends towards digitization. As it relates to our performance in Latin America in Q3 and going forward, the reality is we've been very focused on the conversion of Maestro to debit Mastercard, and this has been part of what we as a company have been doing for a very long time. You are seeing the fruits of that come through, because as you know, as you go down the path of converting Maestro to debit Mastercard, whether it's a companion digital debit Mastercard or it's an actual conversion of the card, now it becomes an enabler for online transactions, that digital trend which Michael is talking about. It's all about us trying to enable those cards, and we've been seeing good migration state there from Maestro to debit Mastercard. Sure, so Jason, I'll give you--on your first one, and then I'll get into the FX question which you're talking about. In terms of Europe, we continue to see good Mastercard performance in Europe. Remember in terms of what you are seeing in our metrics, you're seeing not only what the underlying economies are doing but also the impact of our share growth which has been taking place in Europe. It's kind of the amalgamation of all of that which is coming through. In terms of regional patterns, I would tell you that we're not necessarily seeing any meaningful change in terms of trends across the continent, in terms of how the spending patterns are taking place. The consumer generally, back to our comment earlier around consumer being resilient and strength in consumer, that's certainly the case.  Now, as you think about different markets, end markets like the U.K., we're seeing stronger growth. A large part of that is being driven by the fact that we've had recent share wins in the U.K., and then there were share wins we've spoken about in the past in continental Europe which are still to come to effect, so for example we talked about our win with Deutsche Bank in Germany, that's still to come to effect. Anyway, this is a mix of all of that which is kind of taking place at this point in time. On your question around FX, I shared with you in my prepared remarks what's the annual impact on net revenue of a $0.01 change in the value of the euro would be relative to U.S. dollar, which is about $55 million on an annual basis. We wanted to put that out there so you have a sense on what the potential headwind or tailwind could be, depending on what happens with FX rates. The hard part is predicting FX rates, and so given the current mix of our business, that's the sensitivity which I'd share with you as it relates to how you should think about what the impact could be for 2023. Just to add to what Michael said, particularly on the remittances side, we're seeing very good traction take place in terms of cross-border remittances and the capabilities we've got there and the capabilities we're building there. Our global reach out there is holding us in really good stead as it relates to how we are able to tap our partners to generate more and more volume down that path, so that's a--it's a bright spot in terms of the broad remittances piece as well. I'll just add some color as it relates to--beyond the processing fees, on our efforts around switching and the proportion of our total Mastercard branded transactions, which as you know, we've been pushing hard to actually get more switching share. The reality is that is working very nicely. We are seeing growth in our proportion of switch transactions, which now stands at greater than 60% of total transactions worldwide, and that's super important. Particularly where we're seeing improvements and progress is in Latin America and in Asia-Pacific, both of which have been generally low index markets from a switch transaction share standpoint in the past, so lots of good effort going on there and we are seeing good progress come through. Sure. Bryan, what you're seeing in the nature of yield improvement quarter-over-quarter, this is net revenue yield divided by GDV, you can attribute a large part of that to just mix. As you know, our inter cross-border has come back pretty nicely, and as that has come back nicely, that is high yielding and that gives us the benefit and the deal wins you are seeing on a sequential basis.  I will point out that as it relates to Q4, you should expect that the yield will decline some, which is very consistent with what you see every year. That is just the nature of how the business works, just because Q3 happens to be a large cross-border quarter and you tend to see the benefit of that come through, and Q4 you start to see some of that slow down. Now you asked a question about 2023. I would tell you, we as a business continue to remain very focused on driving and maximizing our net revenue yield, and there's multiple factors which are going to influence that, some of which is the mix of cross-border domestic certainly, but also things around just like we just talked about, how we are increasing our proportion of switch transactions. The more switching we do, the greater the yield gets, and that's what we're focused on. How we talked about the shift from Maestro to debit Mastercard - again, lots of focus around that, and so we're very focused around driving that.  All of which, when you overlay all the services we've been bringing to the market, you get the benefit of that coming through as well, so generally speaking as I look forward, I kind of feel like our focus as a business from a driving yield standpoint continues, and I don't see anything necessarily which is going to change dramatically going into 2023 from a yield trajectory standpoint. Yes, so in terms of rebates and incentives, the mix in terms of how we are actually incentivizing to generate incremental revenue has not changed meaningfully. We've historically been more focused and we have actually delivered higher levels of rebates and incentives to our issuing partners, that continues to be the case as to where we are actually expending most of our rebates and incentives dollars, and that really hasn't changed.  As it relates to the mix between rebates and incentives for domestic volumes versus cross-border, I'd say that mix also hasn't really changed. As you know, cross-border has generally been indexed lower from a rebates and incentives standpoint, and that continues very much to be the pattern right now as well, Ramsey. Yes, yes. For sure. Sure, so there are a few things going on there, where our transaction fees are growing faster than the underlying driver, one of which is the mix change. Really, remember when we make cross-border revenues, we make cross-border revenues on a basis point basis as well as on a cents per transaction, and the component which is on basis points sits in cross-border volume fees, and then some component of cross-border related cents per transaction that sits in terms of number of transactions which we process, which sits in transaction processing fees, which is where the mix effect come through because as we've seen inter cross-border grow at a rapid pace, that's contributing to that delta between what we are seeing in the revenue line and what we are seeing in the driver, because cross-border is higher yielding than is domestic.  There are a couple other factors which caused that differential as well. I talked about FX-related revenues and some level of pricing - those are the two other contributors which go into that, Jamie."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you Warren. Good morning everyone. Let's get right into it. The headline is that consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover. With this backdrop, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth through the focused execution of our strategy. Third quarter net revenues were up 23% and adjusted operating income up 27%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.  The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain. Inflationary pressures have remained elevated and central banks are continuing to take aggressive steps to bring inflation in line. Tensions remain high with the war in Ukraine and the supply of natural gas to Europe is a concern. Despite all of this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising, consumer savings levels remain elevated, and credit is readily accessible. In this setting, overall consumer spending has remained resilient, although we are seeing some shift in what consumers are buying.  Looking at our switch volume trends, domestic volumes remain steady, showing growth relative to 2019 levels, relatively consistent to the second quarter 2022. The trend towards spending on experiences continues. We saw notable strength in airlines, lodging and restaurant spend with a shift away from categories like home furnishings and appliances. The current mix between retail T&E and other categories of spend is now broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. Cross-border continues to recover as border restrictions are progressively relaxed. Cross-border travel in the third quarter has reached 124% of 2019 levels. Relative to 2019 levels, most regions are up sequentially, including a notable improvement in Asia. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to hold up well.   Notwithstanding the continued strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely, including fiscal, monetary and other policy actions taken in response to events. This will inform our actions, as it always has. Should the market outlook weaken, we are prepared to act quickly to modulate our expenses. As we demonstrated during the pandemic, we have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers and will do so while maintaining focus on our three key strategic priorities. The focus on these areas will create new opportunities for growth. It starts by solidifying our positions in payments complemented by our differentiated services line and our expansion into adjacent activities like open banking and digital identity. Moving onto some examples of how we are progressing against each of these, first we are expanding in payments by enabling digital transformation with our customers, [indiscernible] volume growth, expanding acceptance, and capturing new payment flows. There are now over 3 billion Mastercards in circulation supported in part by programs such as our Digital First initiative.  Our Digital First solution starts with the ability for a consumer to acquire and then use a new card digitally in real time. It's helping customers create a best-in-class digital experience leading to increased approval rates on average by two percentage points, reduce fraud on average by four basis points, and increase spend per active account on average by 10%. To date, we have launched over 200 Digital First customers around the globe. Santander in Mexico, Chase in the U.K., Citibanamex, ING in Spain, and Nubank in Brazil are amongst the latest customers to partner with Mastercard to deliver and end-to-end Digital First customer journey. Also, we're driving growth in volume with new and renewed wins across a broad set of partners. In the U.S., we recently extended our exclusive deal with Keybanc for debit, credit, commercial and small business, as well as deepened our relationship on services. This quarter in partnership with Chase, we will launch a new co-run program with DoorDash. This deal further expands our presence in the digital food delivery space. We also went live with the Uber Pro Card, an enhanced loyalty and payments experience that will help drivers in Korea save on gas, fees and other expenses. In Europe, we have seen momentum in Italy with [indiscernible] securing an expanded deal that includes a credit and prepaid flip, as well as securing the current Mastercard portfolio. In Latin America, we have renewed our exclusivity agreement with Mercado Libre and secured incremental credit share with Banco Scotiabank Colpatria. Overall, another great quarter with notable wins.  Let's shift to one area that is sometimes underappreciated, that is how we are enabling growth in payments by giving people and businesses more places to use their Mastercard. We have added more acceptance locations in the last five years than the previous 50, and we are now accepted at more than 90 million merchant locations.  The preference for contactless payments that grew over the last two years continues. More than half of the in-person switch purchase transactions are now tapped, up from approximately one-third pre-pandemic, and this trend will be bolstered by the adoption of new technologies such as tap on phone.  Further, our technology and global reach enabled growth in acceptance while helping our partners drive their digital strategies. For example, we have signed with McDonald's to use our gateway capabilities enabling them to easily offer more solutions to new markets, beginning in Middle East and Africa.  Finally, we're driving growth in payments by leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. We continue to make progress in going after flows in the disbursements and remittances space by expanding into new use cases and geographies. For example, in the U.S. gig economy, we've signed a new global agreement with AirBnB to facilitate host payouts using Mastercard Send in select markets.  We have also expanded with gaming payouts, launching our Gaming Fast payout program. To address [indiscernible] account exported domestic payments, we have signed a deal with Pagero, a leading global B2B network and solutions provider that provides account payable automation to some of the world's largest corporate brands.  We're also growing commercial point-of-sale transactions by targeting small business, corporate T&E, purchasing and fleet flows. In the U.S., we announced our exclusive co-brand partnership with First National Bank of Omaha to issue the [indiscernible] small business card. This product offers small business owners industry-leading access to tools, benefits and services with a focus on equitable access to credit - very important.  We also continue to target B2B accounts payable flows by expanding access and reach leveraging our virtual card capabilities. We signed a deal with Marqueta to enable our next generation virtual card solution, Instant Pay. This solution intelligently and automatically sends instant payments to suppliers. We have also signed an agreement with SAP Taulia to integrate our virtual card solutions into Taulia and their SAP solutions, enabling their customers to facilitate virtual card payments.  We're also well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel with our Mastercard wholesale travel program. In Bahrain, we signed a deal with Infinios travel agency and travel management company volumes, and in Europe, we signed a deal with a fintech, Swile, while going after B2B travel flows in Europe and Latin America. As you can see, we continue to make steady progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows. Now turning to services, where we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth, our services delivered a diversified revenue stream for Mastercard beyond payments. They accomplished this by adding new service capabilities as well as extending existing service offerings into new and existing customers. There continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity in this space. First off, we're excited about dynamic yield's unique personalization platform which offers a great example of how we're adding new service capabilities. Since complementing the acquisition earlier this year, we have added dozens of new retail and commerce customers. A great example is [indiscernible], a German fashion store. I always share German examples if I can. They have more than 1,400 stores in Europe. We have deployed our content personalization capabilities to additional markets. In addition, we are expanding our capabilities to financial institutions.  Now, beyond adding new services, there's an opportunity for over-extending existing offerings into new and existing customers. In the third quarter, we signed an agreement with Sky Italia, part of Sky Group, one of Europe's leading media and entertainment companies, to enrich and commercialize a new service to support small businesses. mBurse, a technology provider to insurance companies is implementing our card link services for their micro savings program with Generali Insurance in Switzerland, and in Spain we have grown our relationship with Caxiabank with one of our largest European [indiscernible] deals. The deal enables them to provide a more efficient charge-back flow for all their card portfolios. Beyond expanding in payments and extending our services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks. As a reminder, our current focus is on two areas: open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I'll touch on open banking. While open banking is early in the game, it is a tremendous opportunity. We are engaged with a broad set of financial institutions and fintechs who are increasingly interested in a wide range of use cases. What's unique and interesting here is that we are the partner that brings what is needed to scale and instill confidence in the space, things like responsible data practices, consumer protections, and deep compliance, all on top of our robust technical capabilities, broad connectivity and extensive applications. Just to give you a flavor, in the U.S. Quicken, a leading provider of financial management solutions, has selected Mastercard as their provider of consumer permission data for its popular Simplify budgeting platform. We're also working with Fidelity to support their innovation in student loan repayment for organizations that want to help their employees improve their financial wellness. Then there's Jack Henry, which will enable community and regional financial institutions to be at the center of their account holders' financial lives. They will do this providing stability to securely see all of their financial accounts within and outside a primary financial institution in a single view. This will help enable consumers and businesses to make more informed financial decisions. This is just the beginning and much more to come in open banking. Before wrapping up, I'd like to share an example of how we are incorporating our capabilities across all three strategic pillars. Our strategy to engage in the crypto economy leverages assets across payments, services, and new networks, a combination that yields a truly differentiated value proposition. Here, we're deploying our payment capabilities to enable consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and cash out their crypto wallets via Mastercard Send. This quarter, we partnered with Evonax, who will become our first partner in Australia to issue crypto-funded cards. We're enabling off-ramp solutions with Mastercard Send and recently added five new players in North America and Europe, including finance supported by checkout.com and Nubay. In all instances, we do not handle crypto but rather take delivery of fiat currency. Our services and new networks capabilities are providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants. Crypto Secure is an innovative solution designed to bring additional security and trust to this digital ecosystem by helping card issuers address regulatory risks. We also recognize the interest people continue to have in buying and holding crypto through trusted places like the banks, so last week we announced Crypto Source, which is designed to give our financial institution partners access to a comprehensive suite of buy, hold and sell services for select crypto assets. This will be augmented with our proven identity, cyber security and advisory services. To support these upcoming pilot programs, Mastercard is expanding its partnership with Paxos Trust Company to leverage their crypto asset trading and custody services. As you can see, our crypto strategy is bringing together best-in-class capabilities at scale all built on our core principles of providing strong consumer protections, safety and security.  In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth aided by a resilient consumer and a continued recovery in cross-border travel. We continue executing against our three strategic priorities. We have strong momentum with our customers, offering a diverse set of innovative solutions. We will continue to manage our expenses carefully within this macroeconomic environment, and our well diversified and flexible business model positions us well for the future. Sachin, over to you. Good morning Lisa, thank you for your questions. Let me kick off on that one.  You implied the answer in your question, actually - it is the nature of our continued diversification. Just to remind everybody on why are we diversifying, it is to give us a diversified revenue stream but it's also to differentiated our payments, and all of that plays hand-in-hand with better services. We're going to see more payment volumes come out with better services, easier to get into some of the new payment flows - for example, our safety security solutions are well sought after in the P2P space, where there is fraud issues all over the place. All that, I think is a good starting point for us. If I just look back over the last two years where we certainly had a slowdown on the payments side in the macroeconomic overall and services carried the day very significantly very for us, so we're just going to continue to push harder there. Then new flows, I gave you a whole range of examples earlier on how we are building out the new flows.  To just put some light onto commercial POS, this is existing tools that we have, we don't need to build a lot for it. It's a space that we haven't penetrated significantly in the past, and we are ready and we're going in. This is a $14 trillion opportunity that we are going after, which is payments diversification going on in addition to our services diversification. Earlier on, the stats on acceptance, just more places where people can spend, in the end people will spend even in a downturn. It doesn't actually matter for us what they spend on, but if they spend on a Mastercard, we give them more opportunities to do so, so diversification is the name of the game. Yes Darrin, I just want to add one point here, and that is looking back at the last two, two and a half years now, back to the second quarter of 2020 when revenue was severely impacted by a truly unprecedented event out there, so to the power of the levers that we have and the range of levers that we have to modulate our expenses - hiring, A&M, professional fees, T&E, market appetite and all of that, it just shows that we did not have to make any compromises when it comes to driving our strategic priorities. We pulled through on flows, we pulled through on services expansion and so forth. The model is wide and flexible - that helps us a lot, and as I look forward, there is optimism in how we're going to navigate that. Hi Harshita, thanks for the question. There's always something in debit routing going on, so here we have the clarification of the rule via the Fed. It takes all the way back to a decade ago, when there was this requirement to have two networks on every debit card, and basically what the Fed here clarified is that this is applying to whether it's a debit transaction that's made online or in stores, so pretty simple, pretty straightforward. Implementation by middle 2023, so we have some time, but we will be ready and we will be implementing. I think really what that does is we will just continue to compete with all the assets that we have in debit. I'm not really sure what this will do to the market, but we will certainly be there leveraging our technology to win more debit in the United States. Just one thing to add, this isn't exactly your question, but that whole space had been a focus for us pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and now. While airlines were struggling with really no flights taking off, we were a strong partner and it showed in how the engagement with airlines and travel-oriented portfolios work now, so we stand well positioned to benefit from the trends that Sachin just talked about, on the services side as well as in the payments and co-brand side, so exciting space. I think our bets are paying off. Rayna, let me start off on that. Latin America, fascinating region for us, highly diverse from super well developed Brazil to markets at the other end of the spectrum, high travel markets with the Caribbean, Mexico, so you have all of that in the mix. It's really interesting - when you peel the onion of it and you look at some of these markets and you compare them, two of the largest markets for example, Brazil and Mexico, if you look at the digital penetration in Mexico compared to Brazil, there is so much more potential to go, so there is upside in digitization. There is other issues that require some of our solutions. The region has experienced some fraud issues, generally in payments, so our safety and security solutions are in great demand and are a great driver for growth for us in the region while the underlying digitization continues, so you put those trends together, it's all fairly attractive. Then I talked to you about our engagement in the crypto economy. If there is one place in the world where crypto is really in focus, it's in that part of the world. Historic pain through high inflation and so forth, people were thinking crypto might be an answer. A lot of innovation in this space, so across all payments services and new payment flows and innovation, this is a region that has shown momentum for us. All right, let me take that. All Visa-related stuff, you should ask them, obviously, so I'm not going to do a direct comparison here, but I can tell you how we are thinking about it.  First of all, just earlier on I talked a lot about the crypto space. I'd just give you one example. Here is an interesting new technology and a growing ecosystem, and what's the way to get out of your crypto wallet balances is you turn it into fiat and you use Mastercard Send. We were right on this from the first day and we have all the partnerships that do exactly that. Then you go around and basically there is new flows, there is geographies, there is use cases, so those are the dimensions on how we are looking at this. We are very systematic about it. This has to have ubiquity. We're looking at all regions from a coverage perspective. We're looking at the key use cases. We're very selective of use cases because here, you could get lost in a thousand flowers bloom. The examples I gave to you on partnering with large global firms like AirBnB, that is the approach, where you're going to say you partner with somebody that is in all the regions and covers the use cases which matter to people out there.  That's essentially the approach on Mastercard Send. It has a domestic angle to it and it has a cross-border angle to it. It grows at significant rates, we're very happy with it across all of these aspects that I just said.  One thing to add - earlier we were talking about the numbers ex-Russia, so Russia was a huge success on Send from day one. That's in fact where a lot of our learnings came from. We exited Russia, as you know in March of this year, so that is skewing the numbers a little bit, but the learnings are not going away. We're putting that into a whole set of other markets, and to the earlier question around Europe, particularly in Europe we see some of those learnings translate in other parts of Eastern Europe countries and so forth. Right, so Andrew, thanks for that question. You know, starting with Europe but then we could extend this conversation looking at the Middle East or at Asia, so we have processing assets in those parts of the world. Just to illustrate how this matters, there is obviously a whole new set of players that are entering the payment space whose prime raison d'e\u0302tre isn't really to process, they want to have a great financial app, so they're looking downstream for a whole set of solutions that complete what they do, make it relatively easy out of one hand, and that's what we provide. This is really the explanation for some of our progress on the fintech side, on the neo-bank side. Those guys, where we have those partnerships, 70% win rate I'd like to add here, is really to a large extent coming down to our processing capabilities, which are state of the art, modern, fintech-oriented processing capabilities.  It's been a joy for us to watch. In some parts of the world, we are doing partnerships, for example with Network International in parts of Africa and so forth, so it's a combination of our own assets where we feel there is scale and differentiation, and sometimes it's through partners. Overall, there is a good play here in processing and it's one of the services that we have in our portfolio. Yes, and Sachin just kind of explained the strategy again, and that's what we're trying. We're trying to be in the payments transaction at profitable levels, but then use our services to continue to improve the overall revenue yield, and it's that combination that makes us look at the future very optimistically.  I don't really see anything changing here. These are the tools that we have, and we're using them effectively. Right, yes. I'm really not into baseball analogies, so that's why earlier I was talking about the first half of the game. But to your question very specifically, B2B, huge opportunity from a volume perspective. We called it out and we cut it down into very distinct types of flows at our investor day at the end of last year, so focus on B2B accounts payable on one hand, but there is other B2B flows which we're very active in. For example, through all the illustrations I gave you earlier on virtual card use cases, virtual card is the current and most immediate answer to go after B2B flows. There is the commercial POS piece somewhere, which is kind of in an in-between space between B2B and small business, but that's a huge space with a lot of cash and checks. You build it up over those into the accounts payable piece, and you know the long range vision that we have on accounts payable is really the Mastercard Track business payment service piece, where we say over time we're building a two-sided network here. That continues to grow, but that takes time. But we have large players around the table - HSBC, JP and so forth, so that's a good initiative for us, but for now, we are very active on virtual cards to solve the issues of buyers and suppliers in the space. We have not moved away from this by any stretch of the imagination. This is a huge opportunity and we're going to go after it. All right, let me bring the call to a close. Thank you for your questions, and to all of our investors, thank you for your support.  This morning I sent a note to our colleagues here at Mastercard thanking them for a strong quarter, because they are the ones who make all of this happen, so a shout-out to them as always. With that, we'll talk to you in the next quarter. Thank you very much."

Good morning, everyone. Starting with the key highlights for the quarter, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably, in cross-border travel.  Quarter two adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis excluding special items. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors that have both positive and negative influences on economic growth. Inflationary pressures have remained persistent and we are now seeing central banks taking even more aggressive steps to reduce inflation as we have seen in the Fed yesterday.  The situation is being compounded by geopolitical tensions and supply chain constraints, which has eased from pandemic peaks but remain in many industries. Despite this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising and consumer savings levels remain high. With this backdrop, consumer spending and particularly travel-related spending remains strong.  Looking at this from a geographic standpoint, U.S. retail spending remains healthy as consumers navigate a high inflation environment. Spending has been aided by strong job creation and the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our Mastercard spending pulse, which is based on all payment types including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales ex auto ex gas were up 6% in the second quarter versus a year ago. In Europe, spending trends are positive although the risks related to both the supply of natural gas and higher interest rates remain headwinds. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged a recovery of other regions. While COVID-related requirements have been relaxed in several countries, strong restrictions remain in others. Asia continues to have significant upside potential.  Looking more specifically at our switched volume trends. Domestic volumes continue to show strong growth with notable strength in airlines, lodging, and restaurant spend. We\u2019ve seen some shift in spends for the gas and groceries from discretionary categories like home furnishings in the U.S. Cross-border continues its strong recovery as border restrictions continue to be relaxed.  Cross-border travel in quarter two has now reached 118% of 2019 levels. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to hold up well.  Notwithstanding the strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely including fiscal and monetary policy responses to high inflation and their potential impacts on spending. Within this environment, we will continue to be nimble in managing our expenses. We have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers as we showed in 2020.  Having said this, we will continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom-line growth over the longer term. We have well-diversified business model and we are executing against our three key strategic priorities, expanding in payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And here is an update on how we are progressing against each one of those.  First, we are expanding in payments by continuing to grow card volume, driving acceptance growth and leaning into innovation to capture other prioritized payment flows. We are driving growth in card volume with new consumer, small business, co-brand and travel wins globally.  In Canada, we are excited to announce that we secured a new partnership with CIBC that creates an opportunity for material share shift of Mastercard with the Bank. We also renewed our relationship with the Royal Bank of Canada including a range of services that will enable us to grow our proprietary and co-brand volumes with them.  In the U.S., we established a new partnership agreement with the U.S. Bank, which extends our current debit, credit, co-brand and small business credit programs. It includes several new products including the first large-scale launch of a consumer credit product, a small business credit offering and the development of Buy Now Pay Later installment solutions.  We are excited to announce that we have completed the conversion of Gap Inc.\u2019s existing 10 million card members to Mastercard across the Old Navy Gap Banana Republic and Athleta brands. We renewed and expanded our co-brand with Brooks Brothers issued by Citi and we have renewed and expanded our co-brand with Barnes and Noble in partnership with Barclays.  Outside of North America, we have secured several new wins and renewals including a number of deals that position us well in Asia Pacific as the region rebounds from the pandemic. In Australia, we\u2019ve expanded our partnership with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, enabling us to maintain exclusivity with Bendigo and convert several of their regional debit portfolios.  We are pleased to announce that National Australia Bank and Mastercard has signed an agreement to retain and grow the Mastercard components of Citigroup Australia\u2019s consumer business that was acquired by NAB. This marks the first significant issuing relationship between the two companies in years and we look forward to partnering to grow these portfolios.  In Hong Kong, we partner with Citibank and HKT\u2019s loyalty program and digital ventures arm, The Club to launch the Citi The Club credit card.  In India, we are happy to report that the embargo on new issues has been lifted. Issuers have restarted card issuance and they are eager to expand business with us. An example is Yes Bank where we signed a consumer credit agreement that will enable us to maintain a majority share and includes the commitment to scale our World Elite portfolio.  We worked hard to expand our travel-oriented portfolios which positions us well to capitalize on the strong recovery of travel. For example, in Asia Pacific we entered into a ten year commercial card issuance deal with Trip.com, one of the world\u2019s largest online travel agency.  In the UAE, we renewed our co-brand portfolio with Marriott. In the U.S. we have renewed our longstanding co-brand relationship with Amtrak and we expanded our co-brand partnership with Virgin Atlantic in the UK, a partnership that will leverage our test and learn, innovation labs and SessionM loyalty assets.  We are also driving growth in payments by continuing to expand acceptance. Mastercard is now accepted at over 90 million merchant locations worldwide and we have more than doubled the number of acceptance locations over the last five years.  Mastercard has been driving tap on phone innovation enabling billions of active smartphones to become potential acceptance devices with over 130 deployments across 55 markets. This includes working with Apple to enable acceptance of Mastercard contactless cards and digital payments suited tap to pay on iPhone capability. This allows businesses to accept payments directly on their iPhones.  Mastercard is further empowering the ecosystem through our card commerce capabilities, which enables our channel partners to quickly deliver cost-effective acceptance. It also provides easy access to a range of payment solutions and services including tap on phone, QR, installments, loyalty, data insights and more via the Mastercard cloud.  In addition, we continue to drive adoption of our click to pay online guest checkout capability. Click to pay is now enabled in over 20 markets across all regions, attractions - transactions have been growing quarter-over-quarter.  We are expanding in payments through innovations like Mastercard Installments. Our open loop Buy Now Pay Later program has been very well received. Mastercard\u2019s Installment is now soon to be live with Saudi National Bank and several new partners adding their support to the program. Examples include, Cross River Bank, Evolve Bank & Trust, Jifiti, Live Oak, MOCA Financials, and Web Bank in the U.S., as well as HSBC, Natwest and JPMorgan\u2019s payments division in the UK. In addition, Apple recently announced Apple Pay Later, which uses the Mastercard Installments program.  Finally, we are driving growth in payments by leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows including disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, B2B accounts payable and consumer bill pay. This is at the heart of the investments we\u2019ve been making to develop a range of capabilities that span cards, account-to-account payments, push payments and blockchain.  We\u2019re at various stages of scaling our capabilities across these different flows and we are making steady progress. For example, we are expanding network reach through new cross-border services relationships with partners like Doha Bank and Vodafone in Qatar and UPT, a leading money transfer operator in Turkey. We are targeting specific use cases and scaling distribution through B2B partnerships with Mastercard Send. A few examples, Caesars Sportsbook will leverage Send for instant payment of online winnings and Paysafe will integrate Mastercard Send into their payments platform to enhance the payout capabilities offered to their merchant customers in the UK and the EU.  Now turning to services, our services capabilities have proven to be a tremendous growth driver and differentiator for our business, build on a foundation of investments and experiences built over the years. Looking forward, we continue to see a significant opportunity for services in three primary areas. First, services will continue to enhance the value of payments.  Services make payment intelligent, safe and secure. For example, our identity check payment authentication service is driving double-digit improvements in the approval rates. We are working with PostePay in Italy to support the deployment of their issuing portfolio, assist in growing their acquiring business and enhance the customer engagement approach.  And our consulting team in Europe is engaging with ING to help them create a seamless payment experience for their clients.  Second, we see the needs of our customers expanding beyond payments. We can leverage our full suite of differentiated services to address these needs. A recent example is Travelodge, was utilizing our Test & Learn capabilities to support optimization of new investments in their business.  And third, our services can be deployed to support new networks making our open banking and digital identity propositions even stronger. With these adjacent networks it is our services that will enable us to establish a differentiated position to scale and win. For example, we recently launched a new biometric checkout program. The program outlines a set of standards from banks, merchants and tech providers helping to ensure the security and privacy of personal data when people pay with a smile or with a wave.  Beyond expanding in payments and expanding in services our third key strategic priority area is embracing new networks. As a reminder, our current focus is on two areas, open banking and digital identity. We are leveraging our Finicity and IR acquisitions to expand our open banking footprint, grow our customer base and deliver new solutions. This quarter we expanded our engaged partner network to include our open banking services with new fin-tech partnerships, including Dwolla, Synctera, i2c and others.  They can now use our open banking capabilities to easily build and implement solutions for their end-customers across a range of use cases. From lending to payments, to financial management. In addition, we recently launched the global Start Path open banking program. This program enables us to co-innovate with start-up fintechs like Dapi, Finantier, mmob, Mono, and Paywallet as we support their path to scale.  We have expanded our open banking product offering as well. We announced pay by link in Europe to allows business to send payment request through invoice, email, SMS, or social media chat. This can expedite the payment of invoices in a cost-efficient way and aiding both parties to better manage cash flows.  Online accounting provider Visma Dinero is using pay by link to simplify invoice payments for over 75,000 small and medium-sized businesses.  And in the digital identity space, Ekata continues its strong performance signing over 200 new deals and expansion since we acquired the company just over one year ago. This includes many of the leading Buy Now Pay Later and crypto companies. It also includes real-time payment software providers like ECI Worldwide who is leveraging encompassed capabilities to help their global merchant network more accurately to identify fraudulent transactions.  Both in banking and digital identity are attractive and growing opportunities and Mastercard is uniquely positioned to be successful in both.  So in summary, our business fundamentals remain strong. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again. We are executing against our strategic priorities in payments, services and new networks. We have fortified our strong position with travel-oriented portfolios to capitalize on the continued recovery in travel.  On the macroeconomic fronts, we continue to monitor on a number of factors influencing economic and spending growth. And with all of that, we will continue to manage our expenses carefully. That said, we will also continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom-line growth over the longer term.  Sachin, over to you. \nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 27% reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed one ppt to this growth.  Operating expenses increased 12% including a five ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40% which includes a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 40% year-over-year to $2.56, which includes a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $448 million through July 25th, 2022. So, now let's turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 14% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 19%.  In the US, GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 25% reflecting the recovery of spending on travel. Debit declined by 2%. Excluding the impact of a roll off of a customer agreement, debit increased by 1%. Outside of the US, volume increased 16% with a credit growth of 19% and debit growth of 13%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border. Turning now to page five, Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding Russia from the prior year, Switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q2. Card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if you exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card comp. Globally there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's look to page six for the highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in services partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately two ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 13% while worldwide GDV grew 14%. Cross-border volume fees increased 16% while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The three ppt difference is primarily due to favorable geographic mix. Transaction processing fees were up 22% while switched transactions grew 12%. The ten ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix and FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 23% including a three ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 23% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Note, rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue is higher relative to Q1 2022 primarily due to volumes and related revenues generated from a sizable customer in Russia in Q1 with no related incentive agreement on such volumes.  Moving now to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 12% including a five ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign exchange related expenses due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.  Turning to page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of July. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, we have included an appendix later in this deck, we show all the data points from this schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in July.  Going forward however, the year-over-year growth metrics will face tougher comps as we begin lapping periods when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound.  Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switch volumes, for the first three weeks of July, we grew switch volumes 18% year-over-year, down three ppt versus Q2. Switch transactions grew 10% year-over-year through the first three weeks of July and down two ppt from Q2.  Overall cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of July grew 54% year-over-year, down four ppt versus Q2. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as border restrictions continue to be lifted. In the first three weeks of July, cross-border travel was up 89% year-over-year, down 55 ppt versus Q2 due to more difficult year ago comps as I just noted.  Cross-border travel is now at a 126% of 2019 levels, up eight points versus Q2. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel was up 16% year-over-year in July, the increase of 9 ppt compared to Q2, reflects a reduced headwind from crypto purchases and the timing of significant e-com promotional activity between the periods. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.  Turning to Page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that we have strong momentum with our customers, we continue to enhance our products and service offerings and that our business fundamentals remain very strong. Consumer spending remains robust, and cross-border travel has improved more quickly than expected as border restrictions ease and consumers increase their spending towards travel. And there is more room to prove as \u2013 borders remain either restricted or yet to recover to historical levels of growth.  For instance, based on our switched volumes, Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is only at approximately 60% of 2019 levels in Q2. Similarly, the U.S., UK and Canada, which represented approximately 20% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is at about 110% of 2019 levels, still well below the historical trajectory.  Specifically, if inbound travel to these three countries had continued to grow at the historical three-year CAGR through [Indiscernible] we would have expected to be at approximately 135% of 2019 levels rather than approximately 110%. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios.  As Michael mentioned, there are a number of macroeconomic factors that could influence future economic growth, employment and wage levels, consumer savings levels, persistent and elevated inflation and rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions in particular. We are monitoring each of these, but on balance, expect a modest improvement in cross-border travel versus 2019 levels and a generally resilient consumer spending through the remainder of 2022.  Taking this all into account, including our well-diversified business model, we are increasing our expectations for net revenue growth for the full year 2022 to a low 20s rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of five to six ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.  It is worth highlighting that this performance is despite the cessation of our Russia operations in Q1. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This reflects continued investment in our people and strategic priorities, as well as impacts from FX-related expenses primarily due to a remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.  Acquisitions are forecasted to add about four ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately three to four ppt for the year. We are prepared to quickly adjust our operating expense base as we did in 2020 should circumstances dictate. With respect to the third quarter of 2022, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high teens rate, again on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Sequentially, this reflects continued strong consumer spending, including a modest improvement in cross-border travel spending trends relative to 2019, reduced FX-related revenues as a result of lower anticipated FX volatility and finally, the lapping of a stronger year ago quarter as the recovery took hold last year.  Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately seven to eight ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expenses to grow at the high end of a low-double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items.  Acquisitions are forecast to add about five ppt to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately five ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics and finally, we expect a tax rate of between 19% and 21% in Q3, which includes a discrete tax item related to an unfavorable court judgment, the details of which we are still assessing. We expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.\nWarren Kneeshaw : Thank you, Sachin. Julie, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. So, Mike or Sachin, can you comment on the media reports yesterday that a potential bill for introducing routing choice for credit cards? I know the Durbin amendment for debit has market share, how could a credit routing choice, how could be implemented given many alternative networks don't have those capabilities?  And then finally, just taking a step back, can you talk about routing decisions for merchants that why they choose Mastercard or might choose Mastercard where they have a choice of alternatives? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Harshita, let me start off with that. This is \u2013 so we read the same article. Clearly, it's early stages because we haven't seen the bill yet. So we are all speculating here, I think what might happen. So we'll engage. We'll try to find out more over the weeks and months to come. But if you just assume for a moment that the article would be complete, and this would actually happen a few things come to mind that are straightforward from our perspective.  First of all, we believe in competition, we believe in a level of competitive landscape and playing field and we\u2019ve invested massive amounts in safety and security and we focus on providing consumer choice, different ways of pay, credit, debit, whatever it is. So that's been our strategy. So we are going to look at this proposal \u2013 proposed bill through that end.  So that's one \u2013 that's a starting point for us. Some of the questions that you touched on, some points here. What are practicalities, what are the technical aspects of this, how many providers are ready that have made the same kind of investments to really ensure that the consumer can rely on safety and protection and so forth. Those are open questions. We'll have to see what the regulation actually foresees.  Overall, the concept of interchange is a balancing factor and the ecosystem is one that has served the ecosystem including the consumers well in terms of rich propositions and all of that and we'll have to see what \u2013 becomes out of that. Those are a whole range of questions that we've talked about over years that need to be considered by all stakeholders. And we will spend the time and the effort to ensure that everybody is well informed about the puts and takes around this proposed bill.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you. \nWarren Kneeshaw: Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. \nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Sachin, you talked about what's being baked into your forward view on cross-border being a modest improvement in cross-border, but you talked also about the long runway you still believe you have in terms of cross-border. Could you just help us think about what's factored in versus what practically can happen as we look forward? Thanks. \nSachin Mehra : Sure, Sanjay. So, what I shared was that we are thinking ahead in terms of cross-border travel seeing a modest improvement relative to 2019. And as you can see in our metrics, cross-border travel in Q2 was at a 118%. And in the first three weeks of July is at 126%. Without getting too specific as to what exactly we are kind of building in that, but that the point we've got is the following: we expect a modest improvement in travel when indexed back to 2019, and it's predicated on certain data points.  And the data points are, if you think about what's gone on in Asia Pacific, we've talked about how Asia Pacific from a cross-border travel standpoint has been lagging and has historically not come back over the last few years since COVID hit in the same way, say, as intra-Europe has come back. In fact, I shared with you the metrics as to where we stand from an inbound cross-border travel standpoint in Asia Pacific.  So there is a lot of room to grow there. We think that that opportunity exists. Markets in Asia Pacific, such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, even Japan, they've started to open up and actually have opened up fairly well. The one thing which we have always taken comfort in is that the fundamentals of cross-border travel and on cross-border in total remain very sound.  When people have the ability to travel, they have demonstrated their intent to travel. And I think we've got enough data points now over the last 18 months to suggest that when barriers towards travel are lifted, people get on the road again. And so if you think about that and you think about the context of what's going on in Asia and the potential there, we've got opportunity there. But even beyond Asia, there are several other corridors such as the U.S., UK and Canada, which still have not reached their historical growth levels. They are higher than their 2019 index levels from an inbound standpoint but there is still more room to grow. So we've kind of built all of that in our thoughts for the rest of the year.\nMichael Miebach : I'd like to just add to that, I find travel is such a fascinating topic and certainly very central to our business. There has been a [Indiscernible] of pent-up demand like this is going to be a bubble and then it's all going to go back to where it was during the last two years. Why would anybody that has now has the chance to see their family and their friends again stop doing that in a year from now.  So I think that actually doesn't make any sense. So we believe exactly the point that Sachin just made, if there is a possibility people will continue to travel the way they have been before COVID. One other thing to add is, one thing is the underlying trend that we have built in our outlook on the data points that Sachin just talked about, but it's also to strengthen our position vis-a-vis that travel trend.  All the portfolios, we talked to you about American Airlines, about JetBlue, about Cathay Pacific, everything that we have won in the last two years is going to really come to bear to really make the most of this.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rayna Kumar from UBS. Please go ahead. \nRayna Kumar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. During the 2008, 2009 recession, Mastercard generated solid revenue and earnings growth and I'm curious to know what you think has changed the most about Mastercard since then, that could help you generate positive results through another potential economic downturn, even if you're not seeing it right now. Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Right, Rayna. I think the last word, as you said, is instructive as we are not seeing it right now, generally resilient consumer spending for the time being and we talked about the modest improvement in cross-border and same - spending behaviors until the end of last year. Now you're taking us really a long time back in 2008 and 2009.  I think the first thing I would say is it's a very different scenario. A scenario that we're looking at externally, that I come to the company in a moment, externally is we are not having a crisis around unemployment. We're having high consumer spending levels. So we don't have an asset bubble that looks anything similar than what we've seen at that time.  So a different starting point. I would say it's a somewhat more benign starting point than we had at that time. Now the company also looks entirely different than it looked in 2008 and 2009. It's a much more diversified business. It's a highly diversified business. I think we were largely consumer credit debit oriented at the time.  We have a whole range of card-based spending from push payments into general payments for goods and services, opening up new verticals and so forth and then there is our progress into new flows. So that gives us resilience on underlying payments. It also \u2013 our reach of our business model and how many payment transactions we touch that allow us to build a set of service on it looks entirely different.  Our switching ratios at that time were much, much lower than they are today, which has led to a very successful services business, which we have seen in the last two years is actually quite resilient when you go into \u2013 through up and down cycles. And as we continue to build into the future to see whenever we might face a down cycle, are we more resilient with other activities around digital identity and open banking and so forth that go into a world of open banking and move even further before or after the payment transaction to give us more resilience.  So, better earnings quality, higher diversification and we've been tested. We've been tested over the last two years. I mean there was a down cycle and we needed to demonstrate agility and the speed and managing our expenses, make the right investment decisions. So we feel we're well positioned to navigate what's going to \u2013 whatever is going to come. Hopefully, it's positive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nDarrin Peller : Thanks guys. What's the investment that makes services to continue to pay off and I think to your point, it underscores that your customer base is still really spend on some of those areas. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in terms of the strength there and what kind of resilience you'd expect those to have in different economic scenarios?  And then, Sachin, just one quick one on processing yields. It came in a lot better than our estimated relative to transaction growth, processing revenue line up. You mentioned pricing other variables. Can you just talk about sustainable spread? Thanks guys.\nSachin Mehra : Yes. Darrin, happy to take the second question first. I must say you were breaking up on the first part of your question, so we might ask you to just \u2013 kind of state that again. But on your second part of the question, what you are seeing in transaction processing growth rates relative to the growth in switch transactions is exactly like I said, the thee things kind of going on there, right?  The favorable mix piece, which I talked about, the higher FX-related revenues and then there is some elements of pricing. Look, I mean, the reality is we're operating in an environment in which you've seen a few things happen. One is the mix has shifted towards a more cross-border and you know we make cross-border fees both in the cross-border volume fees line, as well as in switch transactions.  So, sometimes that's kind of an overlooked element, but that's an important piece to keep in mind that we do make cross-border fees on the transaction processing line. And as the shift has gone towards more cross-border, that's helped us. Number two is, there is high levels of volatility in the foreign exchange markets.  We delivered some very important services when we do switching of transactions and when we do the settlement of those transactions. In a highly volatile FX environment, it's actually worked in our favor. And on pricing, the baseline is the following, which is at the end of the day, we continue to deliver value to the ecosystem. And as we put value out into the ecosystem, we price for that value.  And what you're seeing there is exactly that come through, which is, we are reflecting that in the nature of pricing. You'll see puts and takes in different quarters in terms of what we may or may not do in terms of pricing, depending on what we believe is the value we're delivering, as well as what the market's appetite to accept that is, and that's what you're seeing through there.\nDarrin Peller : Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nMichael Miebach : Could you repeat your first question?\nSachin Mehra : Yes, that's much better.\nDarrin Peller : Yeah, thanks. I was just trying to figure out the value-added services, the new flows, all the areas that are driving other revenues, obviously, are continuing to trend very well. And I mean, if you could just revisit what do you think are the top two or three drivers there? And what kind of sustainability in different macro scenarios you'd expect for that? Just it looks like the investments you made there are clearly paying off. Think we're just wondering on the cyclicality of this. Thanks again guys.\nMichael Miebach : Alright. Good. So, what we're seeing here is, first of all, on the backdrop, let's just pick up on the structural changes, again, that we have seen over the last two years. Clearly driven by social distancing measures are up a significant push into more digital engagement by consumers. They were sitting at home, so all that. It's a more digital world.  So here, services that helped make a more digital world safer and more easily understood. That's really the general thrust of what's driving the growth and the interest from our customers across established customer sets, as well as new ones earlier, I talked about travel watches. People come to us and say, hey, I want to use all of that data to get a better understanding of my business. So, taking it one-by-one, safety security, anything in the fraud space and in the authentication space has been a joy for us. You go further into cyber risk assessments. Our small business is safe.  Those many small businesses that have opened up in a more digital fashion now over the last two years and you go all the way into digital identity because in a more digital world, people find to have more passwords and nobody wants \u2013 really wants that. So digital identity is now a solution that's really taking hold. So that's that whole space.  And you saw us \u2013 actually doesn't stop at current types of payments. So the last thing I should add is our acquisition of CipherTrace and how we are going into the crypto space, making that safer as that is certainly something that captures consumers' interests, one space.  The second piece is what do you do with all of that data, retail and commerce, travel logic, I give you one example, many other customers are trying to understand how to make \u2013 run their business better using the payments data that is thrown off and we helped them with that. Our Dynamic Yield acquisition is one of them, where we help customers, retail and commerce customers engage their customers, their end customers in a more targeted fashion.  I imagine a landing page that now has personalized offers. In our case, always with strong consent from consumers and a focus on data privacy. So those are the two headlines. We do various other things and services from consulting into processing-related activities and so forth, but that's centered across.\nSachin Mehra : And Darrin, I'll just add as it relates to how we see the other revenue line item and services, in particular to what Michael was talking about, look, we see really good demand from the customers, and we see good growth potential there. The reality is we are doing deeper penetration of those services with our existing customer base.  We're expanding the set of services we've got across our customer base and the third element, we're actually taking those same services and moving across to the new network side of things as well. And Michael alluded to one part of that when he was talking about what we do in the CipherTrace, but more broadly, even in open banking, for example.  So the potential is there and we do expect that given the suite of services we've got, there is good growth potential going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nLisa Ellis : Alright. Good morning. Thanks guys. Good stuff here. I wanted to ask a question about some of the news related recently to the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau looking into stand-alone service providers, both in the P2P space. So, meaning the fraud issues we've seen in Zelle and other private P2P services and then also on the BNPL side, looking at the stand-alone providers there with the marketing and kind of risk management that they are doing.  Can you just comment on how Mastercard is kind of positioned relative to the areas they are looking into? Is this an opportunity for Mastercard to perhaps play a larger role with Mastercard Send in P2P and with MasterCard Installments in the NPL? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Thank you, Lisa. So let me start off on that. Where the consumer protection agency here in the U.S. and some other markets are going is really to ensure that there is the right kind of protections for consumers that goes all the way from responsible lending to safety, security and so forth.  We follow that. But if I look just in-house and see what we are doing, if I look at our data principles, what we have done around the Mastercard Installments program to ensure that the participating lenders go through a vetting process and follow responsible lending rules that we have set as part of our franchise, we feel well positioned.  I feel we are a good industry custodian to ensure that these responsible practices are being held around. Now is that also an opportunity for us in all of this? Absolutely. We have learned to partner with P2P systems in many countries around the world with safety and security solutions. The services I actually just talked about when we say, hey, you have a fraud issue, we get it.  Here's a set of answers that we have for you to partner and in other markets, we compete head-on because we simply believe we have the better solution and players not necessarily always want to partner with us. So it's a bit of a mix, give and take, but it's an interesting and dynamic field that we are very focused on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nTien-Tsin Huang : Hey. Thank you so much. Thanks for going through all of this. I heard the CBIC when \u2013 I am just curious how deal activity is going? Are the known conversions that you have proceeding in a timely way? I don't know if there's been any change given some of the macro uncertainty there?  And then also Sachin, would you mind just rehashing the FX-neutral OpEx numbers again? Are you changing your underlying investment strategy or inflation assumptions given what we've learned around the macro? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Tien-Tsin, let me start off with the deal activity. The momentum that we have seen over the last two years throughout the pandemic, where we lean with our customers and say, hey, what do you need and these are tough times? I think we set ourselves up as a trusted partner and help to shape that deal pipeline that we currently see, which is very strong.  Deal pipeline is strong across all regions and we gave you a few examples today from \u2013 we haven't talked much about Canada lately. So these are strong wins. This is excellent. Some of the very significant wins we talked about over a year ago in Europe when you think about NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the multi-regional deal that we have with Santander, they are progressing according to plan.  The conversions are going on. I mentioned very specifically back to United States. The GAP conversion is actually done on those 10 million cards. So overall, we talked to you at the Investor Day in November last year that we see share growth across all of our carded products and we continue to feel very good about that.  So momentum, it's competitive out there, of course. But I think the mix of what we have in various payment solutions, as well as services sets us apart. We've also relooked at how we deploy our sales resources across the company with all the acquisitions that we have so that we can do the best possible work for our customers. So overall, strong momentum that I think will continue.\nSachin Mehra : Yes, Tien-Tsin, on your question as it relates to the outlook for the full year 2022 on OpEx, so, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, we are guiding along the following lines, which is on OpEx that we expect to come in on a full year basis at the low end of the low-double-digits range.  And just to remind you on what we're talking about OpEx on the revenue side, also, we have changed our full year guide and our revenue, again, on a non-GAAP growth basis, currency-neutral, excluding acquisitions, is now at the low 20s rate, which is higher than what we had shared with you previously.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Please go ahead. \nDavid Togut : Thank you. good morning. Among your largest geographic regions, Europe continues to generate the greatest payment volume outperformance versus our model. You underscored a number of geopolitical and economic risks for Europe. Going forward, especially as we head into the winter, can you talk through Mastercard's growth algorithm, what that might look like in a significant economic slowdown in Europe?  Historically, you've been a big share gainer there, particularly against the national payment networks. You've got the secular shift working in your favor, but, if you could just kind of talk through your thought process, that would be much appreciated.\nMichael Miebach : Alright, let me start, and then Sachin can chime in. So David, as a matter of fact is Europe is not homogenous. That's the first thing I would say. When you look at where we are on the arc of the secular shift, it's very different. So there is lots of opportunity across the board from further digitization. The opportunity to go beyond P2M and sets of flows is wide open in Europe.  The push of the European authorities to digitize beyond just in-store payments and online payments is significantly there. We are well-positioned with our tools in Europe, which is pushing on open banking, which is pushing on open on account-to-account, which is pushing bill pay solutions. So we have all of that in a hop. So we feel that there is significant opportunity. And as I said before, there is uncertainty on the European macroeconomic front. But on the other hand, macroeconomic GDP overall economy and our baskets are two different things, and we'll have to kind of see how that will play out. I can't really predict that. I am from there, so I have a sense, but I am not in the business of predictions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ramzey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. \nRamsey El-Assal : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I had wanted to ask about some of the longer term drivers of rebates and incentives. It seems like today or not it seems like today, rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues are several hundred basis points higher than they were in 2019. I guess the question is, is the mix and the mix-related drivers of that increase are very clear.  But as we move forward over the next couple of years and your mix normalizes, should we see downward pressure on the rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues? Or is this something where this new baseline is sort of here to stay? And if that's the case, maybe give us some reasons why?\nSachin Mehra : Sure. So Ramzey, I'll take that one. So, look, I mean, I think you're well aware about the fact that rebates and incentives are influenced by a number of factors, right? Some of which you alluded to, which is what's going on from a volume growth rate, what's going on from a mix standpoint, how the pipeline of new deals are looking, you take all of that into consideration.  But the reality is, if you just think about where we are from a mix standpoint, particularly on cross-border between where we were pre-pandemic and where we are today, we've still not gone back to the historical mix levels from a cross-border to domestic volume standpoint. So as that reverts back to the mean and when I say the mean, means closer to what the pre-pandemic levels where you would expect to see some benefit of that come through in rebates and incentives versus growth - as a percentage of growth, you would see that come through.  But the reality is there are other countervailing factors which are also taking place, right, which is a function of what the pipeline of deals looks like, what the timing around that is, but \u2013 the basic premise is correct, which is as more cross-border happens, you're going to see a benefit come through in rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth.\nRamsey El-Assal : Got it. Thank you so much. Appreciated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan [Indiscernible] from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a clarification, Sachin, on the OpEx, the non-GAAP growth, currency-neutral ex acquisitions that went up from high-single-digits originally. I think it was last quarter that you guided to that for the year to low end of low-double-digits. So, I guess, why the increase in OpEx?  And is it just taking the opportunity to invest more due to the strength of the topline but any color maybe on where some of those investments might be going with the additional expense? Thanks. \nSachin Mehra : Sure, Bryan. So a couple of things which are \u2013 you're right. We had previously guided to high-single-digits and now are guiding to low end of low-double-digits on this non-GAAP metric on OpEx. Couple of things going on.  One is we have taken foreign exchange-related losses on the remeasurement of our assets and liabilities during the first two quarters, order of magnitude about $70 million and you'll see all of this in our reports, which we've kind of publicly put out there. So that's certainly impacting it. And then a couple of other things which, to me, are more critical, which is we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, that which includes investing in our people.  In a hot talent market, we want to make sure we've got the best people. We want to be there. In terms of having those best people help us execute on what we've laid out as our strategic priorities, which is what we're doing right here. We've always kind of followed the philosophy of let's keep an eye on the top-line and then kind of pulse as to what we want to do from an expense and investment standpoint and that's the philosophy we're following. We'll continue to follow that philosophy going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. \nDavid Koning : Yeah. Hey guys. Thanks so much. And I guess my question is on cross-border yields. One thing that was interesting this quarter, intra-Europe cross-border grew faster than non-intra-Europe for the first time in a long time and yield was up regardless. So it seems like the last few quarters, mix helped a lot, but now there it seems like another driver on top.  I guess is that right? Maybe what's that other driver? And should we get faster growth in non-intra-Europe kind of in coming quarters?\nSachin Mehra : Sure, David. So you are right in terms of what the mix shift between inter and intra was this quarter versus last quarter. I think there are a few things to keep in mind. That's the mix shift between inter and intra. But there's also within the world of inter what are the corridors, which are coming back versus the corridors which have not come back, right?  And as you started to see more of the higher-yielding corridors come back, that's actually helping us in providing us the tailwind we are talking about right here. So, for example, you've got markets \u2013 it\u2019s like inbound into the U.S. as that starts to come back, you start to see the benefit of that come through markets like Asia, inbound into Asia, you'll start to see the benefit of that come through. \nDavid Koning : Yeah. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. Wanted to get your perspective on just the relative health of the lower-income consumer versus higher income? And then, if you can just make some remarks about how we should think about rebates and incentives for Q3 and Q4? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra : Sure, Jason. So, on your first question, here is what we're seeing actually. Overall, the consumer and consumer spending patterns are very healthy. And again, you've got to parse this data out between what we see in the U.S. versus what we see in the rest of the world, right? And different people have different definitions on what is lower income versus what is the affluent.  But let's just start kind of that as the frame. In the U.S., what you are seeing is, good strength across both, but a declining trend in terms of the growth rates on the lower income side of things. Affluent spend continues to be very healthy and carries on in a very nice way. Outside of the U.S., we are not seeing much in the nature of a shift between now, the affluent category spending versus what the lower income category spending.  So the benefits of what we've got in Mastercard by being a diversified business and being diversified from a geographical standpoint is actually helping us very nicely because independent of what happens in one market versus the other, the value of what we got across the globe comes through in terms of spend levels here And then your second question was around rebates and incentives. Look, I just talked about things which influence revising incentives. So I won't kind of belabor that point. What I'll share with you is the following that we expect that incentives as a percentage of growth will be roughly similar in Q3 to what we saw in Q2.\nJason Kupferberg : Thank you.\nSachin Mehra : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nBob Napoli : Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a lot of your comments on the open banking, digital ID and your investments there. Can you maybe give some color on what you feel like the revenue TAM is for those businesses? And what type of \u2013 where you see the most opportunity, what the kind of the growth trajectory is of those businesses? \nMichael Miebach : Right. So open banking, let me start off more generally speaking. So clearly, a global trend, one that's to stay. It's happening in Brazil. It's happening in Australia, certainly was there in the United States and Europe. The way we approach it is, first of all, we have a relevant position in connectivity and then building out a bunch of use cases.  And the use cases that would get really to the heart of your question, you see very different types of kind of revenue models, value exchange models. First of all, on connectivity itself, you have per API call kind of logic. If you go into financial management solutions and it depends on who's our customer here, let's say it's a fintech that could again be by API.  But you could start to see as we go into lending, mortgage verification, asset verification, kind of use cases. Those are kind of \u2013 that's the broad range of currently what we're seeing no established model at this point in time. I mean, we are investing heavily Aiia, Finicity because we feel there is a tremendous opportunity.  This is \u2013 it's going to help to pull so many new customers into \u2013 consumers into the ecosystem, on the financial inclusion side, on the SME side and so forth. So, hard to answer very specifically right now where we are, but those are those kind of different kind of models and it's going to be multi-geography and it's going to be here around to stay.\nSachin Mehra : And I'll just add to that a couple of thoughts. One, I think defining any sort of TAM in open banking at this point in time will just be an incorrect. We'll be looking for precision where it doesn't exist because use cases are still to develop. So I think, what we see is tremendous potential with what Open Banking does by providing us access to an alternative network. It's a data network, which comes with its own sets of use cases.  The second point I'll bring out is regardless of whether it's open banking or digital ID or all of our services. We think about that in the context of the revenues they generate for Mastercard, the company, but it's really important to remember that all of this is one big circular wheel. Our open banking assets power our payments, our services power our payments. So there is the collateral advantage, which comes through by virtue and being in all of these spaces, which trickles down to all parts of our business.\nBob Napoli : Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Alright. Thank you. So much for that last question, exciting space. We are going to close the call now. We are at the top of the hour. Appreciate your time this morning. Do want to thank our 24,000 colleagues around the world and I want to thank all of you who have joined us today for your continued support for Mastercard. Talk to you in a quarter. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 27% reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed one ppt to this growth.  Operating expenses increased 12% including a five ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40% which includes a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 40% year-over-year to $2.56, which includes a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $448 million through July 25th, 2022. So, now let's turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 14% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 19%.  In the US, GDV increased by 10% with credit growth of 25% reflecting the recovery of spending on travel. Debit declined by 2%. Excluding the impact of a roll off of a customer agreement, debit increased by 1%. Outside of the US, volume increased 16% with a credit growth of 19% and debit growth of 13%. Cross-border volume was up 58% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border. Turning now to page five, Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding Russia from the prior year, Switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q2. Card present and card not present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if you exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card comp. Globally there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's look to page six for the highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in services partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately two ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments were up 13% while worldwide GDV grew 14%. Cross-border volume fees increased 16% while cross-border volumes increased 58%. The three ppt difference is primarily due to favorable geographic mix. Transaction processing fees were up 22% while switched transactions grew 12%. The ten ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix and FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 23% including a three ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 23% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Note, rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue is higher relative to Q1 2022 primarily due to volumes and related revenues generated from a sizable customer in Russia in Q1 with no related incentive agreement on such volumes.  Moving now to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 12% including a five ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as unfavorable foreign exchange related expenses due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.  Turning to page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of July. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, we have included an appendix later in this deck, we show all the data points from this schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in July.  Going forward however, the year-over-year growth metrics will face tougher comps as we begin lapping periods when COVID-related restrictions eased and spending levels started to rebound.  Going through the metrics in turn, starting with switch volumes, for the first three weeks of July, we grew switch volumes 18% year-over-year, down three ppt versus Q2. Switch transactions grew 10% year-over-year through the first three weeks of July and down two ppt from Q2.  Overall cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of July grew 54% year-over-year, down four ppt versus Q2. Cross-border travel had another quarter of strong growth as border restrictions continue to be lifted. In the first three weeks of July, cross-border travel was up 89% year-over-year, down 55 ppt versus Q2 due to more difficult year ago comps as I just noted.  Cross-border travel is now at a 126% of 2019 levels, up eight points versus Q2. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel was up 16% year-over-year in July, the increase of 9 ppt compared to Q2, reflects a reduced headwind from crypto purchases and the timing of significant e-com promotional activity between the periods. This metric continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels.  Turning to Page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that we have strong momentum with our customers, we continue to enhance our products and service offerings and that our business fundamentals remain very strong. Consumer spending remains robust, and cross-border travel has improved more quickly than expected as border restrictions ease and consumers increase their spending towards travel. And there is more room to prove as \u2013 borders remain either restricted or yet to recover to historical levels of growth.  For instance, based on our switched volumes, Asia, which represented approximately 14% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is only at approximately 60% of 2019 levels in Q2. Similarly, the U.S., UK and Canada, which represented approximately 20% of cross-border inbound travel in 2019 is at about 110% of 2019 levels, still well below the historical trajectory.  Specifically, if inbound travel to these three countries had continued to grow at the historical three-year CAGR through [Indiscernible] we would have expected to be at approximately 135% of 2019 levels rather than approximately 110%. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios.  As Michael mentioned, there are a number of macroeconomic factors that could influence future economic growth, employment and wage levels, consumer savings levels, persistent and elevated inflation and rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions in particular. We are monitoring each of these, but on balance, expect a modest improvement in cross-border travel versus 2019 levels and a generally resilient consumer spending through the remainder of 2022.  Taking this all into account, including our well-diversified business model, we are increasing our expectations for net revenue growth for the full year 2022 to a low 20s rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of five to six ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro.  It is worth highlighting that this performance is despite the cessation of our Russia operations in Q1. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the low end of a low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This reflects continued investment in our people and strategic priorities, as well as impacts from FX-related expenses primarily due to a remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.  Acquisitions are forecasted to add about four ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately three to four ppt for the year. We are prepared to quickly adjust our operating expense base as we did in 2020 should circumstances dictate. With respect to the third quarter of 2022, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high teens rate, again on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Sequentially, this reflects continued strong consumer spending, including a modest improvement in cross-border travel spending trends relative to 2019, reduced FX-related revenues as a result of lower anticipated FX volatility and finally, the lapping of a stronger year ago quarter as the recovery took hold last year.  Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately seven to eight ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expenses to grow at the high end of a low-double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items.  Acquisitions are forecast to add about five ppt to this growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately five ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics and finally, we expect a tax rate of between 19% and 21% in Q3, which includes a discrete tax item related to an unfavorable court judgment, the details of which we are still assessing. We expect a tax rate of approximately 19% in Q4. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Sure, Sanjay. So, what I shared was that we are thinking ahead in terms of cross-border travel seeing a modest improvement relative to 2019. And as you can see in our metrics, cross-border travel in Q2 was at a 118%. And in the first three weeks of July is at 126%. Without getting too specific as to what exactly we are kind of building in that, but that the point we've got is the following: we expect a modest improvement in travel when indexed back to 2019, and it's predicated on certain data points.  And the data points are, if you think about what's gone on in Asia Pacific, we've talked about how Asia Pacific from a cross-border travel standpoint has been lagging and has historically not come back over the last few years since COVID hit in the same way, say, as intra-Europe has come back. In fact, I shared with you the metrics as to where we stand from an inbound cross-border travel standpoint in Asia Pacific.  So there is a lot of room to grow there. We think that that opportunity exists. Markets in Asia Pacific, such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, even Japan, they've started to open up and actually have opened up fairly well. The one thing which we have always taken comfort in is that the fundamentals of cross-border travel and on cross-border in total remain very sound.  When people have the ability to travel, they have demonstrated their intent to travel. And I think we've got enough data points now over the last 18 months to suggest that when barriers towards travel are lifted, people get on the road again. And so if you think about that and you think about the context of what's going on in Asia and the potential there, we've got opportunity there. But even beyond Asia, there are several other corridors such as the U.S., UK and Canada, which still have not reached their historical growth levels. They are higher than their 2019 index levels from an inbound standpoint but there is still more room to grow. So we've kind of built all of that in our thoughts for the rest of the year. Yes. Darrin, happy to take the second question first. I must say you were breaking up on the first part of your question, so we might ask you to just \u2013 kind of state that again. But on your second part of the question, what you are seeing in transaction processing growth rates relative to the growth in switch transactions is exactly like I said, the thee things kind of going on there, right?  The favorable mix piece, which I talked about, the higher FX-related revenues and then there is some elements of pricing. Look, I mean, the reality is we're operating in an environment in which you've seen a few things happen. One is the mix has shifted towards a more cross-border and you know we make cross-border fees both in the cross-border volume fees line, as well as in switch transactions.  So, sometimes that's kind of an overlooked element, but that's an important piece to keep in mind that we do make cross-border fees on the transaction processing line. And as the shift has gone towards more cross-border, that's helped us. Number two is, there is high levels of volatility in the foreign exchange markets.  We delivered some very important services when we do switching of transactions and when we do the settlement of those transactions. In a highly volatile FX environment, it's actually worked in our favor. And on pricing, the baseline is the following, which is at the end of the day, we continue to deliver value to the ecosystem. And as we put value out into the ecosystem, we price for that value.  And what you're seeing there is exactly that come through, which is, we are reflecting that in the nature of pricing. You'll see puts and takes in different quarters in terms of what we may or may not do in terms of pricing, depending on what we believe is the value we're delivering, as well as what the market's appetite to accept that is, and that's what you're seeing through there. Yes, that's much better. And Darrin, I'll just add as it relates to how we see the other revenue line item and services, in particular to what Michael was talking about, look, we see really good demand from the customers, and we see good growth potential there. The reality is we are doing deeper penetration of those services with our existing customer base.  We're expanding the set of services we've got across our customer base and the third element, we're actually taking those same services and moving across to the new network side of things as well. And Michael alluded to one part of that when he was talking about what we do in the CipherTrace, but more broadly, even in open banking, for example.  So the potential is there and we do expect that given the suite of services we've got, there is good growth potential going forward. Yes, Tien-Tsin, on your question as it relates to the outlook for the full year 2022 on OpEx, so, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, we are guiding along the following lines, which is on OpEx that we expect to come in on a full year basis at the low end of the low-double-digits range.  And just to remind you on what we're talking about OpEx on the revenue side, also, we have changed our full year guide and our revenue, again, on a non-GAAP growth basis, currency-neutral, excluding acquisitions, is now at the low 20s rate, which is higher than what we had shared with you previously. Sure. So Ramzey, I'll take that one. So, look, I mean, I think you're well aware about the fact that rebates and incentives are influenced by a number of factors, right? Some of which you alluded to, which is what's going on from a volume growth rate, what's going on from a mix standpoint, how the pipeline of new deals are looking, you take all of that into consideration.  But the reality is, if you just think about where we are from a mix standpoint, particularly on cross-border between where we were pre-pandemic and where we are today, we've still not gone back to the historical mix levels from a cross-border to domestic volume standpoint. So as that reverts back to the mean and when I say the mean, means closer to what the pre-pandemic levels where you would expect to see some benefit of that come through in rebates and incentives versus growth - as a percentage of growth, you would see that come through.  But the reality is there are other countervailing factors which are also taking place, right, which is a function of what the pipeline of deals looks like, what the timing around that is, but \u2013 the basic premise is correct, which is as more cross-border happens, you're going to see a benefit come through in rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth. Sure, Bryan. So a couple of things which are \u2013 you're right. We had previously guided to high-single-digits and now are guiding to low end of low-double-digits on this non-GAAP metric on OpEx. Couple of things going on.  One is we have taken foreign exchange-related losses on the remeasurement of our assets and liabilities during the first two quarters, order of magnitude about $70 million and you'll see all of this in our reports, which we've kind of publicly put out there. So that's certainly impacting it. And then a couple of other things which, to me, are more critical, which is we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, that which includes investing in our people.  In a hot talent market, we want to make sure we've got the best people. We want to be there. In terms of having those best people help us execute on what we've laid out as our strategic priorities, which is what we're doing right here. We've always kind of followed the philosophy of let's keep an eye on the top-line and then kind of pulse as to what we want to do from an expense and investment standpoint and that's the philosophy we're following. We'll continue to follow that philosophy going forward. Sure, David. So you are right in terms of what the mix shift between inter and intra was this quarter versus last quarter. I think there are a few things to keep in mind. That's the mix shift between inter and intra. But there's also within the world of inter what are the corridors, which are coming back versus the corridors which have not come back, right?  And as you started to see more of the higher-yielding corridors come back, that's actually helping us in providing us the tailwind we are talking about right here. So, for example, you've got markets \u2013 it's like inbound into the U.S. as that starts to come back, you start to see the benefit of that come through markets like Asia, inbound into Asia, you'll start to see the benefit of that come through. Sure, Jason. So, on your first question, here is what we're seeing actually. Overall, the consumer and consumer spending patterns are very healthy. And again, you've got to parse this data out between what we see in the U.S. versus what we see in the rest of the world, right? And different people have different definitions on what is lower income versus what is the affluent.  But let's just start kind of that as the frame. In the U.S., what you are seeing is, good strength across both, but a declining trend in terms of the growth rates on the lower income side of things. Affluent spend continues to be very healthy and carries on in a very nice way. Outside of the U.S., we are not seeing much in the nature of a shift between now, the affluent category spending versus what the lower income category spending.  So the benefits of what we've got in Mastercard by being a diversified business and being diversified from a geographical standpoint is actually helping us very nicely because independent of what happens in one market versus the other, the value of what we got across the globe comes through in terms of spend levels here And then your second question was around rebates and incentives. Look, I just talked about things which influence revising incentives. So I won't kind of belabor that point. What I'll share with you is the following that we expect that incentives as a percentage of growth will be roughly similar in Q3 to what we saw in Q2. Sure. And I'll just add to that a couple of thoughts. One, I think defining any sort of TAM in open banking at this point in time will just be an incorrect. We'll be looking for precision where it doesn't exist because use cases are still to develop. So I think, what we see is tremendous potential with what Open Banking does by providing us access to an alternative network. It's a data network, which comes with its own sets of use cases.  The second point I'll bring out is regardless of whether it's open banking or digital ID or all of our services. We think about that in the context of the revenues they generate for Mastercard, the company, but it's really important to remember that all of this is one big circular wheel. Our open banking assets power our payments, our services power our payments. So there is the collateral advantage, which comes through by virtue and being in all of these spaces, which trickles down to all parts of our business."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Starting with the key highlights for the quarter, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably, in cross-border travel.  Quarter two adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis excluding special items. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors that have both positive and negative influences on economic growth. Inflationary pressures have remained persistent and we are now seeing central banks taking even more aggressive steps to reduce inflation as we have seen in the Fed yesterday.  The situation is being compounded by geopolitical tensions and supply chain constraints, which has eased from pandemic peaks but remain in many industries. Despite this, unemployment rates remain low, wages are rising and consumer savings levels remain high. With this backdrop, consumer spending and particularly travel-related spending remains strong.  Looking at this from a geographic standpoint, U.S. retail spending remains healthy as consumers navigate a high inflation environment. Spending has been aided by strong job creation and the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our Mastercard spending pulse, which is based on all payment types including cash and checks, U.S. retail sales ex auto ex gas were up 6% in the second quarter versus a year ago. In Europe, spending trends are positive although the risks related to both the supply of natural gas and higher interest rates remain headwinds. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged a recovery of other regions. While COVID-related requirements have been relaxed in several countries, strong restrictions remain in others. Asia continues to have significant upside potential.  Looking more specifically at our switched volume trends. Domestic volumes continue to show strong growth with notable strength in airlines, lodging, and restaurant spend. We've seen some shift in spends for the gas and groceries from discretionary categories like home furnishings in the U.S. Cross-border continues its strong recovery as border restrictions continue to be relaxed.  Cross-border travel in quarter two has now reached 118% of 2019 levels. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to hold up well.  Notwithstanding the strength in consumer spending, we will continue to watch the environment closely including fiscal and monetary policy responses to high inflation and their potential impacts on spending. Within this environment, we will continue to be nimble in managing our expenses. We have the flexibility to respond quickly across a number of levers as we showed in 2020.  Having said this, we will continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom-line growth over the longer term. We have well-diversified business model and we are executing against our three key strategic priorities, expanding in payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And here is an update on how we are progressing against each one of those.  First, we are expanding in payments by continuing to grow card volume, driving acceptance growth and leaning into innovation to capture other prioritized payment flows. We are driving growth in card volume with new consumer, small business, co-brand and travel wins globally.  In Canada, we are excited to announce that we secured a new partnership with CIBC that creates an opportunity for material share shift of Mastercard with the Bank. We also renewed our relationship with the Royal Bank of Canada including a range of services that will enable us to grow our proprietary and co-brand volumes with them.  In the U.S., we established a new partnership agreement with the U.S. Bank, which extends our current debit, credit, co-brand and small business credit programs. It includes several new products including the first large-scale launch of a consumer credit product, a small business credit offering and the development of Buy Now Pay Later installment solutions.  We are excited to announce that we have completed the conversion of Gap Inc.'s existing 10 million card members to Mastercard across the Old Navy Gap Banana Republic and Athleta brands. We renewed and expanded our co-brand with Brooks Brothers issued by Citi and we have renewed and expanded our co-brand with Barnes and Noble in partnership with Barclays.  Outside of North America, we have secured several new wins and renewals including a number of deals that position us well in Asia Pacific as the region rebounds from the pandemic. In Australia, we've expanded our partnership with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, enabling us to maintain exclusivity with Bendigo and convert several of their regional debit portfolios.  We are pleased to announce that National Australia Bank and Mastercard has signed an agreement to retain and grow the Mastercard components of Citigroup Australia's consumer business that was acquired by NAB. This marks the first significant issuing relationship between the two companies in years and we look forward to partnering to grow these portfolios.  In Hong Kong, we partner with Citibank and HKT's loyalty program and digital ventures arm, The Club to launch the Citi The Club credit card.  In India, we are happy to report that the embargo on new issues has been lifted. Issuers have restarted card issuance and they are eager to expand business with us. An example is Yes Bank where we signed a consumer credit agreement that will enable us to maintain a majority share and includes the commitment to scale our World Elite portfolio.  We worked hard to expand our travel-oriented portfolios which positions us well to capitalize on the strong recovery of travel. For example, in Asia Pacific we entered into a ten year commercial card issuance deal with Trip.com, one of the world's largest online travel agency.  In the UAE, we renewed our co-brand portfolio with Marriott. In the U.S. we have renewed our longstanding co-brand relationship with Amtrak and we expanded our co-brand partnership with Virgin Atlantic in the UK, a partnership that will leverage our test and learn, innovation labs and SessionM loyalty assets.  We are also driving growth in payments by continuing to expand acceptance. Mastercard is now accepted at over 90 million merchant locations worldwide and we have more than doubled the number of acceptance locations over the last five years.  Mastercard has been driving tap on phone innovation enabling billions of active smartphones to become potential acceptance devices with over 130 deployments across 55 markets. This includes working with Apple to enable acceptance of Mastercard contactless cards and digital payments suited tap to pay on iPhone capability. This allows businesses to accept payments directly on their iPhones.  Mastercard is further empowering the ecosystem through our card commerce capabilities, which enables our channel partners to quickly deliver cost-effective acceptance. It also provides easy access to a range of payment solutions and services including tap on phone, QR, installments, loyalty, data insights and more via the Mastercard cloud.  In addition, we continue to drive adoption of our click to pay online guest checkout capability. Click to pay is now enabled in over 20 markets across all regions, attractions - transactions have been growing quarter-over-quarter.  We are expanding in payments through innovations like Mastercard Installments. Our open loop Buy Now Pay Later program has been very well received. Mastercard's Installment is now soon to be live with Saudi National Bank and several new partners adding their support to the program. Examples include, Cross River Bank, Evolve Bank & Trust, Jifiti, Live Oak, MOCA Financials, and Web Bank in the U.S., as well as HSBC, Natwest and JPMorgan's payments division in the UK. In addition, Apple recently announced Apple Pay Later, which uses the Mastercard Installments program.  Finally, we are driving growth in payments by leaning into innovation to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows including disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, B2B accounts payable and consumer bill pay. This is at the heart of the investments we've been making to develop a range of capabilities that span cards, account-to-account payments, push payments and blockchain.  We're at various stages of scaling our capabilities across these different flows and we are making steady progress. For example, we are expanding network reach through new cross-border services relationships with partners like Doha Bank and Vodafone in Qatar and UPT, a leading money transfer operator in Turkey. We are targeting specific use cases and scaling distribution through B2B partnerships with Mastercard Send. A few examples, Caesars Sportsbook will leverage Send for instant payment of online winnings and Paysafe will integrate Mastercard Send into their payments platform to enhance the payout capabilities offered to their merchant customers in the UK and the EU.  Now turning to services, our services capabilities have proven to be a tremendous growth driver and differentiator for our business, build on a foundation of investments and experiences built over the years. Looking forward, we continue to see a significant opportunity for services in three primary areas. First, services will continue to enhance the value of payments.  Services make payment intelligent, safe and secure. For example, our identity check payment authentication service is driving double-digit improvements in the approval rates. We are working with PostePay in Italy to support the deployment of their issuing portfolio, assist in growing their acquiring business and enhance the customer engagement approach.  And our consulting team in Europe is engaging with ING to help them create a seamless payment experience for their clients.  Second, we see the needs of our customers expanding beyond payments. We can leverage our full suite of differentiated services to address these needs. A recent example is Travelodge, was utilizing our Test & Learn capabilities to support optimization of new investments in their business.  And third, our services can be deployed to support new networks making our open banking and digital identity propositions even stronger. With these adjacent networks it is our services that will enable us to establish a differentiated position to scale and win. For example, we recently launched a new biometric checkout program. The program outlines a set of standards from banks, merchants and tech providers helping to ensure the security and privacy of personal data when people pay with a smile or with a wave.  Beyond expanding in payments and expanding in services our third key strategic priority area is embracing new networks. As a reminder, our current focus is on two areas, open banking and digital identity. We are leveraging our Finicity and IR acquisitions to expand our open banking footprint, grow our customer base and deliver new solutions. This quarter we expanded our engaged partner network to include our open banking services with new fin-tech partnerships, including Dwolla, Synctera, i2c and others.  They can now use our open banking capabilities to easily build and implement solutions for their end-customers across a range of use cases. From lending to payments, to financial management. In addition, we recently launched the global Start Path open banking program. This program enables us to co-innovate with start-up fintechs like Dapi, Finantier, mmob, Mono, and Paywallet as we support their path to scale.  We have expanded our open banking product offering as well. We announced pay by link in Europe to allows business to send payment request through invoice, email, SMS, or social media chat. This can expedite the payment of invoices in a cost-efficient way and aiding both parties to better manage cash flows.  Online accounting provider Visma Dinero is using pay by link to simplify invoice payments for over 75,000 small and medium-sized businesses.  And in the digital identity space, Ekata continues its strong performance signing over 200 new deals and expansion since we acquired the company just over one year ago. This includes many of the leading Buy Now Pay Later and crypto companies. It also includes real-time payment software providers like ECI Worldwide who is leveraging encompassed capabilities to help their global merchant network more accurately to identify fraudulent transactions.  Both in banking and digital identity are attractive and growing opportunities and Mastercard is uniquely positioned to be successful in both.  So in summary, our business fundamentals remain strong. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again. We are executing against our strategic priorities in payments, services and new networks. We have fortified our strong position with travel-oriented portfolios to capitalize on the continued recovery in travel.  On the macroeconomic fronts, we continue to monitor on a number of factors influencing economic and spending growth. And with all of that, we will continue to manage our expenses carefully. That said, we will also continue to invest in the business to drive top and bottom-line growth over the longer term.  Sachin, over to you. Harshita, let me start off with that. This is \u2013 so we read the same article. Clearly, it's early stages because we haven't seen the bill yet. So we are all speculating here, I think what might happen. So we'll engage. We'll try to find out more over the weeks and months to come. But if you just assume for a moment that the article would be complete, and this would actually happen a few things come to mind that are straightforward from our perspective.  First of all, we believe in competition, we believe in a level of competitive landscape and playing field and we've invested massive amounts in safety and security and we focus on providing consumer choice, different ways of pay, credit, debit, whatever it is. So that's been our strategy. So we are going to look at this proposal \u2013 proposed bill through that end.  So that's one \u2013 that's a starting point for us. Some of the questions that you touched on, some points here. What are practicalities, what are the technical aspects of this, how many providers are ready that have made the same kind of investments to really ensure that the consumer can rely on safety and protection and so forth. Those are open questions. We'll have to see what the regulation actually foresees.  Overall, the concept of interchange is a balancing factor and the ecosystem is one that has served the ecosystem including the consumers well in terms of rich propositions and all of that and we'll have to see what \u2013 becomes out of that. Those are a whole range of questions that we've talked about over years that need to be considered by all stakeholders. And we will spend the time and the effort to ensure that everybody is well informed about the puts and takes around this proposed bill. I'd like to just add to that, I find travel is such a fascinating topic and certainly very central to our business. There has been a [Indiscernible] of pent-up demand like this is going to be a bubble and then it's all going to go back to where it was during the last two years. Why would anybody that has now has the chance to see their family and their friends again stop doing that in a year from now.  So I think that actually doesn't make any sense. So we believe exactly the point that Sachin just made, if there is a possibility people will continue to travel the way they have been before COVID. One other thing to add is, one thing is the underlying trend that we have built in our outlook on the data points that Sachin just talked about, but it's also to strengthen our position vis-a-vis that travel trend.  All the portfolios, we talked to you about American Airlines, about JetBlue, about Cathay Pacific, everything that we have won in the last two years is going to really come to bear to really make the most of this. Right, Rayna. I think the last word, as you said, is instructive as we are not seeing it right now, generally resilient consumer spending for the time being and we talked about the modest improvement in cross-border and same - spending behaviors until the end of last year. Now you're taking us really a long time back in 2008 and 2009.  I think the first thing I would say is it's a very different scenario. A scenario that we're looking at externally, that I come to the company in a moment, externally is we are not having a crisis around unemployment. We're having high consumer spending levels. So we don't have an asset bubble that looks anything similar than what we've seen at that time.  So a different starting point. I would say it's a somewhat more benign starting point than we had at that time. Now the company also looks entirely different than it looked in 2008 and 2009. It's a much more diversified business. It's a highly diversified business. I think we were largely consumer credit debit oriented at the time.  We have a whole range of card-based spending from push payments into general payments for goods and services, opening up new verticals and so forth and then there is our progress into new flows. So that gives us resilience on underlying payments. It also \u2013 our reach of our business model and how many payment transactions we touch that allow us to build a set of service on it looks entirely different.  Our switching ratios at that time were much, much lower than they are today, which has led to a very successful services business, which we have seen in the last two years is actually quite resilient when you go into \u2013 through up and down cycles. And as we continue to build into the future to see whenever we might face a down cycle, are we more resilient with other activities around digital identity and open banking and so forth that go into a world of open banking and move even further before or after the payment transaction to give us more resilience.  So, better earnings quality, higher diversification and we've been tested. We've been tested over the last two years. I mean there was a down cycle and we needed to demonstrate agility and the speed and managing our expenses, make the right investment decisions. So we feel we're well positioned to navigate what's going to \u2013 whatever is going to come. Hopefully, it's positive. Could you repeat your first question? Alright. Good. So, what we're seeing here is, first of all, on the backdrop, let's just pick up on the structural changes, again, that we have seen over the last two years. Clearly driven by social distancing measures are up a significant push into more digital engagement by consumers. They were sitting at home, so all that. It's a more digital world.  So here, services that helped make a more digital world safer and more easily understood. That's really the general thrust of what's driving the growth and the interest from our customers across established customer sets, as well as new ones earlier, I talked about travel watches. People come to us and say, hey, I want to use all of that data to get a better understanding of my business. So, taking it one-by-one, safety security, anything in the fraud space and in the authentication space has been a joy for us. You go further into cyber risk assessments. Our small business is safe.  Those many small businesses that have opened up in a more digital fashion now over the last two years and you go all the way into digital identity because in a more digital world, people find to have more passwords and nobody wants \u2013 really wants that. So digital identity is now a solution that's really taking hold. So that's that whole space.  And you saw us \u2013 actually doesn't stop at current types of payments. So the last thing I should add is our acquisition of CipherTrace and how we are going into the crypto space, making that safer as that is certainly something that captures consumers' interests, one space.  The second piece is what do you do with all of that data, retail and commerce, travel logic, I give you one example, many other customers are trying to understand how to make \u2013 run their business better using the payments data that is thrown off and we helped them with that. Our Dynamic Yield acquisition is one of them, where we help customers, retail and commerce customers engage their customers, their end customers in a more targeted fashion.  I imagine a landing page that now has personalized offers. In our case, always with strong consent from consumers and a focus on data privacy. So those are the two headlines. We do various other things and services from consulting into processing-related activities and so forth, but that's centered across. Thank you, Lisa. So let me start off on that. Where the consumer protection agency here in the U.S. and some other markets are going is really to ensure that there is the right kind of protections for consumers that goes all the way from responsible lending to safety, security and so forth.  We follow that. But if I look just in-house and see what we are doing, if I look at our data principles, what we have done around the Mastercard Installments program to ensure that the participating lenders go through a vetting process and follow responsible lending rules that we have set as part of our franchise, we feel well positioned.  I feel we are a good industry custodian to ensure that these responsible practices are being held around. Now is that also an opportunity for us in all of this? Absolutely. We have learned to partner with P2P systems in many countries around the world with safety and security solutions. The services I actually just talked about when we say, hey, you have a fraud issue, we get it.  Here's a set of answers that we have for you to partner and in other markets, we compete head-on because we simply believe we have the better solution and players not necessarily always want to partner with us. So it's a bit of a mix, give and take, but it's an interesting and dynamic field that we are very focused on. Tien-Tsin, let me start off with the deal activity. The momentum that we have seen over the last two years throughout the pandemic, where we lean with our customers and say, hey, what do you need and these are tough times? I think we set ourselves up as a trusted partner and help to shape that deal pipeline that we currently see, which is very strong.  Deal pipeline is strong across all regions and we gave you a few examples today from \u2013 we haven't talked much about Canada lately. So these are strong wins. This is excellent. Some of the very significant wins we talked about over a year ago in Europe when you think about NatWest, Deutsche Bank, the multi-regional deal that we have with Santander, they are progressing according to plan.  The conversions are going on. I mentioned very specifically back to United States. The GAP conversion is actually done on those 10 million cards. So overall, we talked to you at the Investor Day in November last year that we see share growth across all of our carded products and we continue to feel very good about that.  So momentum, it's competitive out there, of course. But I think the mix of what we have in various payment solutions, as well as services sets us apart. We've also relooked at how we deploy our sales resources across the company with all the acquisitions that we have so that we can do the best possible work for our customers. So overall, strong momentum that I think will continue. Alright, let me start, and then Sachin can chime in. So David, as a matter of fact is Europe is not homogenous. That's the first thing I would say. When you look at where we are on the arc of the secular shift, it's very different. So there is lots of opportunity across the board from further digitization. The opportunity to go beyond P2M and sets of flows is wide open in Europe.  The push of the European authorities to digitize beyond just in-store payments and online payments is significantly there. We are well-positioned with our tools in Europe, which is pushing on open banking, which is pushing on open on account-to-account, which is pushing bill pay solutions. So we have all of that in a hop. So we feel that there is significant opportunity. And as I said before, there is uncertainty on the European macroeconomic front. But on the other hand, macroeconomic GDP overall economy and our baskets are two different things, and we'll have to kind of see how that will play out. I can't really predict that. I am from there, so I have a sense, but I am not in the business of predictions. Right. So open banking, let me start off more generally speaking. So clearly, a global trend, one that's to stay. It's happening in Brazil. It's happening in Australia, certainly was there in the United States and Europe. The way we approach it is, first of all, we have a relevant position in connectivity and then building out a bunch of use cases.  And the use cases that would get really to the heart of your question, you see very different types of kind of revenue models, value exchange models. First of all, on connectivity itself, you have per API call kind of logic. If you go into financial management solutions and it depends on who's our customer here, let's say it's a fintech that could again be by API.  But you could start to see as we go into lending, mortgage verification, asset verification, kind of use cases. Those are kind of \u2013 that's the broad range of currently what we're seeing no established model at this point in time. I mean, we are investing heavily Aiia, Finicity because we feel there is a tremendous opportunity.  This is \u2013 it's going to help to pull so many new customers into \u2013 consumers into the ecosystem, on the financial inclusion side, on the SME side and so forth. So, hard to answer very specifically right now where we are, but those are those kind of different kind of models and it's going to be multi-geography and it's going to be here around to stay. Alright. Thank you. So much for that last question, exciting space. We are going to close the call now. We are at the top of the hour. Appreciate your time this morning. Do want to thank our 24,000 colleagues around the world and I want to thank all of you who have joined us today for your continued support for Mastercard. Talk to you in a quarter. Thank you so much."

Good morning, everyone. Russia's invasion of Ukraine marked a somber start to 2022, as war returned to Europe for the first time in decades. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we decided to suspend our business operations in Russia. We did not take this decision lightly, given that Mastercard has operated in Russia for more than 25 years. We are now focused on the orderly suspension of business operations in Russia and supporting the well-being of our employees and their families across the whole region. Even in the context of this challenging geopolitical environment, we're off to a strong start in 2022. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably in cross-border travel. Quarter one adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis. On the macroeconomic front, consumer spending remains strong, particularly as economies across the globe continue to reopen and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Labor markets are firm, with low unemployment rates and rising wages. Weighing against this healthy backdrop are a number of factors that they are monitoring, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints geopolitical uncertainties and COVID with infection rates. We're monitoring these developments including the fiscal, monitory, public health care and other policy responses. Let's look at this from a geographic standpoint. US retail spending remains healthy, aided in part by the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our quarter one spending pulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, US retail sales ex-auto, ex-gas were up 4.7% versus a year ago. In Europe, spending trends are positive, although the invasion of Ukraine has introduced risks to economic growth looking ahead. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate, following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged the recovery of other regions. We're seeing several countries relaxing COVID-related restrictions, like others are facing stronger measures. Asia continues to have significant upside potential. Looking at Mastercard spending trends, we continue to see strong growth. Domestic switched volumes or strength across a broad range of sectors including retail, utilities and professional spend. We also saw strong growth in travel and entertainment including spending with airlines, travel agencies, lodging and restaurants. In terms of cross-border where the growth was particularly strong the recovery continued this quarter led by travel. Cross-border travel reached 2019 levels as of March for the first time since the pandemic began. Geographically, the cross-border recovery has been broad-based with improvement across all regions. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to be strong. Our strategy is designed to enable and capitalize on these trends and executing against our three key strategic priorities: one expanding in payments, two extending our services and three embracing new networks. Here is an update on how we're progressing against each of those. First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to grow card payments and leaning into innovation and new payment technologies to catch-up other prioritized payment flows. We're driving growth in comp payments through new consumer, small business, co-brand and fintech wins. On the consumer and small business front, I'm excited to announce an enhanced partnership with Wells Fargo which includes several new elements. Wells Fargo will now issue Mastercard small business credit cards and for the first time in almost a decade, consumer proprietary and co-brand credit products. We're also excited to announce that we have deepened our relationship with our long-standing partner, Capital One. In addition to renewing our existing business, we will also be their issuing network for a larger number of new originations across both their consumer and small business products. Further on the small business front, we are expanding our small business portfolio with the First National Bank of Omaha, also partnering with the bank and Verizon to launch a new Verizon business Mastercard targeting Verizon's small business customers. In total, these partnerships will help us continue growing our U.S. small business market share. Outside the U.S. we're driving commercial card growth through new partnerships with leading B2B tech companies like Clara. We will be flipping Clara's business portfolio in Mexico to MasterCard and are working for them to launch new programs in five additional markets across Latin America. Turning to co-brands, we've made substantial progress to ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel. We have renewed and expanded our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, one of the largest co-brand programs in the United States. American will continue to leverage our capabilities including SessionM and will participate in our Staff cast program to identify in tech partners who can help drive innovation across the airline. And in the U.K. we have launched two new Barclaycard Avios cards with Barclays and International Airlines Group loyalty. Outside of travel we've expanded our relationships with leading retailers including a new co-brand program with Victoria's Secret and a renewal of our Ulta Beauty co-brand offering both in partnership with Red Financial. We're also continuing to advance our leadership in the digital and fintech space, through new product launches and new partnerships. We're partnering with BCA Digital, the digital banking arm of the largest private bank in Indonesia to launch a digital-first Mastercard debit product catering to millennials. And in Latin America we signed a regional partnership with global payment processing platform Galileo. The partnership establishes Mastercard as Galileo preferred partner across several markets in Latin America and they will work to integrate and distribute several of our products and services to help their fintech customers. In addition to driving new wins, we are leveraging our services capabilities to execute against many of the large portfolio migrations that are in flight. In Europe, our consulting teams are engaging with our partners at Santander, NatWest and Deutsche Bank to ensure a smooth and timely transition and to identify opportunities to optimize those portfolios. Santander is the bulk of the way through a nine million card migration and we expected to be complete by early next year, while NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard at the end of last year and plans to migrate their entire 16 million card portfolio by the middle of 2023. Deutsche Bank's $10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued as Mastercard-branded cards with a credit migration starting in quarter four of this year and the debit migration commencing early next year. Similarly our team in the US is supporting key migrations including Gap Inc., Merrick Bank, and First Interstate Bank. All the migrations are on track with Gap Inc. scheduled to be completed this summer. We're also expanding in payments by leading entertainment innovation in areas like installments and cryptocurrencies. Here are a few examples. Our Openbit [ph] Mastercard installment program has been very well received and is progressing according to plan. Remember Mastercard installment is built into our network making by Buy Now Pay Later available to millions of consumers and merchants worldwide. We continue to add a wide array of new lender and fintech partners including Amount, Deserve, i2c, Lithic and Southern Bank. In this quarter, we announced several merchant partners who are excited to support MasterCard installments including Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, H&R Block, Saks Fifth Avenue and Walgreens. US customers will begin offering MasterCard installments to consumers this quarter and international expansion is planned for later this year. And we continue to build solutions to support the crypto economy with a principled approach focused on three key areas. First, helping consumers easily and safely purchase cryptocurrencies and NFTs. In addition we are enabling consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and catching up their crypto wallets via MasterCard Send. Second, providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants, including engaging with central banks as they design and develop central bank digital currencies. Third, preparing our core network to directly support digital currencies. Making substantial progress in each of these areas. This quarter the Gemini Mastercard, which offers crypto rewards went live across the US. We also partner with Nexo to launch a new crypto card in Europe, one that uses consumers' digital assets as collateral to back their credit line. And we established several other international cryptocard partnerships including banks in Europe and Abra, Invesco and Bello in Latin America. On the crypto services front, MercadoLibre will be leveraging psychotraces AI and cyber capabilities to bring security and trust to their digital wallet in Brazil. Now turning to our second strategic priority services, as I've noted before, our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role enabling many of the wins I mentioned. We also continue to extend our services across multiple growth vectors through new payment platform capabilities, new verticals and new use cases. Here are a few examples. First, earlier this month we completed our acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Now that the transaction is closed, we will combine Dynamic Yield personalization platform and decision engine within our SessionM loyalty platform and our test-and-learn experimentation software. The result will be a truly differentiated consumer engagement and loyalty hub for our customers. Second, we announced that we're expanding our consulting services into three new practices dedicated to open banking and open data, crypto and digital currencies and ESG. We've seen increased customer demand and a growing portfolio of successful engagements in these areas. For example, we are supporting Handelsbanken and Intesa Sanpaolo design programs that advance their ESG priorities. We're helping Wirex explore innovations in crypto. And finally, we're expanding the breadth of our customer base and deploying our capabilities to solve for a wider range of use cases. For example, we deployed our Test & Learn capabilities to help tailored brands, optimize retail operations and improve marketing efficiency for the leading menswear brands. And deployed our FX capabilities with Santander in Spain to help streamline dispute resolutions and prove the customer experience. Beyond expanding in payments and extending and services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks. Our current focus is on two areas: open banking and digital identity. Our open banking and multi-rail strategies are converging enabling us to leverage our unique set of assets to address new flows in verticals, like rent payments. For rent payments, the risk of ACH returns due to insufficient funds is a significant pain point in both renters and landlords. To address this challenge, we're launching a new suite of smart payment decisioning tools. These solutions use Finicity's open banking capabilities to recommend the optimal payment day and payment rail for each transaction based on cost, speed and risk. The Bill Payment Alliance, a collection of more than two million rental homes will be one of the first fintech partners to launch these capabilities. We plan to expand these solutions across a broad range of bill payment verticals. In addition, we continue to expand our open banking reach with Finicity and Aiia, by penetrating new verticals and establishing new partnerships. We continue to enhance our capabilities at the mortgage vertical and are now expanding into the auto lending vertical. We're leading the way in terms of provisioning permission-based income, employment and asset verification information and we've partnered with Stripe, who will be using our open banking capabilities for a variety of use cases. We're also extending our open banking reach through data access agreements with products like Fiserv, which will enable direct API connectivity to thousands of FIs in the United States. In the digital identity space, Ekata continued its strong performance in quarter one, securing deals with financial services companies including MoneyLine and several leading Buy Now Pay Later providers. In addition, we recently joined forces with Microsoft and a collaboration to improve digital transaction approval rates and reduce fraud. The solution enables issuers to optimize authorization decisions using network and merchant-specific authentication data. Combined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction and into new digital transactions. These are attractive and growing opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to be successful in both. In summary, our business fundamentals remain strong and we delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again this quarter, which also reflects our disciplined approach to expense management. We're executing against our strategic priorities notably expanding our share with key issuers. In addition, we've worked hard to expand our travel-oriented portfolios which positions us well to capitalize on a strong recovery in cross-border travel. And last but not least, we want to reflect on what is most important, the safety and well being of our employees and their families who have been impacted by the war. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Ukraine. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 27% reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed two ppt to this group. These revenues were above expectation primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border and domestic volumes favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues. Operating expenses increased 13% including a six ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40% which includes a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 61%, which includes a 20 ppt benefit due to the recognition of a one-time discrete tax benefit related to a US tax regulation published in the current period and a one ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was up 65% year-over-year to $2.76, which includes a $0.36 contribution from the one-time discrete tax benefit and a $0.05 from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $599 million through April 25th, 2022. So, let's turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Of note, data related to sanctioned Russian banks was not reported to us and hence such amounts are not included in Q1 2022. In the US, GDV increased by 14% with credit growth of 31% and debit growth of 1%, reflecting the recovery of credit spending on travel and the lapping of stimulus. Outside of the US, volume increased 19% with credit growth of 20% and debit growth of 18%. Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 50% and other third quarter volumes up 56%, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, cross-border volume was above 2019 levels for all regions and cross-border travel was above 2019 levels for the first time in March. Turning now to page five. Switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q1 and were at 150% of 2019 levels. Card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. With respect to card counts, as a result of the suspension of our business operations in Russia, cards issued by Russian banks are no longer active on our network and are therefore excluded from our card counts this quarter. So, accordingly card growth was lower at 4% this quarter. If you exclude Russian issued cards from current and prior years, our growth would have been 9%. Globally, the 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's look to page six with our highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately two ppt to this growth. I also like to point out that in the first quarter the suspension of business operations in Russia had a minimal impact to the overall growth rate of the company as the loss of volume was offset by a onetime benefit of lower rebates and incentives due to the absence of a customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21% while worldwide GDV grew 17%. The four ppt difference is primarily due to unreported volumes from Russian-related sanction customers and a favorable mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57%, while cross-border volumes increased 53% both ahead of expectations. The full ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex-intra Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 27% while switched transactions grew 22%. The five ppt difference is primarily due to favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues. Other revenues were up 20% including a seven ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 30% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. As a percentage of gross revenues rebates and incentives were lower than expected primarily due to the absence of a planned customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia, a higher mix of cross-border revenues and the timing of new internode deals. Moving to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 13% including a six ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions operating expenses grew 7% primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs. Turning to page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of April. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, we have included an appendix later in the deck to show all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods. Going through the metrics in turn. Starting with switch volumes. For the first three weeks of April, we grew 23% year-over-year down four ppt versus Q1 primarily due to the cessation of activities in Russia. If you exclude Russia-related volumes from the current and prior periods switch volumes grew 27% down one ppt versus Q1. Switch transactions grew 14% year-over-year through the first three weeks of April down eight ppt from Q1 again driven primarily by the absence of Russia-related transactions. Of note Russia has a relatively low average ticket size which results in a larger relative impact to this metric. If you exclude Russia-related transactions from the current and prior periods switched transactions grew by 25% year-over-year up one ppt versus Q1. Overall cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of April grew 60% year-over-year up seven ppt versus Q1. Excluding Russia from the current and prior periods cross-border volumes through the same period grew 65% year-over-year up 13 pp versus Q1.  Since the end of January cross-border travel has rebounded quickly as border restrictions continue to be lifted and we distance ourselves from Omicron. In the first three weeks of April, cross-border travel was up 179% year-over-year up 38 ppt versus Q1. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel was up 5% year-over-year in April, a decrease of 8 ppt compared to Q1, reflecting in part the lapping of a strong comparable period a year ago. One point to emphasize is cross-border travel is now above pre-pandemic levels at 110% of 2019 levels. Turning to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong, as we continue to grow our customer relationships and expand our product and service offerings. As Michael mentioned, consumer spending remains robust, particularly as economies open further and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Having said this, we are monitoring a number of factors, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and COVID infection rates. At this stage, we have not seen any significant impact of these and consumer spending. Cross-border travel is recovering rapidly as border restrictions ease. This is occurring faster than our earlier expectations. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios. Weighing against these positive trends are the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the suspension of our business operations in Russia. So now taking all of this into account, we continue to expect net revenues for full year 2022 to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. So, essentially, we are maintaining our growth expectations in the same range as the strong cross-border travel recovery and strength in consumer spending helped mitigate the loss of sizable revenues in Russia and Ukraine. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of three to four ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro. In terms of operating expenses, we are reducing our forecast for the year to reflect cost savings related to Russia. All year, we expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about four to five ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately two to three ppt for the year. With respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects closely strong consumer spending, including continued improvement in cross-border travel spending relative to 2019. Secondly the discontinuation of revenues from Russia and a sequential reduction in revenues related to Ukraine. And finally, the lapping of a strong year good quarter that was aided by fiscal stimulus and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, as vaccination programs rolled out. Acquisitions are forecast to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately five to six ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about four to five ppt to this growth, including the acquisition of Dynamic Yield, which we are pleased to have just closed. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately three to four ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year based on the current geographic mix of our business. Before closing out, I want to briefly comment on our three year performance objectives for 2022 to 2024. Clearly, the elimination of Russia-related revenues and the reduction of those from Ukraine create a headwind to achieving these objectives. If this would continue, it would result in a headwind of approximately two ppt to our net revenue CAGR. Having said this, we are off to a strong start in 2022 with the recovery of cross-border travel ahead of expectations, as I previously mentioned. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth for the company. And net-net, it is really too early to adjust our three year performance objectives, as we work to offset some or all of these headwinds. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. \nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Sachin. Jamaria [ph] we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I've had a question on inflation. I know the data suggests the consumer remains in good shape as we look across trends in the vertical as such. Are you seeing anything that sort of is seeing some kind of negative impact on consumer spending patterns as a result of inflation? I know we heard some comments on e-commerce. Maybe you could talk about that? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach : Sanjay, thanks for your question. So on the inflation side, as Sachin mentioned earlier, we have not seen anything yet in terms of changing consumer spending behaviors. But what we are seeing is in terms of the impact on vertical mix and so forth. There has been a 1% increase in our switched volume that's related to gas price increases. We're seeing some shifts in the airline. That is again under an inflationary pressure there from ticket pricing perspective. So we have to see where it goes going forward. I mean fundamentally, where I stand on this is the push by consumers into the digital space. They learn these habits they're online. All that will continue. And we'll see where the underlying prices go and then comes back to what we've been saying all along. There's macro considerations in each country that has to be considered here. What is monetary fiscal policy and then there is the micro aspects of the different verticals which ones of those are carded which ones we would see which ones we wouldn't see. Could there be a crowding out effect of rents or gas prices particularly in Europe? Yes that might be but that's not something we can tell yet.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good morning. Michael, Sachin, I want to ask about cross-border travel very strong recovery here. Is there a scenario where, even if let's say China and other parts of Asia don't come back meaningfully, you can still kind of get back to this like normalized 30% to 40% kind of levels above 2019 which is depend with the run rate pre-pandemic? Because there's so much pent-up demand, or does Asia and China need to come back for the next like cross-border recovery? And Sachin, just a follow-up for you. Can you just talk about the sensitivity of your revenue guidance should macro consumer spend deteriorate from here? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Harshita. So first on your question on cross-border, you're absolutely right. Cross-border travel has actually come back stronger than our expectations and there continues to be pent-up demand. And we in terms of how we're thinking about our guidance, we've kind of built in that improving recovery in cross-border travel on a going-forward basis as well. So I just want to kind of get that out there. But to give you a little bit more color right on cross-border. So cross-border volumes are above 2019 levels across all regions for the first time. I would tell you that, the top 20 destinations which represented approximately 70% of our total cross-border travel pre-pandemic, and we're at 70% of 2019 levels when we discussed this at our Investor Community Meeting, are now at 85% in Q1 of 2022. Specifically, on your question around Asia-Pacific, I think it's important to note that Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. The Asia Pacific opportunity as I see this is as follows: Asia Pacific represented approximately 14% of total inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic and we're at 40% of our 2019 levels in Q1. So as you can see from this number right that, there is a fair amount of recovery still remaining to come from Asia Pacific. Obviously, it does matter in terms of how restrictions are lifted in that market. Again, the point is at the end of the day cross-border fundamentally is still very sound. This is something we've been talking about right through the pandemic, where we felt like when restrictions are eased volumes in cross-border will come back. We've seen that happen and we continue to believe fundamentally that that remains very much in place on EP in particular, a couple of thoughts in China. One the \u2013 both China both from an inbound and an outbound standpoint where not a very significant portion of our cross-border volumes pre-pandemic. In fact, I would argue that, the outbound China was slightly higher than the inbound China. So when you think about recovery you've also got to think about what restrictions are there in terms of people going into countries versus people coming out of countries. And I would tell you outbound China has shown better improvement than inbound China for obvious reasons as we all know that, there have been locked out in China and things of that sort. So net-net as I said back and I think about this I think about the fundamentals of cross-border being strong. I think about the potential for pent-up demand continue to contribute to improvements in cross-border travel spend. And again, the Asia Pacific region still remains a fairly large opportunity on a going forward basis.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. If I can just build on that, we love cross-border. But while we love the trends, it's a lot of hard work. And over the last two years, I mean, the travel industry was hard hit from the outset of the pandemic. We have leaned in. And as I recall over the last two years JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, LatAm, Aeroplan, AirCanada you name it it's a long list of where we have either expanded renewed one additional volume. So we're participating in the trend in a very significant way. And we've always said, it's going to happen this year and we're ready for that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please proceed with your question,\nRayna Kumar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It was really good to see the strong operating margin expansion in the quarter 460 basis points. Can you discuss some of the underlying drivers outside of the return of cross-border and how sustainable you believe in upper 50% operating margin is going forward?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Rayna, happy to take that question. So look I mean at the end of the day, you know that, the business as we have it is a high operating leverage business, right? At the end of the day incremental dollars of revenue typically flow to the bottom line just given the nature of how we operate. So certainly cross-border recovery is playing into the recovery in operating margins but it's not just about cross-border. It's about overall strong consumer spending and cross-border travel recovery all of, which is contributing to the delivery of improved operating margins. Helping that even further is the good new strength in our services and everything we're doing along those parts. So it's everything which we are doing in terms of driving the fundamentals of our business back to the strategic priorities Michael was talking about, which is growing our payments keeping on leaning in on services and then continue to invest in the new network space which is really important. So all of those factors are contributing factors to the expanding operating margins that you're seeing come through. The message I'd like to leave you with on this is the following: We continue to run the business for long-term sustainable growth, which means effectively that we're going to continue to invest in a disciplined manner to ensure that we are creating the right opportunities for ourselves to deliver this long-term top line growth. And while we do that you should see the impact of that come through in terms of operating margins.\nA \u2013 Warren Kneeshaw: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question\nDarrin Peller: Hi. Thanks, guys. When we look at the types of opportunities on cross-border that you're seeing right now you clearly are positioned as you said before to take advantage of the upswing in travel. And historically it's been very high pass-through without rebates incentives, I think as I have a correlation. So first of all, just to be clear, I mean should we still expect that to be the case, or is there anything around the new business the relationships that Michael you mentioned earlier, that would cause that growth yield, I guess we can say our net yield to be a little bit different going forward on this type of big pickup in resumption and spending on travel.  And then Michael just more strategically, when we think about that that industry in terms of cross-border payments. There's been so much change. And even you guys are trying to work through opportunities for more A to A [ph] and open banking opportunities across globally. And so does that change the ecosystem at all, or is card-based really, how you expect to see cross-border players stay really dominant for payments cross-border over time? \nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Aaron. I'll take the first part and then Michael will address your second question. I guess the headline is the following which is, we're not seeing anything fundamentally changed in terms of the profile of our cross-border revenues. I mean net-net things are going to move around depending on how much cross-border comes from intra-Europe versus volumes from outside of that intra-Europe corridor because as you know intra-Europe is lower yielding and then other cross-border volumes are higher yielding. But fundamentally, I would tell you not much has changed. I will make one point. You talked about rebates and incentives not being there with cross-border. I would say that there's a lower indexation of rebates and incentives to cross-border. There's always been some level of rebates incentives, which have been associated with cross-border not nearly as high as what's there in the domestic volume environment. But we're not seeing fundamentally much change in that regard. \nMichael Miebach: Right. And strategically, so Darrin here's what I'd say is similar lens that we took at Investor Day where we looked at different universes and different use cases. You got the P2M world where card is well established domestically but also certainly cross-border. The industry and we very specifically with our services propositions have found a way to ensure that the risks associated with these cross-border transactions for merchants and for consumers are addressed. So the conversion rates and the approval rates have continuously increased. And there's a lot of value brought. So there isn't much of a problem to be resolved to payment for payments for goods on a cross-border basis.  Now where we're actively looking in our -- it tends to participate in all relevant payment flows. We're saying what other payment volumes happening cross-border that we can contribute to with our technology through our franchise and so forth. And here the whole space of import-export, cross-border and accounts payable. That's a space where a counter-account solutions make sense for us to hold.  We have specifically called out for you at the Investor Day the focus on remittances. Again, that's a significant opportunity for us. That's all additive and expensive from a target market perspective from an opportunity perspective. Attractive growing opportunities. We have the technology on the cross-border remittances side our Transfast acquisition, our buyout on the HomeSend side all of that is coming together. It's a 100 country reach.  So I think what we're bringing here is the multilateral network idea into this space that has been historically inefficient. So, I look at it as a growth opportunity while we're going to continue to power the cost side of the house. \nWarren Kneeshaw: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. \nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. I was hoping to shine a spotlight on LatAm, specifically Brazil. Just taking a peak of the supplementals Mastercard's volumes are up 40% to 50% in that region. But Brazil is also a market where you've got a local network like PIX, gaining a lot of traction. Can you just use as an example to talk a bit about how Mastercard coexist in a market like that, with one of these domestic networks and is a player like PIX actually a customer or a potential customer of some of your open banking or fraud or identity services? Thank you. \nMichael Miebach: All right. So let me take that. So first of all, Brazil has been a market in focused strategically important market for us for years. We're very well established on with the large banks out there Itau and others to mention. So, I'm actually seeing the Brazilian country manager right after this call. So, it's very much in focus. We're very happy with what's going on there. Overall, it's a market that drives a lot of innovation.  Buy Now, Pay Later has been a thing in Brazil forever. Open banking is on the rise, real-time payments is on the rise. So, a lot of movement there. And the P2P network that's been introduced by the Central Bank in the Brazil market is another push to further digitization in that market. So, the whole digitization in Brazil is really seeing great momentum and we're leaning right into that.  Now the kind of flow that PIX is going after, you see a lot of P2P flows and some B2B flows, so that's not necessarily anything that we're particularly worried about but it's also the kind of flows as part of our multi-rail strategy that we like to support ourselves and we have a whole set of technologies for that. What's have paid just to point one out which is the first live in Brazil itself is set a market with innovation and a lot of momentum there.  So, here's our technology powering a social network as an alternative which is an easy user experience great adoption 4.7 million users already on that platform. So, I look at it as a market that's a lot to learn from, a market that we invest in and where we chart passed for the new additional flows beyond card flows very with specific local solutions considering the size of the market. \nSachin Mehra: And I'll just add Michael a couple of thoughts on Brazil. One you asked the question about the strong growth. Clearly, it's a combination of the macro environment, but it's also the fact that we've been leaning in pretty heavily with our traditional issuers as well as our fintech partners in that space which has been part of the reason why we've been seeing some of that growth come through in a decent manner, Lisa. The second point I'd make tying back to Michael's comments around PICCs [ph], the market has to be bifurcated in the context of both debit and credit. And on the credit side, we continue to see tremendous growth. PICCs -- which Michael said is primarily catering to P2P and B2B flows, even if it were to actually proliferate a little bit into call it the smaller merchants from a P2M standpoint were primarily be focused around the debit side of the equation and so credit still remains the mainstay for us in Brazil as it stands.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to check in on the call it balance of trade and this whole card volume coming in and out from wins and losses migrating. Given the update, I know you mentioned Wells -- and of course ended there not West in Deutsche Bank, are you gaining share when all is said and done? I'm just trying to get a better sense especially in the short term with all the migrations in and out where you stand in the share gains. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So everything we kind of talked about and Michael talked about earlier on in this conversation was about our expanding relationships with these issuers. And so with these issuers, we are gaining share. That's kind of the reality of the situation. Again, there are puts and takes in the market, right? So as I think about the new relationship well I should say new relationship, the expanded relationship we have with Wells, right, that's an increasing share position with Wells which is taking place for example there. So the bottom line is the following which is whether it's Wells, Capital One, what we're doing with Santander and NatWest, Deutsche -- you name it the GAAP portfolio all of these incrementally are helping us drive our volumes. From a holistic market standpoint, again, like I said, there are puts and takes, right? But we're very, very optimistic about how we are seeing business translate for us. And as we mentioned at the Investor Community Day, we are growing market share across all regions and the market share growth which we've seen in 16 of our top 20 markets which is something we shared with you at the Investor Community Day is really the data points we put out so far.\nMichael Miebach: And Tien-Tsin, I should add, I'm very happy to ask the question. I thought these news was just going to pass by with none of you asking about it, so it's much appreciated.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, very much. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel growth was solid in Q1, but did slow throughout the quarter and into April against known very difficult comparisons. Can you unpack cross-border card-not-present ex travel growth by geography, especially in Europe and US and how you see this playing out throughout this year, especially with the return of the consumer, the physical point of sale as vaccination rates go up? In other words, do you see a reacceleration of e-com later this year, or do you think the consumer is going to be more active at kind of physical bricks-and-mortar locations?\nSachin Mehra: Sure David. So I think you're touching upon a couple of things which are there on that card-not-present ex travel. The reality is, as cross-border travel comes back, you do see some give back in terms of cross-border card not travel -- card-not-present ex travel. That's a mouthful. So the point is at the end of the day right, there are a few factors you got to take into consideration, when you're thinking about future growth rates for cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. Number one, what's the pace of recovery on cross-border travel is going to be. Number two, what the prior year comps were on cross-border card-not-present ex-travel? Because remember, these growth rates are all influenced by prior comps as well. And what was happening in the COVID environment last year, which might have caused for elevated levels of cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. And number three, you do see fluctuations come in that number through, as a result of crypto and crypto volumes, right? And so, these three factors are kind of things you've got to take into consideration. The point at an up level is the following, which is, the consumer continues to spend in an omnichannel manner. When they can get out and spend in a physical environment, they do that, when they can't spend in a card-not-present environment, they do that. We are ready to support them in both manners, whether it's through our omnichannel capabilities that we're offering our merchants and the strength which we're seeing in card-not-present ex-travel from a cross-border standpoint, is something we expect that strength to actually stay going forward as well. There might be puts and takes for all the reasons I just mentioned, but largely, I think, consumer behavior has changed in a manner where they've gone more digital and you're going to see some strength come through out there.\nDavid Togut: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with question.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick clarifications. On the Russia-Ukraine, I heard the two points to net revenue targets to the performance objectives 2022 to 2024. Could you help us clarify the revenue and expense impact for the going forward quarters like the second quarter, third and fourth this year? Just trying to quantify that. And then, the second question is just what level of cross-border recovery are you assuming in the guidance for 2022? Thanks so much.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Bryan. So, first, I'll take your question on Russia and what we're assuming. So we have suspended operations in Russia, as a result of which we're not earning any revenues related to Russian issued cards. So as it relates to revenue for the rest of the year, we had mentioned that we had put out an 8-K about how Russia represented roughly 4% of our revenues in 2021. And so, we've assumed that that 4% doesn't exist in any of the quarters going forward, from a net revenue standpoint, right? Point number two. And again, like I said in my prepared remarks, there's some level of headwind which we're assuming in Ukraine as well. But the reality is, that's a little bit of an uncertainty, just because we're not entirely sure as to how the war in Ukraine evolves and what the implications of that are. So we built in some assumptions and that's what we've kind of given you in our overall thoughts. From an expense standpoint, the Russia-related expenses represented roughly 2% of our operating expenses. And, again, from an OpEx growth standpoint, kind of, that's the way we think about it. As I mentioned, we have taken down, when we've shared with you our thoughts for full year 2022, we have taken down our OpEx growth rate on an ex-acquisition currency-neutral basis to reflect that very impact from a Russia standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us your latest view on what the kind of longer-term post-pandemic payment [Indiscernible]. I mean, do you see a different longer-term mix of debit versus credit or any associated impacts to P&Ls or yields or anything that we consider as we model out in the long-term.\nMichael Miebach: Right. Ramsey let me start off on that. So the structural changes that we are seeing that we've been observing with our regular consumer engagement surveys over the last two years and that have transpired with our customers as well is less cash and checks, number one. Anything digital more of, number two. The whole -- this whole notion though has changed in the consumers' mind. A couple of things going on. First is, consumers are really ready to move on with the pandemic. They want to go out there, they knock off their bucket list. They want to pent-up demand. So there's a lot of increased spending back into services. So it's not a structural feature of the years to come that it's all in goods. It's going to go back to services and it's going to balance out. It's also not going to be only online, as Sachin just said, it's going to balance out across multi-channel. Buy in-store pickup have delivered, do it the other way around whatever works. I think consumers will go for more choices and that comes right down through our multi-rail strategy to enable basically all relevant choices that are out there. I think that's the right positioning. That's what we're going to see going forward. In terms of debit and credit, if you kind of get a little more granular over here. There was a period in the early parts of the crisis, people will not want to spend on credit if they can avoid it, more control around their finances. That was a big tailwind for debit. We see travel coming back, that's more credit-oriented particularly because of the rewards around it. You start to see in the crypto space, there's a whole new set of credit propositions. We just talked about the Gemini rewards and crypto rewards on that the Nexo Card. So there's a whole thing going on. I think in the end, it's going to be multiplicity around these different tools. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Dan Dolev for Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev : Hi. Thank you for taking -- my question is more specific. If I look at U.S. trends debit versus your competitor, I mean, over the last few quarters, I'm seeing downward trend in your share of the mix in debit and this picture in credit, is there anything to call out there? Is there an opportunity to improve in debit, or am I just missing some very fundamental here? Again just U.S. versus your large competitors. \nSachin Mehra: Yes. So Dan, there's nothing fundamentally which is really changing as it relates to our debit business. I'll put that out there in the first place. Growth rates obviously are impacted by comps. I think you get that piece. I think you've got to take into consideration that there is a one portfolio, which is a debit portfolio, which is rolling off in the U.S., which was previously announced, which is probably impacting that comparative analysis that you're seeing, because obviously, we're seeing the detriment of that comes through in our debit metrics and that primarily started in the recent past and will go on through the course of this year. And the competitor is likely actually getting the benefit of that. So, that's probably the reason you're seeing some of the divergence.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning. I appreciate taking the question. Michael, I actually have a question on other revenues value-added services in particular. Ex-acquisition seems that it's deselling a little bit. Would have perhaps expect to see that growing faster and certainly approaching the growth in the card business. Can you just comment on kind of puts and takes there and what the long-term growth trajectory is for value-added services? \nMichael Miebach: Andrew, excellent questions. As you know we love our services business. It drives growth for us. It's a differentiator. It's a margin increase here. It's all of that. And the key focus is on cyber solutions on one hand and data analytics and inside solutions. This comes back to the structural trend by the way. More data, more digital world \u2013 more digital work to be kept safe. More insights for all these new people that are having businesses online on the data analytics side. So fundamentally there are sound trends here. If you just pick up this quarter and you do the unpacking the numbers that you have just laid out that is simply timing. We are expecting our \u2013 there's nothing to be said that there's anything changing on the growth rates of our business. So that will continue. Our teams are fully engaged and as we looked ahead in the guidance that Sachin gave, we assume a strong services growth. \nSachin Mehra: And I'll just add some \u2013 a little bit more color on that just because I think it's important for you as you're thinking about your models going forward to actually factor this in. When we talk about Russia revenues, there are a few things from a Russia revenue standpoint which you might want to take into consideration one of which relates to the fact that Services was well penetrated in the Russia and Ukraine markets and had strong growth. And so as you think about the model and the impacts across the different line items you're going to see impact related to lost services revenue come through in other revenues in the ensuing quarters. That's kind of point number one. Few other salient pieces on Russia-related revenues as you think about the different line items. Yes we will lose the volumes and transactions. Russia was a fast-growing market. It has no average ticket size which I kind of mentioned earlier. There's a high degree of contactless penetration. Again I think these are important things where you want to kind of keep in mind as you think about comps on a going-forward basis. And the cross-border issuing out of Russia was mostly higher yielding into regional cross-border issuing. Also strong remittances and disbursements market. Why am I sharing all of this with you? Because as you think about the various metrics we've shared across all of these aspects, those will get impacted as Russia starts coming into play in future quarters.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my question guys. Sachin I wanted to ask you called out currency volatility is obviously being a benefit to our first quarter results. Can you isolate what that benefit was in 1Q? Just \u2013 I know it's still a volatile time which is sort of three weeks into the next quarter. But how are you thinking about that looking into 2Q? \nSachin Mehra: Yes. So George, I called it out because Q1 had unusually high foreign exchange volatility. I mean the reality is we don't typically talk about this because these numbers kind of go back and forth from a volatility standpoint but there was unusually high FX volatility in Q1. The outlook from a going forward standpoint is really hard to say. I mean this is one of those things where I guess as Michael jokes with me \"Sachin you wouldn't be doing the job if you knew where volatility was going on a forward basis for foreign exchange.\" So the point is at the end of the day we've taken our best assumptions on a holistic basis for our business share with you what our thoughts are from a full year and a Q2 basis on net revenue. Very hard to predict what the outlook going forward is going to be. Unusually high volatility does help us. The other thing to keep in mind is since it's related to cross-border volumes as to for volumes come back that combined with unusually high volatility has that much more of an impact.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Jameria, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our final question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. Just a quick one, so just in terms of your expectation for cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels, last quarter you were expecting to be at 100% by the end of this year. You're already at 110% in April. So what's your updated assumption on that?\nSachin Mehra: Jason, as I mentioned we're assuming improving trends vis-\u00e0-vis compared to 2019 as we go forward. We're not sharing a specific number for what that looks like in the second quarter or the end of the year. We've built in our expectations in terms of the revenue guidance I've shared with you our thoughts around how that trend takes place. The combination of that was consumer spending and what the improving trajectory in consumer spending is, it's all factored into the numbers.\nJason Kupferberg: Can we get a directional rebates and incentives just for the rest of the year?\nSachin Mehra: So think I mentioned to you on rebates and incentives is the following which is, we have a rich pipeline of deals. We continue to execute on that as you heard from Michael, in terms of some of the wins which we had recently. Obviously, you get the benefit of improving cross-border trends to play through in terms of lower amounts of business incentives impacting that. And the last point I'll make on rebate and incentive is, in Q1 we had this onetime benefit relating to the non-renewal of our Russian customer agreement which you should not expect the benefit of that to come through on a going-forward basis. So net-net I would tell you that, a lot of this is going to be dependent on what the timing of deals are? How we put those new into deals into play? And what the recovery of cross-border is going to be.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks Sachin. Michael?\nMichael Miebach: All right. So thanks for your questions, insightful questions as always. Thank you for support for the company. Just a thought for me, here we're thinking that we're going to get out of Omicron and then a few days later we have an invasion in Europe. So for our teams, it's around the world it continues to be a never-ending marathon. And I just want to extend the thanks to everybody in the Mastercard team. And with that, we'll see you next quarter. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 27% reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. Acquisitions contributed two ppt to this group. These revenues were above expectation primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border and domestic volumes favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues. Operating expenses increased 13% including a six ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 40% which includes a one ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 61%, which includes a 20 ppt benefit due to the recognition of a one-time discrete tax benefit related to a US tax regulation published in the current period and a one ppt decrease from acquisitions. EPS was up 65% year-over-year to $2.76, which includes a $0.36 contribution from the one-time discrete tax benefit and a $0.05 from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $599 million through April 25th, 2022. So, let's turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Of note, data related to sanctioned Russian banks was not reported to us and hence such amounts are not included in Q1 2022. In the US, GDV increased by 14% with credit growth of 31% and debit growth of 1%, reflecting the recovery of credit spending on travel and the lapping of stimulus. Outside of the US, volume increased 19% with credit growth of 20% and debit growth of 18%. Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 50% and other third quarter volumes up 56%, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, cross-border volume was above 2019 levels for all regions and cross-border travel was above 2019 levels for the first time in March. Turning now to page five. Switched transactions grew 22% year-over-year in Q1 and were at 150% of 2019 levels. Card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. With respect to card counts, as a result of the suspension of our business operations in Russia, cards issued by Russian banks are no longer active on our network and are therefore excluded from our card counts this quarter. So, accordingly card growth was lower at 4% this quarter. If you exclude Russian issued cards from current and prior years, our growth would have been 9%. Globally, the 2.9 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now, let's look to page six with our highlights on the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 27% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed approximately two ppt to this growth. I also like to point out that in the first quarter the suspension of business operations in Russia had a minimal impact to the overall growth rate of the company as the loss of volume was offset by a onetime benefit of lower rebates and incentives due to the absence of a customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 21% while worldwide GDV grew 17%. The four ppt difference is primarily due to unreported volumes from Russian-related sanction customers and a favorable mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 57%, while cross-border volumes increased 53% both ahead of expectations. The full ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex-intra Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 27% while switched transactions grew 22%. The five ppt difference is primarily due to favorable cross-border mix and FX-related revenues. Other revenues were up 20% including a seven ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 30% reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. As a percentage of gross revenues rebates and incentives were lower than expected primarily due to the absence of a planned customer incentive agreement renewal in Russia, a higher mix of cross-border revenues and the timing of new internode deals. Moving to page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral basis total operating expenses increased 13% including a six ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions operating expenses grew 7% primarily due to increased spending on advertising and marketing higher personnel costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives and increased data processing costs. Turning to page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of April. For your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex-Russia, we have included an appendix later in the deck to show all the data points from the schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods. Going through the metrics in turn. Starting with switch volumes. For the first three weeks of April, we grew 23% year-over-year down four ppt versus Q1 primarily due to the cessation of activities in Russia. If you exclude Russia-related volumes from the current and prior periods switch volumes grew 27% down one ppt versus Q1. Switch transactions grew 14% year-over-year through the first three weeks of April down eight ppt from Q1 again driven primarily by the absence of Russia-related transactions. Of note Russia has a relatively low average ticket size which results in a larger relative impact to this metric. If you exclude Russia-related transactions from the current and prior periods switched transactions grew by 25% year-over-year up one ppt versus Q1. Overall cross-border volumes through the first three weeks of April grew 60% year-over-year up seven ppt versus Q1. Excluding Russia from the current and prior periods cross-border volumes through the same period grew 65% year-over-year up 13 pp versus Q1.  Since the end of January cross-border travel has rebounded quickly as border restrictions continue to be lifted and we distance ourselves from Omicron. In the first three weeks of April, cross-border travel was up 179% year-over-year up 38 ppt versus Q1. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel was up 5% year-over-year in April, a decrease of 8 ppt compared to Q1, reflecting in part the lapping of a strong comparable period a year ago. One point to emphasize is cross-border travel is now above pre-pandemic levels at 110% of 2019 levels. Turning to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of 2022. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong, as we continue to grow our customer relationships and expand our product and service offerings. As Michael mentioned, consumer spending remains robust, particularly as economies open further and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Having said this, we are monitoring a number of factors, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and COVID infection rates. At this stage, we have not seen any significant impact of these and consumer spending. Cross-border travel is recovering rapidly as border restrictions ease. This is occurring faster than our earlier expectations. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios. Weighing against these positive trends are the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the suspension of our business operations in Russia. So now taking all of this into account, we continue to expect net revenues for full year 2022 to grow at the high end of a high teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. So, essentially, we are maintaining our growth expectations in the same range as the strong cross-border travel recovery and strength in consumer spending helped mitigate the loss of sizable revenues in Russia and Ukraine. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of three to four ppt for the year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro. In terms of operating expenses, we are reducing our forecast for the year to reflect cost savings related to Russia. All year, we expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about four to five ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately two to three ppt for the year. With respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a high teens rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects closely strong consumer spending, including continued improvement in cross-border travel spending relative to 2019. Secondly the discontinuation of revenues from Russia and a sequential reduction in revenues related to Ukraine. And finally, the lapping of a strong year good quarter that was aided by fiscal stimulus and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, as vaccination programs rolled out. Acquisitions are forecast to add about one ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately five to six ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about four to five ppt to this growth, including the acquisition of Dynamic Yield, which we are pleased to have just closed. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately three to four ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $115 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% for each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year based on the current geographic mix of our business. Before closing out, I want to briefly comment on our three year performance objectives for 2022 to 2024. Clearly, the elimination of Russia-related revenues and the reduction of those from Ukraine create a headwind to achieving these objectives. If this would continue, it would result in a headwind of approximately two ppt to our net revenue CAGR. Having said this, we are off to a strong start in 2022 with the recovery of cross-border travel ahead of expectations, as I previously mentioned. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth for the company. And net-net, it is really too early to adjust our three year performance objectives, as we work to offset some or all of these headwinds. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Thanks, Harshita. So first on your question on cross-border, you're absolutely right. Cross-border travel has actually come back stronger than our expectations and there continues to be pent-up demand. And we in terms of how we're thinking about our guidance, we've kind of built in that improving recovery in cross-border travel on a going-forward basis as well. So I just want to kind of get that out there. But to give you a little bit more color right on cross-border. So cross-border volumes are above 2019 levels across all regions for the first time. I would tell you that, the top 20 destinations which represented approximately 70% of our total cross-border travel pre-pandemic, and we're at 70% of 2019 levels when we discussed this at our Investor Community Meeting, are now at 85% in Q1 of 2022. Specifically, on your question around Asia-Pacific, I think it's important to note that Asia Pacific has been slower to recover. The Asia Pacific opportunity as I see this is as follows: Asia Pacific represented approximately 14% of total inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic and we're at 40% of our 2019 levels in Q1. So as you can see from this number right that, there is a fair amount of recovery still remaining to come from Asia Pacific. Obviously, it does matter in terms of how restrictions are lifted in that market. Again, the point is at the end of the day cross-border fundamentally is still very sound. This is something we've been talking about right through the pandemic, where we felt like when restrictions are eased volumes in cross-border will come back. We've seen that happen and we continue to believe fundamentally that that remains very much in place on EP in particular, a couple of thoughts in China. One the \u2013 both China both from an inbound and an outbound standpoint where not a very significant portion of our cross-border volumes pre-pandemic. In fact, I would argue that, the outbound China was slightly higher than the inbound China. So when you think about recovery you've also got to think about what restrictions are there in terms of people going into countries versus people coming out of countries. And I would tell you outbound China has shown better improvement than inbound China for obvious reasons as we all know that, there have been locked out in China and things of that sort. So net-net as I said back and I think about this I think about the fundamentals of cross-border being strong. I think about the potential for pent-up demand continue to contribute to improvements in cross-border travel spend. And again, the Asia Pacific region still remains a fairly large opportunity on a going forward basis. Yes. Rayna, happy to take that question. So look I mean at the end of the day, you know that, the business as we have it is a high operating leverage business, right? At the end of the day incremental dollars of revenue typically flow to the bottom line just given the nature of how we operate. So certainly cross-border recovery is playing into the recovery in operating margins but it's not just about cross-border. It's about overall strong consumer spending and cross-border travel recovery all of, which is contributing to the delivery of improved operating margins. Helping that even further is the good new strength in our services and everything we're doing along those parts. So it's everything which we are doing in terms of driving the fundamentals of our business back to the strategic priorities Michael was talking about, which is growing our payments keeping on leaning in on services and then continue to invest in the new network space which is really important. So all of those factors are contributing factors to the expanding operating margins that you're seeing come through. The message I'd like to leave you with on this is the following: We continue to run the business for long-term sustainable growth, which means effectively that we're going to continue to invest in a disciplined manner to ensure that we are creating the right opportunities for ourselves to deliver this long-term top line growth. And while we do that you should see the impact of that come through in terms of operating margins.\nA \u2013 Warren Kneeshaw: Next question, please. Thanks, Aaron. I'll take the first part and then Michael will address your second question. I guess the headline is the following which is, we're not seeing anything fundamentally changed in terms of the profile of our cross-border revenues. I mean net-net things are going to move around depending on how much cross-border comes from intra-Europe versus volumes from outside of that intra-Europe corridor because as you know intra-Europe is lower yielding and then other cross-border volumes are higher yielding. But fundamentally, I would tell you not much has changed. I will make one point. You talked about rebates and incentives not being there with cross-border. I would say that there's a lower indexation of rebates and incentives to cross-border. There's always been some level of rebates incentives, which have been associated with cross-border not nearly as high as what's there in the domestic volume environment. But we're not seeing fundamentally much change in that regard. And I'll just add Michael a couple of thoughts on Brazil. One you asked the question about the strong growth. Clearly, it's a combination of the macro environment, but it's also the fact that we've been leaning in pretty heavily with our traditional issuers as well as our fintech partners in that space which has been part of the reason why we've been seeing some of that growth come through in a decent manner, Lisa. The second point I'd make tying back to Michael's comments around PICCs [ph], the market has to be bifurcated in the context of both debit and credit. And on the credit side, we continue to see tremendous growth. PICCs -- which Michael said is primarily catering to P2P and B2B flows, even if it were to actually proliferate a little bit into call it the smaller merchants from a P2M standpoint were primarily be focused around the debit side of the equation and so credit still remains the mainstay for us in Brazil as it stands. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So everything we kind of talked about and Michael talked about earlier on in this conversation was about our expanding relationships with these issuers. And so with these issuers, we are gaining share. That's kind of the reality of the situation. Again, there are puts and takes in the market, right? So as I think about the new relationship well I should say new relationship, the expanded relationship we have with Wells, right, that's an increasing share position with Wells which is taking place for example there. So the bottom line is the following which is whether it's Wells, Capital One, what we're doing with Santander and NatWest, Deutsche -- you name it the GAAP portfolio all of these incrementally are helping us drive our volumes. From a holistic market standpoint, again, like I said, there are puts and takes, right? But we're very, very optimistic about how we are seeing business translate for us. And as we mentioned at the Investor Community Day, we are growing market share across all regions and the market share growth which we've seen in 16 of our top 20 markets which is something we shared with you at the Investor Community Day is really the data points we put out so far. Sure David. So I think you're touching upon a couple of things which are there on that card-not-present ex travel. The reality is, as cross-border travel comes back, you do see some give back in terms of cross-border card not travel -- card-not-present ex travel. That's a mouthful. So the point is at the end of the day right, there are a few factors you got to take into consideration, when you're thinking about future growth rates for cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. Number one, what's the pace of recovery on cross-border travel is going to be. Number two, what the prior year comps were on cross-border card-not-present ex-travel? Because remember, these growth rates are all influenced by prior comps as well. And what was happening in the COVID environment last year, which might have caused for elevated levels of cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. And number three, you do see fluctuations come in that number through, as a result of crypto and crypto volumes, right? And so, these three factors are kind of things you've got to take into consideration. The point at an up level is the following, which is, the consumer continues to spend in an omnichannel manner. When they can get out and spend in a physical environment, they do that, when they can't spend in a card-not-present environment, they do that. We are ready to support them in both manners, whether it's through our omnichannel capabilities that we're offering our merchants and the strength which we're seeing in card-not-present ex-travel from a cross-border standpoint, is something we expect that strength to actually stay going forward as well. There might be puts and takes for all the reasons I just mentioned, but largely, I think, consumer behavior has changed in a manner where they've gone more digital and you're going to see some strength come through out there. Sure, Bryan. So, first, I'll take your question on Russia and what we're assuming. So we have suspended operations in Russia, as a result of which we're not earning any revenues related to Russian issued cards. So as it relates to revenue for the rest of the year, we had mentioned that we had put out an 8-K about how Russia represented roughly 4% of our revenues in 2021. And so, we've assumed that that 4% doesn't exist in any of the quarters going forward, from a net revenue standpoint, right? Point number two. And again, like I said in my prepared remarks, there's some level of headwind which we're assuming in Ukraine as well. But the reality is, that's a little bit of an uncertainty, just because we're not entirely sure as to how the war in Ukraine evolves and what the implications of that are. So we built in some assumptions and that's what we've kind of given you in our overall thoughts. From an expense standpoint, the Russia-related expenses represented roughly 2% of our operating expenses. And, again, from an OpEx growth standpoint, kind of, that's the way we think about it. As I mentioned, we have taken down, when we've shared with you our thoughts for full year 2022, we have taken down our OpEx growth rate on an ex-acquisition currency-neutral basis to reflect that very impact from a Russia standpoint. Yes. So Dan, there's nothing fundamentally which is really changing as it relates to our debit business. I'll put that out there in the first place. Growth rates obviously are impacted by comps. I think you get that piece. I think you've got to take into consideration that there is a one portfolio, which is a debit portfolio, which is rolling off in the U.S., which was previously announced, which is probably impacting that comparative analysis that you're seeing, because obviously, we're seeing the detriment of that comes through in our debit metrics and that primarily started in the recent past and will go on through the course of this year. And the competitor is likely actually getting the benefit of that. So, that's probably the reason you're seeing some of the divergence. And I'll just add some \u2013 a little bit more color on that just because I think it's important for you as you're thinking about your models going forward to actually factor this in. When we talk about Russia revenues, there are a few things from a Russia revenue standpoint which you might want to take into consideration one of which relates to the fact that Services was well penetrated in the Russia and Ukraine markets and had strong growth. And so as you think about the model and the impacts across the different line items you're going to see impact related to lost services revenue come through in other revenues in the ensuing quarters. That's kind of point number one. Few other salient pieces on Russia-related revenues as you think about the different line items. Yes we will lose the volumes and transactions. Russia was a fast-growing market. It has no average ticket size which I kind of mentioned earlier. There's a high degree of contactless penetration. Again I think these are important things where you want to kind of keep in mind as you think about comps on a going-forward basis. And the cross-border issuing out of Russia was mostly higher yielding into regional cross-border issuing. Also strong remittances and disbursements market. Why am I sharing all of this with you? Because as you think about the various metrics we've shared across all of these aspects, those will get impacted as Russia starts coming into play in future quarters. Yes. So George, I called it out because Q1 had unusually high foreign exchange volatility. I mean the reality is we don't typically talk about this because these numbers kind of go back and forth from a volatility standpoint but there was unusually high FX volatility in Q1. The outlook from a going forward standpoint is really hard to say. I mean this is one of those things where I guess as Michael jokes with me \"Sachin you wouldn't be doing the job if you knew where volatility was going on a forward basis for foreign exchange.\" So the point is at the end of the day we've taken our best assumptions on a holistic basis for our business share with you what our thoughts are from a full year and a Q2 basis on net revenue. Very hard to predict what the outlook going forward is going to be. Unusually high volatility does help us. The other thing to keep in mind is since it's related to cross-border volumes as to for volumes come back that combined with unusually high volatility has that much more of an impact. Jason, as I mentioned we're assuming improving trends vis-a\u0300-vis compared to 2019 as we go forward. We're not sharing a specific number for what that looks like in the second quarter or the end of the year. We've built in our expectations in terms of the revenue guidance I've shared with you our thoughts around how that trend takes place. The combination of that was consumer spending and what the improving trajectory in consumer spending is, it's all factored into the numbers. So think I mentioned to you on rebates and incentives is the following which is, we have a rich pipeline of deals. We continue to execute on that as you heard from Michael, in terms of some of the wins which we had recently. Obviously, you get the benefit of improving cross-border trends to play through in terms of lower amounts of business incentives impacting that. And the last point I'll make on rebate and incentive is, in Q1 we had this onetime benefit relating to the non-renewal of our Russian customer agreement which you should not expect the benefit of that to come through on a going-forward basis. So net-net I would tell you that, a lot of this is going to be dependent on what the timing of deals are? How we put those new into deals into play? And what the recovery of cross-border is going to be."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Russia's invasion of Ukraine marked a somber start to 2022, as war returned to Europe for the first time in decades. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we decided to suspend our business operations in Russia. We did not take this decision lightly, given that Mastercard has operated in Russia for more than 25 years. We are now focused on the orderly suspension of business operations in Russia and supporting the well-being of our employees and their families across the whole region. Even in the context of this challenging geopolitical environment, we're off to a strong start in 2022. We delivered robust revenue and earnings growth with further improvement in our underlying operating metrics, notably in cross-border travel. Quarter one adjusted net revenues were up 27% and adjusted operating income up 40% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis. On the macroeconomic front, consumer spending remains strong, particularly as economies across the globe continue to reopen and pandemic-related restrictions are lifted. Labor markets are firm, with low unemployment rates and rising wages. Weighing against this healthy backdrop are a number of factors that they are monitoring, including inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints geopolitical uncertainties and COVID with infection rates. We're monitoring these developments including the fiscal, monitory, public health care and other policy responses. Let's look at this from a geographic standpoint. US retail spending remains healthy, aided in part by the buildup of excess savings during the pandemic. According to our quarter one spending pulse report, which is based on all payment types, including cash and check, US retail sales ex-auto, ex-gas were up 4.7% versus a year ago. In Europe, spending trends are positive, although the invasion of Ukraine has introduced risks to economic growth looking ahead. Growth in Latin America continues to moderate, following a strong rebound in 2021. Asia has generally lagged the recovery of other regions. We're seeing several countries relaxing COVID-related restrictions, like others are facing stronger measures. Asia continues to have significant upside potential. Looking at Mastercard spending trends, we continue to see strong growth. Domestic switched volumes or strength across a broad range of sectors including retail, utilities and professional spend. We also saw strong growth in travel and entertainment including spending with airlines, travel agencies, lodging and restaurants. In terms of cross-border where the growth was particularly strong the recovery continued this quarter led by travel. Cross-border travel reached 2019 levels as of March for the first time since the pandemic began. Geographically, the cross-border recovery has been broad-based with improvement across all regions. Cross-border card not present ex-travel continues to be strong. Our strategy is designed to enable and capitalize on these trends and executing against our three key strategic priorities: one expanding in payments, two extending our services and three embracing new networks. Here is an update on how we're progressing against each of those. First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to grow card payments and leaning into innovation and new payment technologies to catch-up other prioritized payment flows. We're driving growth in comp payments through new consumer, small business, co-brand and fintech wins. On the consumer and small business front, I'm excited to announce an enhanced partnership with Wells Fargo which includes several new elements. Wells Fargo will now issue Mastercard small business credit cards and for the first time in almost a decade, consumer proprietary and co-brand credit products. We're also excited to announce that we have deepened our relationship with our long-standing partner, Capital One. In addition to renewing our existing business, we will also be their issuing network for a larger number of new originations across both their consumer and small business products. Further on the small business front, we are expanding our small business portfolio with the First National Bank of Omaha, also partnering with the bank and Verizon to launch a new Verizon business Mastercard targeting Verizon's small business customers. In total, these partnerships will help us continue growing our U.S. small business market share. Outside the U.S. we're driving commercial card growth through new partnerships with leading B2B tech companies like Clara. We will be flipping Clara's business portfolio in Mexico to MasterCard and are working for them to launch new programs in five additional markets across Latin America. Turning to co-brands, we've made substantial progress to ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel. We have renewed and expanded our exclusive partnership with American Airlines, one of the largest co-brand programs in the United States. American will continue to leverage our capabilities including SessionM and will participate in our Staff cast program to identify in tech partners who can help drive innovation across the airline. And in the U.K. we have launched two new Barclaycard Avios cards with Barclays and International Airlines Group loyalty. Outside of travel we've expanded our relationships with leading retailers including a new co-brand program with Victoria's Secret and a renewal of our Ulta Beauty co-brand offering both in partnership with Red Financial. We're also continuing to advance our leadership in the digital and fintech space, through new product launches and new partnerships. We're partnering with BCA Digital, the digital banking arm of the largest private bank in Indonesia to launch a digital-first Mastercard debit product catering to millennials. And in Latin America we signed a regional partnership with global payment processing platform Galileo. The partnership establishes Mastercard as Galileo preferred partner across several markets in Latin America and they will work to integrate and distribute several of our products and services to help their fintech customers. In addition to driving new wins, we are leveraging our services capabilities to execute against many of the large portfolio migrations that are in flight. In Europe, our consulting teams are engaging with our partners at Santander, NatWest and Deutsche Bank to ensure a smooth and timely transition and to identify opportunities to optimize those portfolios. Santander is the bulk of the way through a nine million card migration and we expected to be complete by early next year, while NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard at the end of last year and plans to migrate their entire 16 million card portfolio by the middle of 2023. Deutsche Bank's $10 million consumer and commercial credit and debit cards will be reissued as Mastercard-branded cards with a credit migration starting in quarter four of this year and the debit migration commencing early next year. Similarly our team in the US is supporting key migrations including Gap Inc., Merrick Bank, and First Interstate Bank. All the migrations are on track with Gap Inc. scheduled to be completed this summer. We're also expanding in payments by leading entertainment innovation in areas like installments and cryptocurrencies. Here are a few examples. Our Openbit [ph] Mastercard installment program has been very well received and is progressing according to plan. Remember Mastercard installment is built into our network making by Buy Now Pay Later available to millions of consumers and merchants worldwide. We continue to add a wide array of new lender and fintech partners including Amount, Deserve, i2c, Lithic and Southern Bank. In this quarter, we announced several merchant partners who are excited to support MasterCard installments including Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, H&R Block, Saks Fifth Avenue and Walgreens. US customers will begin offering MasterCard installments to consumers this quarter and international expansion is planned for later this year. And we continue to build solutions to support the crypto economy with a principled approach focused on three key areas. First, helping consumers easily and safely purchase cryptocurrencies and NFTs. In addition we are enabling consumers to spend their crypto holdings on card and catching up their crypto wallets via MasterCard Send. Second, providing identity, cyber and consulting services for market participants, including engaging with central banks as they design and develop central bank digital currencies. Third, preparing our core network to directly support digital currencies. Making substantial progress in each of these areas. This quarter the Gemini Mastercard, which offers crypto rewards went live across the US. We also partner with Nexo to launch a new crypto card in Europe, one that uses consumers' digital assets as collateral to back their credit line. And we established several other international cryptocard partnerships including banks in Europe and Abra, Invesco and Bello in Latin America. On the crypto services front, MercadoLibre will be leveraging psychotraces AI and cyber capabilities to bring security and trust to their digital wallet in Brazil. Now turning to our second strategic priority services, as I've noted before, our services support and differentiate our core products and have played a critical role enabling many of the wins I mentioned. We also continue to extend our services across multiple growth vectors through new payment platform capabilities, new verticals and new use cases. Here are a few examples. First, earlier this month we completed our acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Now that the transaction is closed, we will combine Dynamic Yield personalization platform and decision engine within our SessionM loyalty platform and our test-and-learn experimentation software. The result will be a truly differentiated consumer engagement and loyalty hub for our customers. Second, we announced that we're expanding our consulting services into three new practices dedicated to open banking and open data, crypto and digital currencies and ESG. We've seen increased customer demand and a growing portfolio of successful engagements in these areas. For example, we are supporting Handelsbanken and Intesa Sanpaolo design programs that advance their ESG priorities. We're helping Wirex explore innovations in crypto. And finally, we're expanding the breadth of our customer base and deploying our capabilities to solve for a wider range of use cases. For example, we deployed our Test & Learn capabilities to help tailored brands, optimize retail operations and improve marketing efficiency for the leading menswear brands. And deployed our FX capabilities with Santander in Spain to help streamline dispute resolutions and prove the customer experience. Beyond expanding in payments and extending and services, our third key priority area is embracing new networks. Our current focus is on two areas: open banking and digital identity. Our open banking and multi-rail strategies are converging enabling us to leverage our unique set of assets to address new flows in verticals, like rent payments. For rent payments, the risk of ACH returns due to insufficient funds is a significant pain point in both renters and landlords. To address this challenge, we're launching a new suite of smart payment decisioning tools. These solutions use Finicity's open banking capabilities to recommend the optimal payment day and payment rail for each transaction based on cost, speed and risk. The Bill Payment Alliance, a collection of more than two million rental homes will be one of the first fintech partners to launch these capabilities. We plan to expand these solutions across a broad range of bill payment verticals. In addition, we continue to expand our open banking reach with Finicity and Aiia, by penetrating new verticals and establishing new partnerships. We continue to enhance our capabilities at the mortgage vertical and are now expanding into the auto lending vertical. We're leading the way in terms of provisioning permission-based income, employment and asset verification information and we've partnered with Stripe, who will be using our open banking capabilities for a variety of use cases. We're also extending our open banking reach through data access agreements with products like Fiserv, which will enable direct API connectivity to thousands of FIs in the United States. In the digital identity space, Ekata continued its strong performance in quarter one, securing deals with financial services companies including MoneyLine and several leading Buy Now Pay Later providers. In addition, we recently joined forces with Microsoft and a collaboration to improve digital transaction approval rates and reduce fraud. The solution enables issuers to optimize authorization decisions using network and merchant-specific authentication data. Combined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction and into new digital transactions. These are attractive and growing opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to be successful in both. In summary, our business fundamentals remain strong and we delivered robust revenue and earnings growth again this quarter, which also reflects our disciplined approach to expense management. We're executing against our strategic priorities notably expanding our share with key issuers. In addition, we've worked hard to expand our travel-oriented portfolios which positions us well to capitalize on a strong recovery in cross-border travel. And last but not least, we want to reflect on what is most important, the safety and well being of our employees and their families who have been impacted by the war. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Ukraine. Sachin, over to you. Sanjay, thanks for your question. So on the inflation side, as Sachin mentioned earlier, we have not seen anything yet in terms of changing consumer spending behaviors. But what we are seeing is in terms of the impact on vertical mix and so forth. There has been a 1% increase in our switched volume that's related to gas price increases. We're seeing some shifts in the airline. That is again under an inflationary pressure there from ticket pricing perspective. So we have to see where it goes going forward. I mean fundamentally, where I stand on this is the push by consumers into the digital space. They learn these habits they're online. All that will continue. And we'll see where the underlying prices go and then comes back to what we've been saying all along. There's macro considerations in each country that has to be considered here. What is monetary fiscal policy and then there is the micro aspects of the different verticals which ones of those are carded which ones we would see which ones we wouldn't see. Could there be a crowding out effect of rents or gas prices particularly in Europe? Yes that might be but that's not something we can tell yet. Yes. If I can just build on that, we love cross-border. But while we love the trends, it's a lot of hard work. And over the last two years, I mean, the travel industry was hard hit from the outset of the pandemic. We have leaned in. And as I recall over the last two years JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, LatAm, Aeroplan, AirCanada you name it it's a long list of where we have either expanded renewed one additional volume. So we're participating in the trend in a very significant way. And we've always said, it's going to happen this year and we're ready for that. Right. And strategically, so Darrin here's what I'd say is similar lens that we took at Investor Day where we looked at different universes and different use cases. You got the P2M world where card is well established domestically but also certainly cross-border. The industry and we very specifically with our services propositions have found a way to ensure that the risks associated with these cross-border transactions for merchants and for consumers are addressed. So the conversion rates and the approval rates have continuously increased. And there's a lot of value brought. So there isn't much of a problem to be resolved to payment for payments for goods on a cross-border basis.  Now where we're actively looking in our -- it tends to participate in all relevant payment flows. We're saying what other payment volumes happening cross-border that we can contribute to with our technology through our franchise and so forth. And here the whole space of import-export, cross-border and accounts payable. That's a space where a counter-account solutions make sense for us to hold.  We have specifically called out for you at the Investor Day the focus on remittances. Again, that's a significant opportunity for us. That's all additive and expensive from a target market perspective from an opportunity perspective. Attractive growing opportunities. We have the technology on the cross-border remittances side our Transfast acquisition, our buyout on the HomeSend side all of that is coming together. It's a 100 country reach.  So I think what we're bringing here is the multilateral network idea into this space that has been historically inefficient. So, I look at it as a growth opportunity while we're going to continue to power the cost side of the house. All right. So let me take that. So first of all, Brazil has been a market in focused strategically important market for us for years. We're very well established on with the large banks out there Itau and others to mention. So, I'm actually seeing the Brazilian country manager right after this call. So, it's very much in focus. We're very happy with what's going on there. Overall, it's a market that drives a lot of innovation.  Buy Now, Pay Later has been a thing in Brazil forever. Open banking is on the rise, real-time payments is on the rise. So, a lot of movement there. And the P2P network that's been introduced by the Central Bank in the Brazil market is another push to further digitization in that market. So, the whole digitization in Brazil is really seeing great momentum and we're leaning right into that.  Now the kind of flow that PIX is going after, you see a lot of P2P flows and some B2B flows, so that's not necessarily anything that we're particularly worried about but it's also the kind of flows as part of our multi-rail strategy that we like to support ourselves and we have a whole set of technologies for that. What's have paid just to point one out which is the first live in Brazil itself is set a market with innovation and a lot of momentum there.  So, here's our technology powering a social network as an alternative which is an easy user experience great adoption 4.7 million users already on that platform. So, I look at it as a market that's a lot to learn from, a market that we invest in and where we chart passed for the new additional flows beyond card flows very with specific local solutions considering the size of the market. And Tien-Tsin, I should add, I'm very happy to ask the question. I thought these news was just going to pass by with none of you asking about it, so it's much appreciated. Right. Ramsey let me start off on that. So the structural changes that we are seeing that we've been observing with our regular consumer engagement surveys over the last two years and that have transpired with our customers as well is less cash and checks, number one. Anything digital more of, number two. The whole -- this whole notion though has changed in the consumers' mind. A couple of things going on. First is, consumers are really ready to move on with the pandemic. They want to go out there, they knock off their bucket list. They want to pent-up demand. So there's a lot of increased spending back into services. So it's not a structural feature of the years to come that it's all in goods. It's going to go back to services and it's going to balance out. It's also not going to be only online, as Sachin just said, it's going to balance out across multi-channel. Buy in-store pickup have delivered, do it the other way around whatever works. I think consumers will go for more choices and that comes right down through our multi-rail strategy to enable basically all relevant choices that are out there. I think that's the right positioning. That's what we're going to see going forward. In terms of debit and credit, if you kind of get a little more granular over here. There was a period in the early parts of the crisis, people will not want to spend on credit if they can avoid it, more control around their finances. That was a big tailwind for debit. We see travel coming back, that's more credit-oriented particularly because of the rewards around it. You start to see in the crypto space, there's a whole new set of credit propositions. We just talked about the Gemini rewards and crypto rewards on that the Nexo Card. So there's a whole thing going on. I think in the end, it's going to be multiplicity around these different tools. Andrew, excellent questions. As you know we love our services business. It drives growth for us. It's a differentiator. It's a margin increase here. It's all of that. And the key focus is on cyber solutions on one hand and data analytics and inside solutions. This comes back to the structural trend by the way. More data, more digital world \u2013 more digital work to be kept safe. More insights for all these new people that are having businesses online on the data analytics side. So fundamentally there are sound trends here. If you just pick up this quarter and you do the unpacking the numbers that you have just laid out that is simply timing. We are expecting our \u2013 there's nothing to be said that there's anything changing on the growth rates of our business. So that will continue. Our teams are fully engaged and as we looked ahead in the guidance that Sachin gave, we assume a strong services growth. All right. So thanks for your questions, insightful questions as always. Thank you for support for the company. Just a thought for me, here we're thinking that we're going to get out of Omicron and then a few days later we have an invasion in Europe. So for our teams, it's around the world it continues to be a never-ending marathon. And I just want to extend the thanks to everybody in the Mastercard team. And with that, we'll see you next quarter. Thank you so much. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Briana, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Incorporated Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Briana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then, that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non- GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter four net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique diversified products and services both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we're monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely and we'll manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy and cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities which fuel our growth algorithm across payments and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of five key areas. One, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies. Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions. Three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flow. And four, growing market share, and five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the runway for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We're now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app, and larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. We're supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023 expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the UK, France, Brazil and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed-loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, which creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems. However, there's still significant runway for us given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure and password-free checkout solutions and with that bring an elevated level of security, simplicity and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser, or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness. For Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving tokenization across all channels including devices, commerce platforms, card on file and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia-Pacific region. We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account to account and new flows. This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. Debit portfolio to Mastercard, making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy, will migrate their debit card portfolio to Mastercard as well. We renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia where we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios. We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expands into new services including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial, consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, Mastercard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment and neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. This quarter, Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the UK renewed their partnership with Mastercard. In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J. Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services, while always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and in turn further drive services growth. Looking to China, we are thrilled that our joint venture in China has released formal approval to commence domestic bankcard clearing. Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first world Mastercard product in November and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card. Beyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with The Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real time payments in the United States. Now shifting gears, we continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR, two of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium and on the virtual card front, we announced two exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda. Turning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. Payments, services and new networks reinforce each other. We said it countless times. Our services and new networks provide differentiation as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too and payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transactions, more need for fraud tools and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types and continuing to build and deploy new services. Here are a few examples how we are executing against each of these. The past year Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This is on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio lifecycle management. Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly to their bank app. Now with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file. Square is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chose Mastercard as a strategic partner to rollout open banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud. And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with Generative AI. Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, and makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We're working on many GenAI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced Shopping Muse. Shopping Muse uses Generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers' colloquial language into tailored recommendations. Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year, will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard Access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI digital and identity services. Using access customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks including those outside the Mastercard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities. So with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a non-recurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the UK. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup. Turning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first four weeks of January. Starting with switch volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all Mastercard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps. Moving to the first four weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impacts from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year-over-year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio. Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first four weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to show strength. Turning now to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events, and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As it relates to the full-year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year. Now turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter. Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by two factors: First, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year. And second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace, from a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\nDevin Corr: Thank you. Briana, you may open the call for questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: I want to ask about U.S. card volumes. So weather aside, the growth has decelerated a bit to mid-single-digit levels versus what we've seen in the last 5 to 10 years, especially if you compare that to PC. So how should we think about kind of a normalized card volume growth in the U.S? Or is there simply more runway, a number of transactions. So that's the metric we should be watching? And also, just as a follow-up, can you also comment on Reg II impact on U.S. bonds?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Harshita. Let me take those questions. First, on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint, we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far on the data. Obviously, we will keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact. On your question around U.S. card volume growth. Look, at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S., there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity, both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume and a transaction standpoint. But more specifically, what I'd tell you is the following, which is in the release of the U.S. We've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place, i.e., is it taking place in carded volumes? Or is it taking place in non-carded categories of spend? So as you do the analysis, at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is, we look at PCE, we think about, on a normalized basis, if inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity, which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint. Now in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S. continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active. We're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers. We've had good wins on the debit space, which, as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S. So overall, I tell you from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth, driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift as well as share. And again, what I\u2019m talking about is, on the card payment volume side of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners.\nCraig Maurer : So two questions. One, to what degree are conversions of new wins contributing to fiscal year '24 guidance? And secondly, regarding China, knowing that you need to launch your business there within six months of approval. I was wondering if you could characterize conversations with issuers there and whether you've been able to keep warm relationships with those issuers over the years, considering you're in a very strong position in China when regulations changed, whatever it was 7, 8 years ago?\nMichael Miebach: Right. Let me take the China question first and we come back to the conversion topic that you raised. So needless to say, we're thrilled about China. So this is a -- it's a massive economy, and we feel we're well positioned to serve it. As I said in my remarks at the beginning, we feel we're uniquely positioned to put into the hand of Chinese consumers a solution -- a seamless solution that works domestically as well as when they travel. That's not unique. There's another competitor that has that kind of a proposition. But we do have the much better acceptance network to provide an end-to-end solution that works well. On that basis, we're busy right now with our partners in China with the banks with acquirers, issuers and so forth, to discuss rolling out on the issuing side as well as on the acceptance side for six months, as you rightly said. Now for years, we have been very active in China on the cross-border side. And those are strong relationships with the same exact banks. And we're just -- I mentioned too, with ICBC and Bank of Communications, we're just launching new products. So the fact that we are well positioned today with the banks gives us an edge here on moving forward at speed. As I also said, going live within the first six months doesn't mean that we're live everywhere, and we have to build this out over time to get full opportunity in the medium to the long term. And on the conversion piece, just to know, for the U.S., we saw -- I mentioned this earlier for Webster and for Citizens, conversion is starting. Some of the big conversions in Europe have already completed. Sachin talked about the lapping for NatWest and so forth. So Sachin, if there's anything else?\nSachin Mehra: Craig, I would just add, like Michael said, right? I mean as you would imagine, in terms of how we think about 2024 and our thoughts for 2024, we do factor in what our best estimate as it relates to the conversion of the portfolios. What I'd tell you is, we've had a decent amount of wins across the globe. We for the most part, the sizable ones are staggered wins as and they come on over a period of time. They're not episodic flips, which will take place all at one time. So for example, Citizens, Webster, UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, all of these will play out over the course of \u201824 and in some instances, over multiple years. So we factor in our best estimates on those conversions as we kind of put our thoughts together for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Sachin, thank you for sort of cadence for the year with the first quarter. But I was just wondering, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the expectations for payments versus the value-added service revenues? And then specific to that Brazil tax legislation. I guess, is it neutral to EPS? It adds to OpEx, but lower taxes? Just maybe you could help us with that, too.\nSachin Mehra: Let me just take the Brazil one first, and I'll come back to your second question. So on the Brazil piece, it increases our operating expenses because it's an increase in indirect taxes, which are there. That is a -- it's more than offset in our tax rate and in the thoughts, we've given you from a tax rate standpoint. So from an overall EPS standpoint, it actually ends up being slightly accretive because of the more than offset, which is taking place on the tax line there. On your question around payments versus value-added services and solutions expectations. Look, we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to how we see payment network revenue and value-added services and solutions revenue. But at the high level, here's what I'd say. Let me first address the value-added services and solutions piece. We continue to see good growth in our solutions around everything around our fraud and security solutions, our data analytics and insights, and we're building all of those into our thoughts for the year. We've had a good year in 2023. We continue to see a good outlook for value-services and solutions going into 2024. Likewise, for payments, right? I mean as you can imagine, in payments, it's a function of what we think will happen from a carded market volume growth rate standpoint and what the impacts will be from share wins as well as the impacts of rebates and incentives. So all of that kind of is factored in. What I would tell you broadly is that we continue to expect value-added services and solutions to grow at a faster pace than we do on the payment network side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just thinking about the outlook. I think Harshita to ask it as well, just the outlook for growth between the U.S. and rest of world. Any -- anything to call out there? Do you expect the trends observed in '23 to be different in 2024 here between the two regions?\nSachin Mehra: Yes, Tien-Tsin, honestly, I would tell you from a secular opportunity standpoint, right? I mean, we continue to believe, broadly speaking, the secular opportunity is greater outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. There's a good news, bad news story there. And the good news is that, that means we've been quite successful in driving the secular shift opportunity in the U.S., which is what you're seeing in the results come through. And again, from a bad news standpoint is there's a lower remaining opportunity on the volume side in the U.S. But if you ask me the question on a year-over-year basis, I would tell you, I don\u2019t expect any meaningful shift in terms of suddenly the trajectory of how the secular opportunity is being realized between the U.S. and the rest of the world to be changing between \u201823 and \u201824.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.\nDaniel Perlin: I heard you call out a couple of times geopolitical concerns, and I know that there's some, I don't know, 30 or 40 different elections happening around the globe. So my question to you is, as you think about managing those potential concerns, are there certain regions where you feel like there could be pockets of more nationalistic behavior, which would be problematic for you guys getting into those markets? Or that because of election years historically, what you've seen are that it kind of slows down adoption and some of the secular trends that you would have otherwise been able to enjoy in maybe a non-election year? So just trying to handicap what maybe some of those positives and negatives could be just geopolitically this year.\nMichael Miebach: Dan, you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than us monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So those are all things that affect consumer sentiment, potentially affect consumer spending. So we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financial responsibility responsibly is up to date. Certainly, the last three years have had no shortages of such challenges, and we adapted quickly. More specifically to the points that you mentioned, elections happen regularly. So there is nothing dramatically new in 2024. And geopolitical conflicts, they've been around, and they keep going. And that is something we'll watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again, our Economics Institute is keeping a focus on that. So nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days, one has to just take a look left and right all the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: It's good to see the value-add services and solutions accelerate, maybe going back to 17% from 14%. Maybe you could just revisit that for a minute in terms of -- I know you sounded confident that, that should sustain strong growth relative to the business. And so maybe just revisit the drivers of that and what gives you the confidence that sustains? And really just overall, what's the -- what's -- if you sort of rank the top items in that category?\nMichael Miebach: So let me kick off on that. If you split out the value-added services here, you have our other services, which Sachin touched on earlier, for example, our real-time payment assets and things like that. The thing that we have historically focused on here in this space is our cyber and intelligence solutions, fraud solutions, and the data insights and analytics solutions. So if you think about how that flywheel talks about, I talked about the powerful cycle earlier on. So more payments that need to be kept safe, more payments throughout more data, which drive more data analytics inside. That is the underlying kind of secular trend, which is pretty closely related to the secular shift as well. So that is the baseline of growth here. And then you look at some of the more specific growth drivers here. For example, in data analytics, in that group, we also have our personalization solution. So everybody is trying to engage their consumers at this point. That is on the banking side. It's on the merchant side and here coming in with a solution that provides the right offer through the right channel at the right time to drive through that clutter. We have the number 1 personalization company that we acquired two years ago. That is one of the drivers we expect some big growth there. You look at the other hand on the cyber and security solutions, digital identity. An authentication solution today, nobody likes passwords, you're in a situation where you have to end up making trade-offs between simplicity and security when it comes to digital payments and with our technology, we find ways to go around that effectively, driving down fraud. At the same time, ensure that there's low abandonment rates. So biometric solutions, I talked about them earlier, is one of those examples. So across these two portfolios, C&I and DNS, cyber analytics and data insights, that\u2019s where we see the big growth and the big demand. Other solutions, real-time payments, we have a strong position there. We talked about this a couple of quarters ago, where we said we are in the markets in which we are, and we\u2019re driving the scale volumes and the reference to our strategic partnership with TCH to show that we continue on that front. So those are kind of the key drivers that we see here. We feel this is a uniquely differentiated portfolio, and that\u2019s in great demand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair.\nCris Kennedy: And you just talked about it. But can you give a broader update on your digital identity solutions and what your strategy is for that and how it can ultimately impact your business?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So let me do that. I just gave you the headlines on that. So specifically, within that, there's a whole set of solutions from biometric to identity events where we have an ability to provide an identity confidence score to one of our customers and saying, this person has lived at the address before and here is their previous employment. So with this -- with a certain level of confidence, we can say, this is the person. All this stuff is kind of happening behind the scenes. That is the approach that we're taking. But it's not just our identity data. We are combining this with open banking. We're trying to find use cases where this really makes a difference. For example, an account opening. So we're taking our open banking technology in our Finicity footprint here in the United States, all the way up to 90% of our deposit accounts in this market. And we're taking our digital identity solution into a premium account owner verification and account opening solution. Those are the kind of examples where we see we\u2019re truly differentiated. At the highest level, it\u2019s before and after the transaction, we\u2019re driving value through digital identity. We feel this is absolutely central to the digital economy. And that\u2019s why we put it in the new network because there are people who have identity data and there are people who want to use identity data. We don\u2019t want to hold it. We\u2019re sitting somewhere in the middle, and we are essentially the trusted partner that can prove one way or another if a person is the person they claim to be. Minimal use of data, permission data.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital.\nPaul Golding: I guess to touch on Finicity since you just mentioned it, Michael. Do you see this evolving more so as a value-added service and solution driver or a volume driver now that you've had it in the portfolio for some time? And then as a follow-on, I just wanted to see if we could get some more color on the acceptance location growth from a regional perspective, given the strength in international volumes in the period?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So starting with Finicity and then we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IR acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the three regions where we're focused. And open banking does a number of things. Essentially, what we see is a set of use cases here that, that rise to the top and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about Open Data, where people can use their data footprint. Small businesses can use the data footprint for getting access to better services. But for now, what's really rising at the top is account opening, the example that I already gave. Open Banking for payments, I come to that for a moment -- in a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. So those are kind of the three categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments, it's really interesting, to your point. Is this a volume driver? It could be. Because the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases as we have the pay by bank solution in the United States in partnership with JS Bank. So we hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea. And that builds on our experience with pay by bank in the U.K. This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S., where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiators. So use cases that matter. That\u2019s the focus. And out of that, we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through. That was a second part of the question. My team is just reminding me. Acceptance growth regionally. I mean it comes to the answer actually that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth and the regional comparison. So when you think beyond the United States, we see a tremendous growth opportunity. Here in the United States, you would say it\u2019s more new use cases and verticals, and it\u2019s more generally and broader acceptance across the payments landscape in the rest of the world. There\u2019s even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example. So it\u2019s a country that is what the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan. So tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on, where we\u2019re investing heavily in acceptance footprint. So I would say it\u2019s leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we\u2019re very busy going for use cases and verticals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore.\nDavid Togut: Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. Could you share your insights into your runway for growth in some of your largest countries, for example, Germany and Italy. And maybe frame that in terms of payment volume growth and vast growth opportunity.\nMichael Miebach: Let me start off with that question. First of all, I do want to underline what you just said. It is a source of differentiated growth for us. We've had a great run in Europe. And it's a combination of share growth, but it's also driven by the ways that we find to go after the accelerated secular shift that we saw on the back end of COVID. Countries like Germany really driving up contactless usage, just to give you one example. So overall, Europe has been firing on all cylinders for us. And I come back to the growth algorithm that we laid out for payments, which applies very much in Europe. So European economies will do what they do, but we will continue to focus on share gain, but we will also be very busy to take the share gains that we've already had and turn that into profitable volume for us. Conversions driving that. We had a question on that earlier. So that's driver number one. And then going into new flows in Europe, there is opportunity there as well. If you look at alternative payment systems, everything that's going on in Europe, clearly, through PSD3 and so forth, there's a lot of movement in Europe that we will stay on top as we look ahead into that. Differentiated assets in bill pay in the Nordics and so forth. So we have a pretty broad footprint to participate in all the drivers in Europe. In terms of Services, the services has been strong in Europe for a long time. Our advisers on our consulting business has been a winner for us in Europe for the longest time. And if you look at some of these big wins, that we've talked about, they all have a significant contribution of services. In fact, I would say, oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals. So nothing dramatically different there. I think Europe has caught up on secular trend in digitization and we're firing on all cylinders. We have -- we're fully invested in Europe. As you know, one of the big topics in Europe is European sovereignty, and we are deeply invested in Europe with our efforts, and we're engaging with -- in Brussels in the nation states and so forth, which is very important for us to do to be a partner on their journey.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. David, it's Sachin. I'll just emphasize what Michael just said, right? He has mentioned on a couple of occasions today that payments drives value-add service and solutions and value-added service and solutions drive payments. It's no different in Europe, right? For all the share wins we've had in Europe, for all the growth we're seeing on the payment side, it creates new opportunities for us on the services side. And then vice versa, as you actually do deliver on those services, you get the benefit of additional data. When you get the benefit of additional data, you are able to help optimize existing portfolios, which again drives payment volume growth. And that's not unique to Europe. It's actually true for the way we run the business globally. But the fact that we are actually increasingly becoming more prominent in the payment flow enables that cycle to work quite effectively.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.\nKen Suchoski: I just wanted to ask about the yields on the domestic assessment revenue line. That yield has declined year-over-year for some time now, and they came in a little bit lighter than some were expecting this quarter. I think you highlighted mix impacting the yields or the spread between revenue and volume growth. So could you just provide some more detail around the specific changes that you're seeing in terms of mix? And could we get to a place where domestic yields are actually expanding year-over-year?\nSachin Mehra: Look, I mean, I'll comment on the yield piece, because what you're seeing effectively in the fourth quarter of 2023, when you look at payment network net revenue divided by GDV is what you see every year in terms of the sequential decline in yields. And that's primarily being driven by the fact that, remember, in the third quarter of all years, we tend to have our strongest cross-border performance. And our cross-border tends to come with our best yields. And so what you've got is when you're getting more bang for the buck for $1 of GDV on the cross-border side than you are on the domestic volume side. So that's what's causing for that sequential decline. You'll see that as a pattern, which has existed in prior years as well. Broadly speaking, I would tell you that, otherwise, there's nothing unusual to call out on the payment network net revenue yield. The one reminder I'll give you is that, we run the business not only to optimize payment network, net revenue yield, but overall net revenue yield for our company. Because again, it goes back to the question David asked right before you, Ken, which is at the end of the day, we've got to be in the payment flow. We've got to allow ourselves to have the opportunity to deliver services on those payments to generate additional revenue, which causes for overall net accretion in our overall net revenue yield. So I know your question is specific to payment network net revenue, but I just wanted to make sure you know that from our mindset standpoint, we're looking at payment network net revenue yield as well as overall net revenue growth to the company.\nMichael Miebach: I should say, earlier when I was talking about the payment algorithm, I said that we are putting great focus on our financial discipline. And we do it with revenues in mind and with services revenue in mind. So yes, it needs to add up to the overall net revenue yield, as Sachin just said. But I\u2019m telling you, we don\u2019t want to win every deal. We want to win the deals we want to win, and we\u2019re pretty disciplined about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I wanted to dig in, Michael, if I'm at a little bit more on your pay by bank initiatives. Can this be, especially as we see the emergence of networks like tax in Brazil, for example, can this be sort of a stand-alone growth driver in its own right? Or is it sort of folded into your overall comments on open banking? I just wanted to see if there's an important distinction to draw as we think about go-forward growth opportunities.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So I think both questions, your question and the previous question hit on an important point there. There is a particular point of interest for us at the intersection of open banking and payments. It enables -- the open banking connectivity enables us to go after use cases that we otherwise wouldn't be able to go after. So here's additional data that is available that you can then combine in combination with an underlying RTP rail to make a profitable proposition for a customer, which is exactly what Chase Pay-by-Bank is. Basically, you debit your customer when there's a balance, and that is what the open banking connectivity tells you. So that's a good solution. If we look broadly around the world, Pix, UPI in India, FedNow, there's a bunch of real-time payment systems. And those are the kind of rails where we have experience. We have connectivity. In some, we operate them ourselves. So that is exactly what we're looking at as one of the assets and the propositions that we will bring together for our customers. Now, more broadly speaking, when you look at Pix, when you look at UPI, one other thing to keep in mind is, here\u2019s public sector doing a good job in pulling in more participants in the overall digital economy so we can come in with our solutions, our real-time payment solutions, our card-based solutions, but they\u2019re basically extending the digital economy to create a tide that kind of lifts everybody\u2019s boats, financial inclusion being the headline. So that\u2019s something to consider. Somewhere in between, there are points that we will manage very carefully as in when these systems grow and they provide alternatives to our solutions that we compete and provide the best solution to consumers and to our customers. On the fraud side, on ease of use, a lot of these systems don\u2019t have all of these functionalities. So those are things that we focus on. So we\u2019re focused on providing the best choice to our customers. We don\u2019t mind the competition, but we actually see quite a bit of opportunity for us to use these rails for the open banking type of solution that you just asked about. So interesting space, and it drives the overall economic growth, digital economic growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies.\nTrevor Williams: Sachin, I was just hoping you could put a finer point on the growth algorithm within the full year revenue outlook. I know you mentioned some of the cadence dynamics with VAS and currency vault, but any help on what you're assuming for volume and transaction growth relative to the January trends, rebates and incentives, pricing? Any help on those would be great.\nSachin Mehra: So look, I'm not going to give you a specific kind of forecast as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics from an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint. I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. And we kind of have new things which we're launching, there's new value we're delivering to our customers. And as we do that, we'll continue to price for that. On specifically the Contra question. I think -- the important thing to note on Contra is that, at the end of the day, Contra is enabling volume growth, right? We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. And as we do that, we're paying for that. For the first quarter, we expect our Contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 of 2023. I would tell you, on a full year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition. Some of that will not. There'll be other things, which will move in and out. And so I'm not going to kind of share with you what the full year outlook is on Contra. But for Q1, I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are, we expect that Contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 of 2023.\nMichael Miebach: We have time for just one more, Brianna.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: I appreciate all the comments so far. My question is on real-time payments. And Michael, you did have some incremental comments there on TCH, but saw the TCH renewal. Obviously, you have a global set of capabilities here. My question is, what's the runway and what drives it? Is it the use cases rather than more countries? And then if it is use cases, what are some of the use cases that you see coming up that are exciting from a conversion perspective?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So first of all, the strategic relationship here in the U.S. with the Clearinghouse is important to note. Back when in 2016, '17, real-time payments really took off. This is when we invested in VocaLink and VocaLink was a partner with the Clearinghouse at the time. So a strong and more strategic renewal here is a big statement, and it speaks to our position in real-time payments. 10 out of the top 50 GDP countries, we either operate, are providing software and services to the real-time payment system. So it's real. It's there as the name indicates, and it's carrying a lot of volume for us in itself. That's an interesting business. But it's much more than that. It's much more than that as we're talking to various players, including ones that I mentioned about new applications that come on top of that. Coming right back to the Chase Pay-by-Bank example, here is access to rails on one hand and then a set of additional data that turns a simple payment that gets money from A to B to something that's a value-add payment. That is where we're going to go. And these use cases will play out in a somewhat different way. It is obviously always our interest to find global solutions, but it's also -- this is a rather more geographic specifically driven space. So we'll have to see where that all lands. So we keep that in mind, which is why we're not driving into many more markets right now. We're the most critical markets and here we're staying very close to where that is going. But it's applications and it's scaling volumes in the markets that we're in, it's where the focus is.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Michael. Any last comments?\nMichael Miebach: Well, as always, thank you for your support to Mastercard. Thank you for listening to Sachin and me, and thank you to everybody at Mastercard for making all this work. We'll speak to you in one quarter. It's also unusual to note this is on a Wednesday today. I don't think we ever had that before. Certainly, for me, this is the first Wednesday. We'll see how we mix it up next time. Speak to you in a quarter. Thank you, and bye-bye.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a non-recurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the UK. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup. Turning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first four weeks of January. Starting with switch volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all Mastercard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps. Moving to the first four weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impacts from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year-over-year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio. Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first four weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to show strength. Turning now to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events, and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As it relates to the full-year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year. Now turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter. Let me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by two factors: First, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year. And second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace, from a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Sure, Harshita. Let me take those questions. First, on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint, we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far on the data. Obviously, we will keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact. On your question around U.S. card volume growth. Look, at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S., there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity, both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume and a transaction standpoint. But more specifically, what I'd tell you is the following, which is in the release of the U.S. We've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place, i.e., is it taking place in carded volumes? Or is it taking place in non-carded categories of spend? So as you do the analysis, at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is, we look at PCE, we think about, on a normalized basis, if inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity, which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint. Now in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S. continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active. We're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers. We've had good wins on the debit space, which, as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S. So overall, I tell you from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth, driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift as well as share. And again, what I'm talking about is, on the card payment volume side of the business. Craig, I would just add, like Michael said, right? I mean as you would imagine, in terms of how we think about 2024 and our thoughts for 2024, we do factor in what our best estimate as it relates to the conversion of the portfolios. What I'd tell you is, we've had a decent amount of wins across the globe. We for the most part, the sizable ones are staggered wins as and they come on over a period of time. They're not episodic flips, which will take place all at one time. So for example, Citizens, Webster, UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, all of these will play out over the course of \u201824 and in some instances, over multiple years. So we factor in our best estimates on those conversions as we kind of put our thoughts together for the year. Let me just take the Brazil one first, and I'll come back to your second question. So on the Brazil piece, it increases our operating expenses because it's an increase in indirect taxes, which are there. That is a -- it's more than offset in our tax rate and in the thoughts, we've given you from a tax rate standpoint. So from an overall EPS standpoint, it actually ends up being slightly accretive because of the more than offset, which is taking place on the tax line there. On your question around payments versus value-added services and solutions expectations. Look, we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to how we see payment network revenue and value-added services and solutions revenue. But at the high level, here's what I'd say. Let me first address the value-added services and solutions piece. We continue to see good growth in our solutions around everything around our fraud and security solutions, our data analytics and insights, and we're building all of those into our thoughts for the year. We've had a good year in 2023. We continue to see a good outlook for value-services and solutions going into 2024. Likewise, for payments, right? I mean as you can imagine, in payments, it's a function of what we think will happen from a carded market volume growth rate standpoint and what the impacts will be from share wins as well as the impacts of rebates and incentives. So all of that kind of is factored in. What I would tell you broadly is that we continue to expect value-added services and solutions to grow at a faster pace than we do on the payment network side. Yes, Tien-Tsin, honestly, I would tell you from a secular opportunity standpoint, right? I mean, we continue to believe, broadly speaking, the secular opportunity is greater outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. There's a good news, bad news story there. And the good news is that, that means we've been quite successful in driving the secular shift opportunity in the U.S., which is what you're seeing in the results come through. And again, from a bad news standpoint is there's a lower remaining opportunity on the volume side in the U.S. But if you ask me the question on a year-over-year basis, I would tell you, I don't expect any meaningful shift in terms of suddenly the trajectory of how the secular opportunity is being realized between the U.S. and the rest of the world to be changing between \u201823 and \u201824. Yes. David, it's Sachin. I'll just emphasize what Michael just said, right? He has mentioned on a couple of occasions today that payments drives value-add service and solutions and value-added service and solutions drive payments. It's no different in Europe, right? For all the share wins we've had in Europe, for all the growth we're seeing on the payment side, it creates new opportunities for us on the services side. And then vice versa, as you actually do deliver on those services, you get the benefit of additional data. When you get the benefit of additional data, you are able to help optimize existing portfolios, which again drives payment volume growth. And that's not unique to Europe. It's actually true for the way we run the business globally. But the fact that we are actually increasingly becoming more prominent in the payment flow enables that cycle to work quite effectively. Look, I mean, I'll comment on the yield piece, because what you're seeing effectively in the fourth quarter of 2023, when you look at payment network net revenue divided by GDV is what you see every year in terms of the sequential decline in yields. And that's primarily being driven by the fact that, remember, in the third quarter of all years, we tend to have our strongest cross-border performance. And our cross-border tends to come with our best yields. And so what you've got is when you're getting more bang for the buck for $1 of GDV on the cross-border side than you are on the domestic volume side. So that's what's causing for that sequential decline. You'll see that as a pattern, which has existed in prior years as well. Broadly speaking, I would tell you that, otherwise, there's nothing unusual to call out on the payment network net revenue yield. The one reminder I'll give you is that, we run the business not only to optimize payment network, net revenue yield, but overall net revenue yield for our company. Because again, it goes back to the question David asked right before you, Ken, which is at the end of the day, we've got to be in the payment flow. We've got to allow ourselves to have the opportunity to deliver services on those payments to generate additional revenue, which causes for overall net accretion in our overall net revenue yield. So I know your question is specific to payment network net revenue, but I just wanted to make sure you know that from our mindset standpoint, we're looking at payment network net revenue yield as well as overall net revenue growth to the company. So look, I'm not going to give you a specific kind of forecast as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics from an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint. I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. And we kind of have new things which we're launching, there's new value we're delivering to our customers. And as we do that, we'll continue to price for that. On specifically the Contra question. I think -- the important thing to note on Contra is that, at the end of the day, Contra is enabling volume growth, right? We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. And as we do that, we're paying for that. For the first quarter, we expect our Contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 of 2023. I would tell you, on a full year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition. Some of that will not. There'll be other things, which will move in and out. And so I'm not going to kind of share with you what the full year outlook is on Contra. But for Q1, I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are, we expect that Contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 of 2023. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter four net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique diversified products and services both designed to solve our customers' needs. Let's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we're monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely and we'll manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy and cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities which fuel our growth algorithm across payments and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of five key areas. One, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies. Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions. Three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flow. And four, growing market share, and five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest. Building on that, the runway for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We're now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app, and larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store. We're supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023 expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the UK, France, Brazil and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed-loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, which creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories. We've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems. However, there's still significant runway for us given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure and password-free checkout solutions and with that bring an elevated level of security, simplicity and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser, or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness. For Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving tokenization across all channels including devices, commerce platforms, card on file and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave. After launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia-Pacific region. We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account to account and new flows. This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. Debit portfolio to Mastercard, making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy, will migrate their debit card portfolio to Mastercard as well. We renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia where we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios. We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expands into new services including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial, consumer credit and prepaid portfolios. We're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, Mastercard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment and neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. This quarter, Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the UK renewed their partnership with Mastercard. In the co-brand space, we're partnering with J. Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States. As you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services, while always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and in turn further drive services growth. Looking to China, we are thrilled that our joint venture in China has released formal approval to commence domestic bankcard clearing. Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first world Mastercard product in November and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card. Beyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with The Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real time payments in the United States. Now shifting gears, we continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR, two of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium and on the virtual card front, we announced two exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda. Turning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. Payments, services and new networks reinforce each other. We said it countless times. Our services and new networks provide differentiation as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too and payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transactions, more need for fraud tools and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types and continuing to build and deploy new services. Here are a few examples how we are executing against each of these. The past year Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This is on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio lifecycle management. Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly to their bank app. Now with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file. Square is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chose Mastercard as a strategic partner to rollout open banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud. And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with Generative AI. Generative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, and makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We're working on many GenAI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced Shopping Muse. Shopping Muse uses Generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers' colloquial language into tailored recommendations. Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year, will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone. And finally, we expanded Mastercard Access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI digital and identity services. Using access customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks including those outside the Mastercard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities. So with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you. Right. Let me take the China question first and we come back to the conversion topic that you raised. So needless to say, we're thrilled about China. So this is a -- it's a massive economy, and we feel we're well positioned to serve it. As I said in my remarks at the beginning, we feel we're uniquely positioned to put into the hand of Chinese consumers a solution -- a seamless solution that works domestically as well as when they travel. That's not unique. There's another competitor that has that kind of a proposition. But we do have the much better acceptance network to provide an end-to-end solution that works well. On that basis, we're busy right now with our partners in China with the banks with acquirers, issuers and so forth, to discuss rolling out on the issuing side as well as on the acceptance side for six months, as you rightly said. Now for years, we have been very active in China on the cross-border side. And those are strong relationships with the same exact banks. And we're just -- I mentioned too, with ICBC and Bank of Communications, we're just launching new products. So the fact that we are well positioned today with the banks gives us an edge here on moving forward at speed. As I also said, going live within the first six months doesn't mean that we're live everywhere, and we have to build this out over time to get full opportunity in the medium to the long term. And on the conversion piece, just to know, for the U.S., we saw -- I mentioned this earlier for Webster and for Citizens, conversion is starting. Some of the big conversions in Europe have already completed. Sachin talked about the lapping for NatWest and so forth. So Sachin, if there's anything else? Dan, you just touched on some of the key things to watch out for. But this is no different than us monitoring fiscal monetary policy reactions by central banks and governments. So those are all things that affect consumer sentiment, potentially affect consumer spending. So we'll just have to stay close to what that is. Our discipline around these things is to do some solid scenario planning and making sure our playbook in terms of managing our financial responsibility responsibly is up to date. Certainly, the last three years have had no shortages of such challenges, and we adapted quickly. More specifically to the points that you mentioned, elections happen regularly. So there is nothing dramatically new in 2024. And geopolitical conflicts, they've been around, and they keep going. And that is something we'll watch what is the impact on energy prices and various downstream into the broader economy. Yet again, our Economics Institute is keeping a focus on that. So nothing very specific. That's why we kept it relatively high level. But these days, one has to just take a look left and right all the time. So let me kick off on that. If you split out the value-added services here, you have our other services, which Sachin touched on earlier, for example, our real-time payment assets and things like that. The thing that we have historically focused on here in this space is our cyber and intelligence solutions, fraud solutions, and the data insights and analytics solutions. So if you think about how that flywheel talks about, I talked about the powerful cycle earlier on. So more payments that need to be kept safe, more payments throughout more data, which drive more data analytics inside. That is the underlying kind of secular trend, which is pretty closely related to the secular shift as well. So that is the baseline of growth here. And then you look at some of the more specific growth drivers here. For example, in data analytics, in that group, we also have our personalization solution. So everybody is trying to engage their consumers at this point. That is on the banking side. It's on the merchant side and here coming in with a solution that provides the right offer through the right channel at the right time to drive through that clutter. We have the number 1 personalization company that we acquired two years ago. That is one of the drivers we expect some big growth there. You look at the other hand on the cyber and security solutions, digital identity. An authentication solution today, nobody likes passwords, you're in a situation where you have to end up making trade-offs between simplicity and security when it comes to digital payments and with our technology, we find ways to go around that effectively, driving down fraud. At the same time, ensure that there's low abandonment rates. So biometric solutions, I talked about them earlier, is one of those examples. So across these two portfolios, C&I and DNS, cyber analytics and data insights, that's where we see the big growth and the big demand. Other solutions, real-time payments, we have a strong position there. We talked about this a couple of quarters ago, where we said we are in the markets in which we are, and we're driving the scale volumes and the reference to our strategic partnership with TCH to show that we continue on that front. So those are kind of the key drivers that we see here. We feel this is a uniquely differentiated portfolio, and that's in great demand. Right. So let me do that. I just gave you the headlines on that. So specifically, within that, there's a whole set of solutions from biometric to identity events where we have an ability to provide an identity confidence score to one of our customers and saying, this person has lived at the address before and here is their previous employment. So with this -- with a certain level of confidence, we can say, this is the person. All this stuff is kind of happening behind the scenes. That is the approach that we're taking. But it's not just our identity data. We are combining this with open banking. We're trying to find use cases where this really makes a difference. For example, an account opening. So we're taking our open banking technology in our Finicity footprint here in the United States, all the way up to 90% of our deposit accounts in this market. And we're taking our digital identity solution into a premium account owner verification and account opening solution. Those are the kind of examples where we see we're truly differentiated. At the highest level, it's before and after the transaction, we're driving value through digital identity. We feel this is absolutely central to the digital economy. And that's why we put it in the new network because there are people who have identity data and there are people who want to use identity data. We don't want to hold it. We're sitting somewhere in the middle, and we are essentially the trusted partner that can prove one way or another if a person is the person they claim to be. Minimal use of data, permission data. Right. So starting with Finicity and then we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IR acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the three regions where we're focused. And open banking does a number of things. Essentially, what we see is a set of use cases here that, that rise to the top and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about Open Data, where people can use their data footprint. Small businesses can use the data footprint for getting access to better services. But for now, what's really rising at the top is account opening, the example that I already gave. Open Banking for payments, I come to that for a moment -- in a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. So those are kind of the three categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments, it's really interesting, to your point. Is this a volume driver? It could be. Because the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases as we have the pay by bank solution in the United States in partnership with JS Bank. So we hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea. And that builds on our experience with pay by bank in the U.K. This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S., where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiators. So use cases that matter. That's the focus. And out of that, we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through. That was a second part of the question. My team is just reminding me. Acceptance growth regionally. I mean it comes to the answer actually that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth and the regional comparison. So when you think beyond the United States, we see a tremendous growth opportunity. Here in the United States, you would say it's more new use cases and verticals, and it's more generally and broader acceptance across the payments landscape in the rest of the world. There's even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example. So it's a country that is what the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan. So tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on, where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint. So I would say it's leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals. Let me start off with that question. First of all, I do want to underline what you just said. It is a source of differentiated growth for us. We've had a great run in Europe. And it's a combination of share growth, but it's also driven by the ways that we find to go after the accelerated secular shift that we saw on the back end of COVID. Countries like Germany really driving up contactless usage, just to give you one example. So overall, Europe has been firing on all cylinders for us. And I come back to the growth algorithm that we laid out for payments, which applies very much in Europe. So European economies will do what they do, but we will continue to focus on share gain, but we will also be very busy to take the share gains that we've already had and turn that into profitable volume for us. Conversions driving that. We had a question on that earlier. So that's driver number one. And then going into new flows in Europe, there is opportunity there as well. If you look at alternative payment systems, everything that's going on in Europe, clearly, through PSD3 and so forth, there's a lot of movement in Europe that we will stay on top as we look ahead into that. Differentiated assets in bill pay in the Nordics and so forth. So we have a pretty broad footprint to participate in all the drivers in Europe. In terms of Services, the services has been strong in Europe for a long time. Our advisers on our consulting business has been a winner for us in Europe for the longest time. And if you look at some of these big wins, that we've talked about, they all have a significant contribution of services. In fact, I would say, oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals. So nothing dramatically different there. I think Europe has caught up on secular trend in digitization and we're firing on all cylinders. We have -- we're fully invested in Europe. As you know, one of the big topics in Europe is European sovereignty, and we are deeply invested in Europe with our efforts, and we're engaging with -- in Brussels in the nation states and so forth, which is very important for us to do to be a partner on their journey. I should say, earlier when I was talking about the payment algorithm, I said that we are putting great focus on our financial discipline. And we do it with revenues in mind and with services revenue in mind. So yes, it needs to add up to the overall net revenue yield, as Sachin just said. But I'm telling you, we don't want to win every deal. We want to win the deals we want to win, and we're pretty disciplined about it. Right. So I think both questions, your question and the previous question hit on an important point there. There is a particular point of interest for us at the intersection of open banking and payments. It enables -- the open banking connectivity enables us to go after use cases that we otherwise wouldn't be able to go after. So here's additional data that is available that you can then combine in combination with an underlying RTP rail to make a profitable proposition for a customer, which is exactly what Chase Pay-by-Bank is. Basically, you debit your customer when there's a balance, and that is what the open banking connectivity tells you. So that's a good solution. If we look broadly around the world, Pix, UPI in India, FedNow, there's a bunch of real-time payment systems. And those are the kind of rails where we have experience. We have connectivity. In some, we operate them ourselves. So that is exactly what we're looking at as one of the assets and the propositions that we will bring together for our customers. Now, more broadly speaking, when you look at Pix, when you look at UPI, one other thing to keep in mind is, here's public sector doing a good job in pulling in more participants in the overall digital economy so we can come in with our solutions, our real-time payment solutions, our card-based solutions, but they're basically extending the digital economy to create a tide that kind of lifts everybody's boats, financial inclusion being the headline. So that's something to consider. Somewhere in between, there are points that we will manage very carefully as in when these systems grow and they provide alternatives to our solutions that we compete and provide the best solution to consumers and to our customers. On the fraud side, on ease of use, a lot of these systems don't have all of these functionalities. So those are things that we focus on. So we're focused on providing the best choice to our customers. We don't mind the competition, but we actually see quite a bit of opportunity for us to use these rails for the open banking type of solution that you just asked about. So interesting space, and it drives the overall economic growth, digital economic growth. We have time for just one more, Brianna. Right. So first of all, the strategic relationship here in the U.S. with the Clearinghouse is important to note. Back when in 2016, '17, real-time payments really took off. This is when we invested in VocaLink and VocaLink was a partner with the Clearinghouse at the time. So a strong and more strategic renewal here is a big statement, and it speaks to our position in real-time payments. 10 out of the top 50 GDP countries, we either operate, are providing software and services to the real-time payment system. So it's real. It's there as the name indicates, and it's carrying a lot of volume for us in itself. That's an interesting business. But it's much more than that. It's much more than that as we're talking to various players, including ones that I mentioned about new applications that come on top of that. Coming right back to the Chase Pay-by-Bank example, here is access to rails on one hand and then a set of additional data that turns a simple payment that gets money from A to B to something that's a value-add payment. That is where we're going to go. And these use cases will play out in a somewhat different way. It is obviously always our interest to find global solutions, but it's also -- this is a rather more geographic specifically driven space. So we'll have to see where that all lands. So we keep that in mind, which is why we're not driving into many more markets right now. We're the most critical markets and here we're staying very close to where that is going. But it's applications and it's scaling volumes in the markets that we're in, it's where the focus is. Well, as always, thank you for your support to Mastercard. Thank you for listening to Sachin and me, and thank you to everybody at Mastercard for making all this work. We'll speak to you in one quarter. It's also unusual to note this is on a Wednesday today. I don't think we ever had that before. Certainly, for me, this is the first Wednesday. We'll see how we mix it up next time. Speak to you in a quarter. Thank you, and bye-bye."

Q2 2023 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Mr. Devin Corr, head of investor relations, you may begin your conference.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third-quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our chief executive officer; and Sachin Mehra, our chief financial officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then, that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Michael Miebach. \nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning from New York, everyone. Let me start by acknowledging the recent terror attacks in Israel and the resulting war with Hamas and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We're deeply saddened by the suffering and the loss. Our focus is on the well-being of our people, those who have been directly impacted, and those in our teams around the world, who are dealing with this terrible situation. We will continue to give them support while contributing to relieve efforts. We will monitor the situation closely so we can take action as required. Turning to our results, our quarter three results demonstrate the strong fundamentals of our business, our diversified model, and the continued resilience in consumer spending. Quarter three net revenues were up 11% and operating income was up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP, currency-neutral basis, excluding special items. On a macroeconomic front, there are a few factors we focus on. First, the labor market remains strong, which is a key driver of consumer spending. However, we continue to monitor aspects such as credit availability and savings behaviors. Second, although inflation levels have moderated, they remain elevated. As central banks continue to actively manage monetary policy, we expect the impacts to vary across countries and sectors. Also, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern, further underscored by the recent events in the Middle East. We are monitoring these moving pieces and stand ready to manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy, with some moderation in spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel remains strong at 155% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. And cross-border card present X-travel continues to hold up well at 209% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. And this is cross-border card not present X-travel. So overall, consumer spending remains resilient and we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities. We see substantial runway for growth through the long-term potential in person-to-merchant payments, the sizable opportunity to address new payment flows, our diverse suite of fast-growing service capabilities, and our investments in areas of future growth like open banking and digital identity. Let's explore these in more detail. Starting with person-to-merchant payments, where we see a sizable long-term growth opportunity. We're winning deals with a diverse set of partners and investing in technology to further drive the shift to electronic forms of payment and capture new ways to pay. The third quarter, our deal momentum across the globe continued. In the US, we're happy to announce that Webster Bank, a leading commercial bank in the Northeast, has chosen MasterCard as their exclusive payment network. They selected us because of our marketing assets, safety and security tools, and commitment to small business. This builds up on recent wins in the U.S. like the Citizens Debit Portfolio Flip with the transition on track for 2024. These two wins are clear examples of the value we deliver through our partnerships and the reasons banks are willing to move their debit business to MasterCard. Further, we have partnered with Citi's wealth business to launch their ultra-high net worth credit proposition, targeting their private bank clients in Singapore and Hong Kong. And in East Africa, we signed a long-term deal with Equity Bank Group that significantly increases our share across the six markets where they have presence. On the co-brand front, we joined Barclays to launch Xbox, first credit card in the United States. Building off our long-standing relationship with Microsoft, this product is an example of how we're tapping into the fast-growing gaming space. And of course, we continue to strengthen our travel-focused programs, renewing our Frontier Airlines program issued by Barclays, as well as the Turkish Airlines program with Garanti BBVA. Winning deals positions us well to capture PCE and secular growth. There's a sizable opportunity across volumes and transactions, and we benefit from both. We're bringing together innovation, technology, the experience, and trust that consumers want and expect in their daily lives. And that starts with our best-in-class digital solutions such as Contactless and tokenization. Contactless now represents 63% of our in-person switch purchase transactions, and the convenience and security of our capabilities are helping us to further penetrate verticals like transit. By converting transit to Open-Loop, we gain access to more low-ticket, high-frequency transactions, both at the station and the surrounding merchants. The last quarter alone, we launched Open-Loop programs with two of the largest transit systems in North America, Toronto, and Philadelphia. We're now live with over 25 agencies in the U.S. and Canada. This year in the Netherlands, we supported the launch of a nationwide Contactless transit payment system. And in Pakistan, we're helping to digitize daily commutes in Karachi with issuance over one million prepaid Open-Loop cards. On tokenization, it has been 10 years since we first introduced the token standard to the industry. Today, it is foundational to the network and it's performing exceptionally well. The number of tokenized transactions has more than doubled over the past two years. We just processed over three billion tokenized transactions in one month. And this functionality is extending to new places to pay. For example, Mercedes-Benz customers in Germany can now pay for fuel directly from their vehicle using only their fingerprint. And Hyundai Motor America is enabling in-vehicle payments for parking with additional features and EV use cases to be enabled in the future. Digital solutions are also key to migrating Maestro to Debit Mastercard. This conversion drives a better cardholder experience, including in many cases, the ability to shop online and across borders, which leads to incremental card spend. And prior to full transition, we offer a virtual companion card to the current Maestro cards for immediate online use. In Europe, we're in the process of sun-setting new issuance of Maestro, and we will continue to work with our issuers on the migration of well over 100 million cards over time. A lot happening in P2M for sure. Onto the second vector for growth, new payment flows. There are substantial untapped flows across commercial payments and the disbursements and remittance space. In commercial, we continue to see strong growth. We're expanding our market-leading virtual card capabilities into new use cases. In the U.S. and Canada, our mobile payment solution is now live with BMO and TechPartner Extend, bringing our virtual card capabilities to contactless business payments. We also continue to expand our reach to corporates by partnering with Oracle to embed MasterCard virtual card capabilities into their Fusion Cloud ERP to enable supplier invoice payments and corporate purchases. And we are integrating our commercial payment and open banking capabilities into SAP Firenir platforms to deliver an embedded payment and lending experience. There remains a significant opportunity to convert cash and check to commercial card products. We're signing deals across the globe to do just that. We're excited to announce that we have agreed a long-term deal with Citibank to forge a global commercial card partnership covering more than 60 markets. The deal extends our leadership position with Citibank and reinforces our efforts to modernize and grow B2B payment flows. We also signed our first ever commercial contract with Axis Bank in India and a commercial deal with the biggest investment bank in Latin America, BTG Pactual. Now, let's focus on disbursements and remittances. With access to more than 95% of the world's bank population, our reach spans more than 180 countries and more than 150 currencies. And we are seeing strong growth. In the third quarter, transactions were up more than 30% on a year-over-year basis. To continue growing in this space, we're expanding into new use cases and geographies. A great example is our partnership with Remitly, one of the fastest growing digital remittance platforms with over five million active users. Remitly will leverage our disbursement and remittance solutions to help make international payments faster, easier, and more secure. We're also expanding our collaboration with Paysend in the U.K. to enhance cross-border payments for SMEs. Now our value-add services and solutions are another important driver for our growth. Collectively, this suite of capabilities is fast-growing and provides a diversified revenue stream. We have invested thoughtfully to develop services focused on supporting our customers in areas of growing need. Cybersecurity threats are rising, a trend that will unfortunately persist. And there's an increasing demand for actionable insights and more personalized experiences. Our services, bolstered by our data-driven intelligence, can help customers reduce fraud, grow their portfolios, and better engage with their end customers. Take our cyber solutions, which protect consumers and the payments ecosystem more broadly. One example is SafetyNet, which in the past 12 months has prevented more than $20 billion in fraud. This is just one of our many fraud solutions that we're deploying to deliver more value and support continued growth. AI also continues to play a critical role powering our products and fueling our network intelligence. We're scaling our AI-powered transaction fraud monitoring solution, which delivers real-time predictive scores based on a unique blend of customer and network-level insights. This powerful solution gives our customers the ability to take preventive action before the transaction is authorized. This quarter alone, we signed agreements in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria with financial institutions and Fintech's, who will benefit from early fraud detection and with merchants who will experience less friction and higher approval rates. In the end, this all makes for a better consumer experience. We're also using our services, combining our data and expertise to help clients optimize and do more with their portfolios. This drives both direct services revenue and incremental payments revenue. Our consulting, marketing services, and targeting analytics help clients design and execute portfolio migrations, drive incremental card acquisition, and stimulate spend. For example, in Spain, we are working with Financiera El Corte Ingl\u00e9s to boost the migration of closed-loop clients to our new open-loop co-badge proposition. And we're working with Saudi National Bank to enable growth in their credit portfolio by increasing penetration from their debit base. So the headline for me is the power of our strategy to drive payment network and service revenue for MasterCard. Service improved the performance of a client's portfolio, leading to incremental payment flows which lead to more opportunities to use our services, and so on, and so on. It's a virtuous circle. We also had success in expanding our customer base and services through best-in-class personalization and our leading test and learn analytics capabilities. Don't just take our word for it. Gartner recognized the superior value proposition of dynamic yields, personalization activities, and selected it as the leader in its 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for the third year in a row. That's why luxury brands like Saks Fifth Avenue work with us to create hyper-personalized experiences for their e-commerce customers. This quarter, we extended our partnership with the merchant ALDI in both the U.S. and Australia to continue to leverage our test and learn platform to optimize category reviews, store hours, and marketing spend. And we're working with Duncan International to enhance their foundational data analytics capabilities to improve operational efficiencies. Our best-in-class solutions address the unique needs of a diverse set of customers, giving us ample opportunity to continue to grow across our value-add services and solutions. We have a strong foundation for growth in P2M, as discussed, new-flows and services, and we are also embracing new opportunities for future growth. As digital adoption continues to rise, open banking remains a key opportunity. We have a powerful set of assets with connectivity to over 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. and 3,000 banks across Europe. We engage with a broad set of partners who are increasingly interested in the scale and potential of the open banking solutions we bring. This includes the account-to-account bill payments use case. Our open banking solutions enhance existing ACH flows by providing a simple and secure experience, allowing consumers to seamlessly share data with trusted parties. A previously announced partnership with JPMorgan Payments, Pay-by-Bank is now live, and Verizon plans to pilot this offering with their U.S. customers in the coming months. In addition to this, we're now collaborating with Worldpay to enable consumers to pay bills directly from their bank account. Our progress here continues. So in summary, our third quarter results reflect the strong fundamentals of our business and the continued resilience in consumer spending. There are substantial runways supported by opportunities to digitize person-to-merchant payments across both the dollar volume of flows and the number of transactions, and opportunities to address new payment flows and extend our diverse suite of services, all while we continue to invest in future areas for growth. When you put it all together, our diversified business is well-positioned for strong growth for years to come. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting resilient domestic consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth, as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased nine%, including a one ppt increase from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 21% and 24%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth, as well as a net tax benefit, which was primarily discrete due to U.S. tax guidance released in the current period. EPS was $3.39, which includes a nine-cent contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $475 million through October 23, 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, increased by 11% year over year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 5%, with credit growth of 7% and debit growth of 4%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13%, with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 14%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the net West portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 21% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q2, this is due to tougher comps as we lapped the cross-border travel recovery from last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, as Michael said, cross-border travel remained strong at 155% of 2019 levels in Q3, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to hold up well. Turning now to Page 5, switch transactions grew 15% year over year in Q3. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. We also continue to increase the percentage of transactions we switch. This is strategically important for us as it presents a revenue growth opportunity in both payments and services. An example of this is in Japan, where we began switching domestic transactions last September. In Q3 2023, we switched over 65% of our total transactions worldwide. For historical context, this figure was approximately 55% in 2018. In addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to slide six, for a look into our net revenues for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 14% relative to a strong Q3, a year ago. So let me give you a little bit of color. Our cyber and intelligence solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace driven by our underlying key drivers and demand for our fraud and security solutions. And we continue to see strong demand for our consulting and marketing services, as well as our loyalty solutions, which is partially tempered by other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7, to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric, domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 26%, while cross-border volumes increased 21%. The five ppt difference is primarily due to mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 11%, while switch transactions grew 15%. The four ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Our network assessments related to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees were $229 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, including a one ppt impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now turning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the third quarter and through the first three weeks of October. Starting with switched volume growth year over year, we lapped the NatWest migration early in the quarter and the commencement of switching in Japan late in the quarter. These factors are the primary drivers of the sequential declines in both Q3 and into October. One point on the U.S., the sequential drop in October primarily relates to the timing of certain Social Security payments this year versus last. Switch transactions follow similar patterns. Looking at cross-border, cross-border travel growth is being impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel. When compared to the 2019 index, cross-border travel metrics remain strong. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to show strength. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from the schedule, excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. So let me start by saying consumer spending remains resilient and that our diversified business model continues to position us well for the many opportunities ahead. That being said, we are closely monitoring the elevated macro and geopolitical concerns and stand ready to adjust expenses should circumstances warrant. Consumer spending patterns continue to normalize post-pandemic, while pockets of opportunity remain for further recovery of cross-border travel, notably into and out of China. This will take some time as these corridors continue to face a variety of constraints. Having said this, our base case scenario continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor markets, and reflects recent spending dynamics. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to have a minimal impact to this growth. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q4, foreign exchange is now expected to be a tailwind of approximately zero to one ppt for the quarter, as compared to the three to four ppt benefit we had previously expected. This follows the impact we saw in the third quarter where the stronger dollar led to a foreign exchange benefit of two ppt to revenue, down from our initial expectations of a three ppt benefit. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about one ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of between zero to one ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $85 million for Q4. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% in Q4, based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Audra, you can now open the call now for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Sachin, when we look at that fourth-quarter revenue deceleration, I think what the outlook implies, how much of it is, like, macro versus timing of incentives or something like that? I'm just curious, what factors are sort of driving that, and how we should think about that outlook, if there's still moderating trends going forward? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Sanjay. So, a couple of thoughts. One, in the fourth quarter, you remember last year, we continued to experience elevated levels of FX volatility in the fourth quarter of last year. And those FX volatility levels are certainly moderated by a meaningful extent. You saw some of that come through in Q3. There's more that we would expect at current volatility levels in Q4. So that's certainly, baked into our thinking. And then to your point around rebates and incentives, look, we continue to compete in this market, and we have a strong pipeline of deals. We continue to win, as you've seen, in the nature of the various announcements we've put out. And I would say our planning, for planning purposes, we're continuing to, execute on the strong pipeline. You would expect that contra sequentially would be up as a percentage of our, assessment revenue in the fourth quarter, not too different than what you would see in any other year. We typically have higher contra levels in the fourth quarter when you look at them as a percentage of our assessment revenue. So really, that's what's there. And to your specific point around macro, it's like I said, our base case assumes, a resilient consumer. And that's very much what we're assuming going forward as well. there are always puts and takes depending on markets in question, but broadly speaking, we continue to see a strong consumer.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Thanks. Good morning to everyone. Just on the Europe front, I noted that it's so a little bit, the four points, I think, sequentially, Euro and Euro. Is that just a NatWest comp out? Is there anything else to call out? I'm curious if you saw any change in or interesting performance country by country in Europe. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Tien-Tsin, so a couple of thoughts. First, it's primarily the lapping effect of NatWest. So let's start there. there are always going to be puts and takes by country. I would say that, Michael talked a little bit about in select international markets, we're seeing some level of moderation. I would say in Europe, you're seeing that in the UK. But largely, if you see the decel, which you're talking about, that's largely driven by the lapping of our NatWest win last year.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks for clarifying. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good morning. I want to ask about regulation. There's been some unrelated activity recently with Fed proposing new debit interchange caps, REG-II implementation for China present and the credit card competition bill. So Michael, taking a step back, how are you thinking about the regulatory environment in the U.S. and abroad? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Harshita. Thank you for directing that straight to me after a few questions on trends. But, there is certainly a lot going on. So that's for sure true. it's a lot of activity and they have been overlapping, REG-II, CCCA, the Fed on debit. So all this is related in a way, but it's also not related in a way. And I think this is important for us to take them one by one. And, without any particular order, let me start with CCCA, which has been a topic on this call for a little while. this topic is garnering a lot of momentum across our industry and industry participants. We are seeing a more united voice across banks and across merchants to address this point. Senators Durbin and Marshall have been very active over the last quarter since we last walked to attach this particular legislation proposal to other proposals and get a vote. They were not successful. And I think we actively used the time and productively used the time to bring across that this is not good for consumers. It is not good for small business. It is not good for merchants, particularly those who are driving large reward programs. So for all those reasons, we think this is a misguided proposal, a misguided legislation. We'll see where it goes going forward. But I have not been more optimistic on the industry pulling together to making those arguments understood than at this point. So this is CCCA. We're closely engaged on that. Now, on REG-II; so we're in compliance with that. Have we seen any particular outcome? I think it was a question on last call. Do you see this as an opportunity or as a risk? At this point, neither; what I can tell you is we will compete. We have invested billions over the years in the security of our network proposition and we think security is at the center of this whole debate. Can the merchant take away decisions from a consumer here and route this to the least cost and possibly the least secure network? Well, that is what we want to point out. That shouldn't be the case. We're leaning in on that. We haven't seen it yet at this point. So for us to just monitor and see what happens, we'll surely talk about it again next quarter. The Fed debit pricing piece that was put out yesterday is going into a consulting period. Here again, the same kind of momentum across the industry, across the American Bankers Association, the Electronic Payments Council, put out a letter to the Fed on Friday night along with seven other trades, if I recall correctly, arguing that price caps are generally driving market distortions. This is not a good thing. It's not a good thing for the consumer. Yet again, not a good thing for merchants who run reward programs and so forth. So we'll have to see where it goes. It is important, though, to point out that interchange is a balancing mechanism for the industry. It does not directly affect our P&L. So those are important things to keep in mind. For all of those, we see ourselves as an industry custodian to make sure that the arguments around safety and security and consumer choice are fully understood by all stakeholders.\nHarshita Rawat: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Craig Moore at FT Partners.\nUnknown speaker: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, two; one, considering what we're seeing in the U.S. with deterioration in certain, should I say, credit quality buckets and so on and so forth, I'm curious if you could discuss how your spend in the U.S. has broken down between sort of the top 1% and the rest versus historical levels. It just might help us understand how insulated spend is to the specific credit issues we might be seeing over the next six months. And secondly, we've seen some pretty strong rhetoric out of Asia regarding moving away from the global networks due to actions taken around Russia and other places. I was wondering if you could comment on how discussions with those markets might have changed in recent times. Thanks.\nAshwin B.S: Hey, Craig. It's Ashwin. I'll take your first question on the spending trends in the U.S. and particularly in light of what you're talking about on the deterioration of credit quality. The headline for you is the following. Our portfolio in the U.S. is actually a pretty well-diversified portfolio across all spectrums of the consumer base. If you look at our company 10 years ago, I would argue it was a company which was more kind of weighted toward our credit portfolio. We have got a better mix right now of credit and debit across the spectrum of consumers. And diversification has always been our friend, whether it's around products, whether it's around geographical markets. That's kind of the way we've kind of tried to drive the strategy of the business. I would tell you, I mean, if you look at the composition of the issuers in the U.S., right, so we have a decent amount of, co-brand portfolios which cater to the affluent. And hopefully, from a credit quality standpoint, they stand to actually hold up pretty well even in, in down markets. The other piece I tell you is that we like the fact that we have been recently investing in winning debit portfolios. We've talked about how we won citizens. We talked about -- Michael just talked about how we won Webster. These are important portfolios because, as in up and down cycles, right, what happens with the diversified portfolios in down cycles, debit tends to be in favor because of the spend going toward these non-discretionary categories of spend. So, the headline I tell you is pretty well diversified across products and across the spectrum of consumers in the U.S.\nMichael Miebach: And as we were saying earlier, we're monitoring credit availability. Credit availability is not an issue as far as we can see. At this point, it's beyond historic level. It's below historic level. So that's something that is part of our continuing efforts to understand where the dynamics are going. Now on Asia, you answered the question on their strong rhetoric from Asia. I would probably word this differently and say we're not seeing that. We're seeing this is an argument in a broader conversation around where value is coming from, the value of globalization and global connectivity. On the other hand, things like sanctions play into this. It's a very complex mix. And across the world, not just in Asia, there's a conversation around weighing all of that off. So it's important for you to understand that we have been partnering with countries around the world for years. Just take Europe to start with. Early on, we talked about Maestro and Debit Mastercard. We're partnering with a whole range of local payment systems for years. And there are no particular concerns around that. The same is in many other parts of the world. Where this is going and going forward, we'll have yet to see. But it is understood that as part of a globally connected economy and a world where some de-risking plays into that, trusted cross-border data flows matter. People still want to travel. And all of that makes us an important player. Also keep in mind that our capabilities across network level, trusted solutions, cyber-security solutions, gets us a seat at the table. We're seen as a technology company, a global technology company, not necessarily as a U.S. payment brand when we have those conversations because we help across. We enable local payment solutions through those services. So I'm not overly worried about this, but it's an active dialogue where we are seeing some really good things coming out of that. Think about some of the advancements in financial inclusion when local governments set up systems that reach consumers that haven't been reached before. That lifts everybody's boat. And that is good for the overall payments industry. So it is a broad topic. We've been engaging through the U.S. government, through other governments, multilateral organizations. And I personally spend quite a bit of time on that topic to ensure that we don't lose the benefit of a globally connected economy.\nUnknown speaker: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Will Nance at Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to ask about some of the trends in value-added services. It sounds like the commentary this quarter was similar to last quarter, kind of a tale of two S's, relatively strong growth in services, and maybe a little bit of drag from solutions. I was just wondering if you could talk on the drag-in solutions, a little bit of color on what's driving that, and maybe for the outlook, how long should we kind of expect that drag to continue and what's sort of the outlook for the two buckets?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Will. So a couple of thoughts first. Like we mentioned in my prepared remarks, value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 14% this quarter. I will kind of emphasize that our cyber and intelligence solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace. This obviously is driven by underlying drivers as well as demand for our various solutions which we offer. And we're seeing similar trends in terms of strong demand for our consulting, marketing, and other quality solutions. To your point about the tempering effect of other solutions, that certainly is having a tempering effect. And what we have in other solutions is the relative growth rates from real-time payments, from what's going on from a bill payment standpoint. It's things of that nature which are actually growing at a slower pace, which is, candidly, I mean, something which we should expect. The reality is we've always talked about services in the past. We haven't talked about value-added services and solutions. Now we're talking about value-added services and solutions, which is where you're seeing that tempering effect come through. I think if it's helpful, one of the things which I want to actually also share with you is that this overall growth rate can be impacted quarter to quarter by transaction growth, by comps, and by timing. And just as a reference point, when excluding other solutions which have the tempering effect, our value-added services have grown at 19% year-over-year on a year-to-date basis, excluding Russia. So I think what I'm kind of trying to share with you is there is this tempering effect on other solutions. You should expect that tempering effect to continue. All of that being said, there is the overall strength we see in our CNI and DNS side, which we're actually very positive of, we're seeing good demand in that space.\nWill Nance: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Togut at Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Given some of the tempering growth that you've highlighted, especially in VAS, how are you thinking about flexing expenses over the next six to 12 months? Where do you have a fair amount of discretion? And what are some of the areas, particularly like R&D, which would be sacrosanct?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So what Sachin said, he wasn't really talking about tempering in VAS. He was talking about tempering in the other solutions. So I just want to kind of get that straight out. I think there is potentially a little bit of confusion here with our revenue disaggregation and the definitions here. We've talked about services in a particular way for years, and now we have a slightly different definition, as which we shared with you. So I just want to put that out there first. To your question, so we continue to expect strong growth in value-added services and solutions, DNS and CSI, as we said. As far as expenses go, I said it at the beginning, looking at macro, looking at everything that's going on around us, and we have demonstrated this through COVID, we have demonstrated it through Russia, and we will continue to demonstrate as we have a whole range of levers in a not particularly capital-heavy business to adjust our expenses. You've seen us managing for positive bottom-line and top-line growth on a year-over-year basis. We're not managing this quarter by quarter, but that is always something that we keep in mind. So our financial discipline will continue here. We have no reason to change that. It's working well, and that is the disciplined way to do this. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: And David, I'll just add, just as Michael said, I think our philosophy from an operations standpoint is to continue to deliver positive operating leverage over the long term. We will do that in a disciplined manner to continue to drive short, medium, and long-term growth, and we will invest prudently. And we will obviously keep an eye on what's going on on the top line and kind of moderate on expenses as appropriate, as we've done historically. So I just want to reiterate exactly what Michael said there. Thank you.\nDavid Togut: Yeah. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Next, to Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Good morning. Sachin, I just wanted to ask about more chunkier portfolios and the timing of it. Obviously, NatWest anniversary, that might have surprised some people on the comps, but it's just an anniversary of that. So just thinking about Citizens or Webster or others, the timing on when they come on and any others out there?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Brian. So on Citizens, the portfolio transition is on track for 2024. You should expect that that will take place over a period of time as opposed to a flip-the-switch kind of environment. Webster, we just announced, which we're super excited about, right? And the portfolio transition will also begin in 2024 and will take place over a period of time. Santander is done. NatWest I already spoke about. The other one, actually, which I kind of point out is Deutsche Bank, right? And there we had talked about conversion of 10 million cards. That conversion has started. It's a combination of debit and credit. It will happen over an extended period of time. Again, it's not a flip-the-switch kind of scenario. And the last one I'd mention is around Unicredit, which is something which will happen over multiple years. So this is not, and when I say multiple years, I literally mean you'll start in 2024 and this will work its way through over a few years. So that's what I can share with you in terms of at least the chunky ones. Obviously, there are a bunch of other portfolios which we went, all the time, but these are the bigger ones.\nBryan Keane: Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo at UBS.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to take this as an opportunity to revisit some of the mechanics around rebates and incentives. If you could just provide a recap on the portions of rebates and incentives that are volume and performance-based, some of the portions that are maybe more fixed, and then the portions that are more cumulative over the course of a contract? I think that would be appreciated by all. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So first, the reason we do rebates and incentives is to drive volume. I just want to be clear. That's kind of what drives, what we're trying to do, which is to win preference, which allows us to generate revenue from the payment stream, as well as to deliver services to drive our net revenue yield. So that's kind of the headline. Your specific question around rebates and incentives, right, it's a combination typically of fixed and variable. It depends on a deal-by-deal basis. If it's a fixed incentive, the fixed incentive is typically amortized over the life of the deal. Variable incentives are variable in nature. They vary with the volume, which are coming through, and they are timed with how the volume rolls on. So that's kind of the highest level. The other piece I'd kind of share with you is, rebates and incentives are typically more indexed toward domestic volumes, less indexed toward cross-border. So those are the salient pieces I'd mention to you on rebates and incentives.\nTim Chiodo: Greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Dolev at Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Hey. Thanks. Michael, I just want to give you a compliment first because this is close to my heart, and I appreciate you mentioning the terror attack on Israel. I think your competitor made it more like of a politically correct comment on their call, so I really appreciate it. And then to my question, a key European merchant acquirer called out a big negative trend in Germany, and as the whole market trended down. Can you make some specific comments on how much of that was stuff that you were seeing? Because it seems like trends are actually pretty solid and pretty resilient, so there's quite a bit of confusion in the market. We would appreciate some comments on the European macro trend. Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Dan. As you can appreciate, I keep a close eye on the German market very specifically, and I think there's a lot of confusion and we're not seeing that. Consumer spending remains pretty steady in Germany and generally in Europe. Sachin talked a little bit about one U.K. might have a little bit of moderation here and there, but overall we're not seeing that. So what we see on the other hand, as is strong growth for us in Europe on all the migrations, on our debit maestro migrations and so forth. So Europe's been a bright star, continues to be for us. So we don't quite relate to what others are reporting.\nDan Dolev: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the incentives and rebates. But first, just, Michael, the number of portfolios that you guys are winning on the different parts of the world, really, but just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, whether it's Unicredit or now Citizens and how that dovetails into incentives and rebates because the growth, I mean, you're about five, 600 basis points faster than gross revenues you're seeing on it. Maybe that part's a more first action. And it offsets some of the exciting opportunities we're seeing on gross revenue growth kind of in a few quarters in a row now. And so I just want to get a better sense of what you're seeing in terms of, anything structural on rebates, incentives that may be a bit different and tied to winning business, or is it just more business as usual and not necessarily a competitive landscape? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Let me start off here. So I want to reiterate what Sachin said before. We are trying to win portfolios that are important for market relevance perspective for us to gain access to transactions to drive our services model and, follow through on that virtuous circle that I talked about earlier in my remarks. So that's the whole idea. We keep net revenue yield in mind as we do all of this. That is the integrated payments competitive landscape. Payments is competitive. There's a lot of players out on the landscape. we like competition and we feel we have a truly unique proposition between our payments and digital solutions on one hand and our services on the other hand. So when you think about Unicredit, so why did they come to us? Well, they were looking at our proven track record in our engagement with Unicredit for the expanded relationships and supporting their customers. They like our sustainability agenda. On Citizens, it was a similar kind of mix and on Webster, yet again, it was a similar kind of mix. There's always something across the portfolio of services that sticks out. Citizens, I recall a conversation on open banking, for example. That is clearly one that mattered and the sustainability agenda yet again. So it's a mix. There is nothing particularly new here. We always weigh off the volume growth that we can see with the incentives that we give to make this whole equation work for us in a very disciplined manner. We do not want to win. So we're very disciplined about that and I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, but I want to hand over to Sachin to give us a little more color on that.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So, Darren, I think Michael covered kind of the competitive landscape. I think your specific question around the divergence, not divergence, but the fact that gross revenue is growing at a faster clip and the incentives are actually impacting the growth on the net revenue side. The reality is in the growth business, the growth portfolio is up front. Going back to the earlier question which was asked, when you're doing a combination of fixed and variable incentives, fixed incentives start to amortize the moment a deal goes live. That doesn't mean the volumes come on at full speed when the deal goes live. Because like we talk, we talk about conversions happening over multiple years. If a conversion happens right away, you get the volume right away and you start to see the associated impact from a revenue standpoint. So there is this lag which exists between when we're recognizing the impact of those incentives and when we would expect at full ramp the volumes to come on as we win deals. But that's more of a technicality as in how the math around that works. I think the bottom line still remains which is we would rather be in the payment flow on a disciplined basis to be able to drive higher net revenue yield for our company than not be in the flow. Because you're not in the flow, you're not getting the benefit of PCE, you're not getting the benefit of cash, which are moving from cash to electronic forms of payment, and you're certainly not getting the ability to deliver certain levels of services which we got out there. So that's kind of the broad philosophy from a competitive standpoint that we've chosen to take here.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey. Thanks. So I want to talk about a by-Bank. It's live with JPMorgan. I mean, Verizon is piloting. Can you speak to the momentum you're seeing in the product? And given that it uses traditional ACH banking rails, could you maybe more broadly speak to the economic model for this and similar products that maybe tend to not use Mastercard rails?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So this is a combination of bill pay, of open banking. This is for us sitting in the new flow space. Very specifically, what we are addressing is trying to bring value to ACH flows. These are, somebody paying a doctor or things like that. And how do we add value to this is by plugging onto a flow that would take place and might not happen because of insufficient funds on an account. We're putting in our open banking connection to make it clear is there a balance on the account. It's called the payment success indicator. That is the product. And it is a per-click fee related to the API call. So that is the model. That is bringing value to a part of the payments industry where there wasn't a particular problem to be solved and not anybody willing to pay for it. I think we're starting to find these corners where there is real value that we can bring. So for us, this is TAM expansion. This is new flows. And as I said, we're bringing our unique combination of services together. We are in real-time payments and we are in digital identity and we're in open banking. All of this is needed here to make the solution work. And this is why a player like JPMorgan comes to us to do this for us. And Verizon, to the point about momentum, will now be piloting it. So it would be a little early to talk about momentum. But we'll come back on that as that solution is then rolled out into the market. But it is now live. And that was an important point for us, because it had to be built and put together and we have done that.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeff Cantwell at Seaport Research.\nJeff Cantwell: Hey. Thanks. I wanted to ask about your business update in October specifically. We can see in the U.S. switched volume growth is 5%. So that's 200 bps slower versus the 7% you did this quarter. But can you talk a little more about how you see the holiday season developing this year? Because we've seen some estimates that consumer spend could increase by 5% versus last year, which sounds pretty good all things considered. You highlighted resilience and consumer spend this quarter. So I just wanted to take your temperature on how the entire quarter might develop, specifically in the U.S. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Jeff. So on the U.S. specifically, what you're seeing in the day 21 numbers is, like I said in my prepared remarks, it's primarily related to the timing of Social Security payments between this year and last year. So that's really what you're seeing in the nature of that 7% growth in Q3, which now shows that 5% in the first three weeks of October. So this really, from an underlying standpoint, other than that, there's not much we're seeing in the nature of a trend shift in the U.S. in the first three weeks of October. On your question about how we see Q4 shaping up, it's actually very much in line with what I shared, which is basically a scenario continues to be one of where the consumer remains resilient. I mean, the reality is, unemployment levels are at all-time record lows. When people have jobs, they hopefully are getting their paychecks, which they're hopefully using toward meeting their spending needs. You also saw GDP came out this morning and it came out pretty strong. So I kind of generally think about this as saying our base case scenario around consumer strength and resilience is what we're assuming going into Q4.\nJeff Cantwell: OK. Thanks very much.\nSachin Mehra: Sure\nOperator: We'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Dan Dola's question earlier and I'm wondering about the sort of dislocation between your valuation and the marketplace and the valuation of your distribution channels, the acquirers, and banks that sort of flow transactions to you. Can you give us your updated thoughts on the overall health and TAM penetration of this core kind of value chain? When you look at the heritage distribution channels on both sides, are you seeing upheaval or are you seeing stability? In other words, are the market kind of getting the same benefits as the other?\nMichael Miebach: All right. Hey, Ramsey, let me start off on that. So if you look at how our distribution has evolved over the years, the whole theme of diversification across products and segments also applies here. So we're doing a whole number of things. I talked about our work on acceptance. That is part of our distribution where contactless, tap on phone, things like that, a whole range of new merchant groups scaling these kind of technologies with partners like Stripe. Those are all going into areas that we haven't been in. Then you have other parts of our go to market. We talked about in B2B, we talked about Oracle and SAP. You go over into the world of acquirers. There's a whole range of acquirers, more traditional acquirers, which are our partners. So across the board, it's highly diversified, it's regionally highly diversified. So these blips here really talk about other people's business. But earlier on the question around what we're seeing in Europe, we're just not seeing it in our numbers because we have a highly diversified model. So whatever specific sector focus somebody has that is a partner of ours doesn't necessarily throw through for us. So I don't know if the market got it wrong or not. We're not the Oracle, but we make sure we partner with everybody to drive the overall digital ecosystem.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Bob Napoli at William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on commentary around the open banking, banking as a service. And MasterCard also, you've done a great job of partnering with a lot of fintechs. We were just at Money 2020, and I would say this year there were a lot more regulators than I remember in the past. And talking about open banking and how active they are in reviewing all the partners in those relationships. So just any thoughts on your outlook for your open banking investments and then how you think about the regulation, the growing regulation around open banking or banking as a service?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So we continue to believe in the whole notion of open banking and open data at large, where people and businesses use their own data to drive toward better services and better propositions for them. So the idea stands. And I think the idea gets hold and hold. If you look at Europe with, more regulation coming in, looking at PSD3 and so forth, you're looking at the CFPB here in the United States putting out some thoughts on how regulation could look like. For us, I put this in context of the idea is understood. How do you make it safer? What does that need? It needs trusted parties in the middle. We're in a world full of a bunch of bilateral relationships where people exchange data in a not so safe way. That would be a bad world. That's what regulators want to prohibit. We're coming in and saying we could be one of those parties that really bring the idea to life for consumers. I can use my data for better financial services. So when I look at what the CFPB has put out, we largely support the idea. It aligns very well with our data responsibility principles that we put out. It's your data, the consumer. You benefit from it. You control it. It is our role as a company to keep it safe, and we're very good at that. So our interlocking circles stand for trust. For open banking to work, you need trust. I think that is where we're going. So we're engaging. In fact, we're oftentimes in the room when these things are being thought about. In Europe, we were very much part of the dialogue on how data privacy on this context will look like.\nOperator: And we'll take that last question from Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks, guys. I just wanted to flashback to the analyst day two years ago. I know you had shared a three-year guide at the time for revenue CAGR of high teens through 2024, and it looks like you'll basically be right there through the first two years of that forecast period. So I just wanted to take your temperature on that three-year outlook and give you a rearview mirror.\nMichael Miebach: Yeah, Jason. So, look, we're not updating anything on the three-year outlook at this point in time. It's like you said, the first year actually turned out to be a very nice year. Again, in the second year, we've delivered quite strongly year to date, and then we've shared with you what we think will happen from an expectation standpoint in Q4. The one thing I just want to kind of orient everybody to is that we're in a very, very volatile time, and the world has actually changed quite meaningfully since then, which is what I'm alluding to here is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and our suspension of activities in Russia. So that's something to keep in mind. We certainly keep it in mind as part of the fact that what we were assuming at that point in time in period Russia right now, obviously we don't have revenues related to Russia, which are coming through. But beyond that, I have nothing really to share in terms of updated thoughts around our three-year outlook.\nDevin Corr: So thank you for the questions today. Thank you for the trust in MasterCard. I always thank our people. And this is yet again the moment to do this. Times are not that easy for everybody, and they're leaning in, and they're leaning in for our customers. So thank you to everybody at MasterCard who is on the call, and thank you to all of you who listened in and asked questions. Speak to you one quarter from now. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: [Operator signoff]",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Now turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting resilient domestic consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth, as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased nine%, including a one ppt increase from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 21% and 24%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth, as well as a net tax benefit, which was primarily discrete due to U.S. tax guidance released in the current period. EPS was $3.39, which includes a nine-cent contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $475 million through October 23, 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, increased by 11% year over year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 5%, with credit growth of 7% and debit growth of 4%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13%, with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 14%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the net West portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 21% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q2, this is due to tougher comps as we lapped the cross-border travel recovery from last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, as Michael said, cross-border travel remained strong at 155% of 2019 levels in Q3, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to hold up well. Turning now to Page 5, switch transactions grew 15% year over year in Q3. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. We also continue to increase the percentage of transactions we switch. This is strategically important for us as it presents a revenue growth opportunity in both payments and services. An example of this is in Japan, where we began switching domestic transactions last September. In Q3 2023, we switched over 65% of our total transactions worldwide. For historical context, this figure was approximately 55% in 2018. In addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to slide six, for a look into our net revenues for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 14% relative to a strong Q3, a year ago. So let me give you a little bit of color. Our cyber and intelligence solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace driven by our underlying key drivers and demand for our fraud and security solutions. And we continue to see strong demand for our consulting and marketing services, as well as our loyalty solutions, which is partially tempered by other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7, to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric, domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 11%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 26%, while cross-border volumes increased 21%. The five ppt difference is primarily due to mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 11%, while switch transactions grew 15%. The four ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Our network assessments related to licensing, implementation, and other franchise fees were $229 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, including a one ppt impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now turning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the third quarter and through the first three weeks of October. Starting with switched volume growth year over year, we lapped the NatWest migration early in the quarter and the commencement of switching in Japan late in the quarter. These factors are the primary drivers of the sequential declines in both Q3 and into October. One point on the U.S., the sequential drop in October primarily relates to the timing of certain Social Security payments this year versus last. Switch transactions follow similar patterns. Looking at cross-border, cross-border travel growth is being impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel. When compared to the 2019 index, cross-border travel metrics remain strong. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel continues to show strength. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from the schedule, excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts on Q4. So let me start by saying consumer spending remains resilient and that our diversified business model continues to position us well for the many opportunities ahead. That being said, we are closely monitoring the elevated macro and geopolitical concerns and stand ready to adjust expenses should circumstances warrant. Consumer spending patterns continue to normalize post-pandemic, while pockets of opportunity remain for further recovery of cross-border travel, notably into and out of China. This will take some time as these corridors continue to face a variety of constraints. Having said this, our base case scenario continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor markets, and reflects recent spending dynamics. With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year net revenue to grow at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are expected to have a minimal impact to this growth. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q4, foreign exchange is now expected to be a tailwind of approximately zero to one ppt for the quarter, as compared to the three to four ppt benefit we had previously expected. This follows the impact we saw in the third quarter where the stronger dollar led to a foreign exchange benefit of two ppt to revenue, down from our initial expectations of a three ppt benefit. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about one ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of between zero to one ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $85 million for Q4. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% to 19% in Q4, based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Sure, Sanjay. So, a couple of thoughts. One, in the fourth quarter, you remember last year, we continued to experience elevated levels of FX volatility in the fourth quarter of last year. And those FX volatility levels are certainly moderated by a meaningful extent. You saw some of that come through in Q3. There's more that we would expect at current volatility levels in Q4. So that's certainly, baked into our thinking. And then to your point around rebates and incentives, look, we continue to compete in this market, and we have a strong pipeline of deals. We continue to win, as you've seen, in the nature of the various announcements we've put out. And I would say our planning, for planning purposes, we're continuing to, execute on the strong pipeline. You would expect that contra sequentially would be up as a percentage of our, assessment revenue in the fourth quarter, not too different than what you would see in any other year. We typically have higher contra levels in the fourth quarter when you look at them as a percentage of our assessment revenue. So really, that's what's there. And to your specific point around macro, it's like I said, our base case assumes, a resilient consumer. And that's very much what we're assuming going forward as well. there are always puts and takes depending on markets in question, but broadly speaking, we continue to see a strong consumer. Sure, Tien-Tsin, so a couple of thoughts. First, it's primarily the lapping effect of NatWest. So let's start there. there are always going to be puts and takes by country. I would say that, Michael talked a little bit about in select international markets, we're seeing some level of moderation. I would say in Europe, you're seeing that in the UK. But largely, if you see the decel, which you're talking about, that's largely driven by the lapping of our NatWest win last year. Sure, Will. So a couple of thoughts first. Like we mentioned in my prepared remarks, value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 14% this quarter. I will kind of emphasize that our cyber and intelligence solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace. This obviously is driven by underlying drivers as well as demand for our various solutions which we offer. And we're seeing similar trends in terms of strong demand for our consulting, marketing, and other quality solutions. To your point about the tempering effect of other solutions, that certainly is having a tempering effect. And what we have in other solutions is the relative growth rates from real-time payments, from what's going on from a bill payment standpoint. It's things of that nature which are actually growing at a slower pace, which is, candidly, I mean, something which we should expect. The reality is we've always talked about services in the past. We haven't talked about value-added services and solutions. Now we're talking about value-added services and solutions, which is where you're seeing that tempering effect come through. I think if it's helpful, one of the things which I want to actually also share with you is that this overall growth rate can be impacted quarter to quarter by transaction growth, by comps, and by timing. And just as a reference point, when excluding other solutions which have the tempering effect, our value-added services have grown at 19% year-over-year on a year-to-date basis, excluding Russia. So I think what I'm kind of trying to share with you is there is this tempering effect on other solutions. You should expect that tempering effect to continue. All of that being said, there is the overall strength we see in our CNI and DNS side, which we're actually very positive of, we're seeing good demand in that space. And David, I'll just add, just as Michael said, I think our philosophy from an operations standpoint is to continue to deliver positive operating leverage over the long term. We will do that in a disciplined manner to continue to drive short, medium, and long-term growth, and we will invest prudently. And we will obviously keep an eye on what's going on on the top line and kind of moderate on expenses as appropriate, as we've done historically. So I just want to reiterate exactly what Michael said there. Thank you. Thanks, David. Sure, Brian. So on Citizens, the portfolio transition is on track for 2024. You should expect that that will take place over a period of time as opposed to a flip-the-switch kind of environment. Webster, we just announced, which we're super excited about, right? And the portfolio transition will also begin in 2024 and will take place over a period of time. Santander is done. NatWest I already spoke about. The other one, actually, which I kind of point out is Deutsche Bank, right? And there we had talked about conversion of 10 million cards. That conversion has started. It's a combination of debit and credit. It will happen over an extended period of time. Again, it's not a flip-the-switch kind of scenario. And the last one I'd mention is around Unicredit, which is something which will happen over multiple years. So this is not, and when I say multiple years, I literally mean you'll start in 2024 and this will work its way through over a few years. So that's what I can share with you in terms of at least the chunky ones. Obviously, there are a bunch of other portfolios which we went, all the time, but these are the bigger ones. Sure. Sure. So first, the reason we do rebates and incentives is to drive volume. I just want to be clear. That's kind of what drives, what we're trying to do, which is to win preference, which allows us to generate revenue from the payment stream, as well as to deliver services to drive our net revenue yield. So that's kind of the headline. Your specific question around rebates and incentives, right, it's a combination typically of fixed and variable. It depends on a deal-by-deal basis. If it's a fixed incentive, the fixed incentive is typically amortized over the life of the deal. Variable incentives are variable in nature. They vary with the volume, which are coming through, and they are timed with how the volume rolls on. So that's kind of the highest level. The other piece I'd kind of share with you is, rebates and incentives are typically more indexed toward domestic volumes, less indexed toward cross-border. So those are the salient pieces I'd mention to you on rebates and incentives. Sure. Sure. So, Darren, I think Michael covered kind of the competitive landscape. I think your specific question around the divergence, not divergence, but the fact that gross revenue is growing at a faster clip and the incentives are actually impacting the growth on the net revenue side. The reality is in the growth business, the growth portfolio is up front. Going back to the earlier question which was asked, when you're doing a combination of fixed and variable incentives, fixed incentives start to amortize the moment a deal goes live. That doesn't mean the volumes come on at full speed when the deal goes live. Because like we talk, we talk about conversions happening over multiple years. If a conversion happens right away, you get the volume right away and you start to see the associated impact from a revenue standpoint. So there is this lag which exists between when we're recognizing the impact of those incentives and when we would expect at full ramp the volumes to come on as we win deals. But that's more of a technicality as in how the math around that works. I think the bottom line still remains which is we would rather be in the payment flow on a disciplined basis to be able to drive higher net revenue yield for our company than not be in the flow. Because you're not in the flow, you're not getting the benefit of PCE, you're not getting the benefit of cash, which are moving from cash to electronic forms of payment, and you're certainly not getting the ability to deliver certain levels of services which we got out there. So that's kind of the broad philosophy from a competitive standpoint that we've chosen to take here. Hey, Jeff. So on the U.S. specifically, what you're seeing in the day 21 numbers is, like I said in my prepared remarks, it's primarily related to the timing of Social Security payments between this year and last year. So that's really what you're seeing in the nature of that 7% growth in Q3, which now shows that 5% in the first three weeks of October. So this really, from an underlying standpoint, other than that, there's not much we're seeing in the nature of a trend shift in the U.S. in the first three weeks of October. On your question about how we see Q4 shaping up, it's actually very much in line with what I shared, which is basically a scenario continues to be one of where the consumer remains resilient. I mean, the reality is, unemployment levels are at all-time record lows. When people have jobs, they hopefully are getting their paychecks, which they're hopefully using toward meeting their spending needs. You also saw GDP came out this morning and it came out pretty strong. So I kind of generally think about this as saying our base case scenario around consumer strength and resilience is what we're assuming going into Q4. Sure"

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning from New York, everyone. Let me start by acknowledging the recent terror attacks in Israel and the resulting war with Hamas and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We're deeply saddened by the suffering and the loss. Our focus is on the well-being of our people, those who have been directly impacted, and those in our teams around the world, who are dealing with this terrible situation. We will continue to give them support while contributing to relieve efforts. We will monitor the situation closely so we can take action as required. Turning to our results, our quarter three results demonstrate the strong fundamentals of our business, our diversified model, and the continued resilience in consumer spending. Quarter three net revenues were up 11% and operating income was up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP, currency-neutral basis, excluding special items. On a macroeconomic front, there are a few factors we focus on. First, the labor market remains strong, which is a key driver of consumer spending. However, we continue to monitor aspects such as credit availability and savings behaviors. Second, although inflation levels have moderated, they remain elevated. As central banks continue to actively manage monetary policy, we expect the impacts to vary across countries and sectors. Also, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern, further underscored by the recent events in the Middle East. We are monitoring these moving pieces and stand ready to manage the business accordingly. Looking at our switch trends this quarter, domestic volume growth remains healthy, with some moderation in spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel remains strong at 155% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. And cross-border card present X-travel continues to hold up well at 209% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. And this is cross-border card not present X-travel. So overall, consumer spending remains resilient and we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities. We see substantial runway for growth through the long-term potential in person-to-merchant payments, the sizable opportunity to address new payment flows, our diverse suite of fast-growing service capabilities, and our investments in areas of future growth like open banking and digital identity. Let's explore these in more detail. Starting with person-to-merchant payments, where we see a sizable long-term growth opportunity. We're winning deals with a diverse set of partners and investing in technology to further drive the shift to electronic forms of payment and capture new ways to pay. The third quarter, our deal momentum across the globe continued. In the US, we're happy to announce that Webster Bank, a leading commercial bank in the Northeast, has chosen MasterCard as their exclusive payment network. They selected us because of our marketing assets, safety and security tools, and commitment to small business. This builds up on recent wins in the U.S. like the Citizens Debit Portfolio Flip with the transition on track for 2024. These two wins are clear examples of the value we deliver through our partnerships and the reasons banks are willing to move their debit business to MasterCard. Further, we have partnered with Citi's wealth business to launch their ultra-high net worth credit proposition, targeting their private bank clients in Singapore and Hong Kong. And in East Africa, we signed a long-term deal with Equity Bank Group that significantly increases our share across the six markets where they have presence. On the co-brand front, we joined Barclays to launch Xbox, first credit card in the United States. Building off our long-standing relationship with Microsoft, this product is an example of how we're tapping into the fast-growing gaming space. And of course, we continue to strengthen our travel-focused programs, renewing our Frontier Airlines program issued by Barclays, as well as the Turkish Airlines program with Garanti BBVA. Winning deals positions us well to capture PCE and secular growth. There's a sizable opportunity across volumes and transactions, and we benefit from both. We're bringing together innovation, technology, the experience, and trust that consumers want and expect in their daily lives. And that starts with our best-in-class digital solutions such as Contactless and tokenization. Contactless now represents 63% of our in-person switch purchase transactions, and the convenience and security of our capabilities are helping us to further penetrate verticals like transit. By converting transit to Open-Loop, we gain access to more low-ticket, high-frequency transactions, both at the station and the surrounding merchants. The last quarter alone, we launched Open-Loop programs with two of the largest transit systems in North America, Toronto, and Philadelphia. We're now live with over 25 agencies in the U.S. and Canada. This year in the Netherlands, we supported the launch of a nationwide Contactless transit payment system. And in Pakistan, we're helping to digitize daily commutes in Karachi with issuance over one million prepaid Open-Loop cards. On tokenization, it has been 10 years since we first introduced the token standard to the industry. Today, it is foundational to the network and it's performing exceptionally well. The number of tokenized transactions has more than doubled over the past two years. We just processed over three billion tokenized transactions in one month. And this functionality is extending to new places to pay. For example, Mercedes-Benz customers in Germany can now pay for fuel directly from their vehicle using only their fingerprint. And Hyundai Motor America is enabling in-vehicle payments for parking with additional features and EV use cases to be enabled in the future. Digital solutions are also key to migrating Maestro to Debit Mastercard. This conversion drives a better cardholder experience, including in many cases, the ability to shop online and across borders, which leads to incremental card spend. And prior to full transition, we offer a virtual companion card to the current Maestro cards for immediate online use. In Europe, we're in the process of sun-setting new issuance of Maestro, and we will continue to work with our issuers on the migration of well over 100 million cards over time. A lot happening in P2M for sure. Onto the second vector for growth, new payment flows. There are substantial untapped flows across commercial payments and the disbursements and remittance space. In commercial, we continue to see strong growth. We're expanding our market-leading virtual card capabilities into new use cases. In the U.S. and Canada, our mobile payment solution is now live with BMO and TechPartner Extend, bringing our virtual card capabilities to contactless business payments. We also continue to expand our reach to corporates by partnering with Oracle to embed MasterCard virtual card capabilities into their Fusion Cloud ERP to enable supplier invoice payments and corporate purchases. And we are integrating our commercial payment and open banking capabilities into SAP Firenir platforms to deliver an embedded payment and lending experience. There remains a significant opportunity to convert cash and check to commercial card products. We're signing deals across the globe to do just that. We're excited to announce that we have agreed a long-term deal with Citibank to forge a global commercial card partnership covering more than 60 markets. The deal extends our leadership position with Citibank and reinforces our efforts to modernize and grow B2B payment flows. We also signed our first ever commercial contract with Axis Bank in India and a commercial deal with the biggest investment bank in Latin America, BTG Pactual. Now, let's focus on disbursements and remittances. With access to more than 95% of the world's bank population, our reach spans more than 180 countries and more than 150 currencies. And we are seeing strong growth. In the third quarter, transactions were up more than 30% on a year-over-year basis. To continue growing in this space, we're expanding into new use cases and geographies. A great example is our partnership with Remitly, one of the fastest growing digital remittance platforms with over five million active users. Remitly will leverage our disbursement and remittance solutions to help make international payments faster, easier, and more secure. We're also expanding our collaboration with Paysend in the U.K. to enhance cross-border payments for SMEs. Now our value-add services and solutions are another important driver for our growth. Collectively, this suite of capabilities is fast-growing and provides a diversified revenue stream. We have invested thoughtfully to develop services focused on supporting our customers in areas of growing need. Cybersecurity threats are rising, a trend that will unfortunately persist. And there's an increasing demand for actionable insights and more personalized experiences. Our services, bolstered by our data-driven intelligence, can help customers reduce fraud, grow their portfolios, and better engage with their end customers. Take our cyber solutions, which protect consumers and the payments ecosystem more broadly. One example is SafetyNet, which in the past 12 months has prevented more than $20 billion in fraud. This is just one of our many fraud solutions that we're deploying to deliver more value and support continued growth. AI also continues to play a critical role powering our products and fueling our network intelligence. We're scaling our AI-powered transaction fraud monitoring solution, which delivers real-time predictive scores based on a unique blend of customer and network-level insights. This powerful solution gives our customers the ability to take preventive action before the transaction is authorized. This quarter alone, we signed agreements in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria with financial institutions and Fintech's, who will benefit from early fraud detection and with merchants who will experience less friction and higher approval rates. In the end, this all makes for a better consumer experience. We're also using our services, combining our data and expertise to help clients optimize and do more with their portfolios. This drives both direct services revenue and incremental payments revenue. Our consulting, marketing services, and targeting analytics help clients design and execute portfolio migrations, drive incremental card acquisition, and stimulate spend. For example, in Spain, we are working with Financiera El Corte Ingle\u0301s to boost the migration of closed-loop clients to our new open-loop co-badge proposition. And we're working with Saudi National Bank to enable growth in their credit portfolio by increasing penetration from their debit base. So the headline for me is the power of our strategy to drive payment network and service revenue for MasterCard. Service improved the performance of a client's portfolio, leading to incremental payment flows which lead to more opportunities to use our services, and so on, and so on. It's a virtuous circle. We also had success in expanding our customer base and services through best-in-class personalization and our leading test and learn analytics capabilities. Don't just take our word for it. Gartner recognized the superior value proposition of dynamic yields, personalization activities, and selected it as the leader in its 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for the third year in a row. That's why luxury brands like Saks Fifth Avenue work with us to create hyper-personalized experiences for their e-commerce customers. This quarter, we extended our partnership with the merchant ALDI in both the U.S. and Australia to continue to leverage our test and learn platform to optimize category reviews, store hours, and marketing spend. And we're working with Duncan International to enhance their foundational data analytics capabilities to improve operational efficiencies. Our best-in-class solutions address the unique needs of a diverse set of customers, giving us ample opportunity to continue to grow across our value-add services and solutions. We have a strong foundation for growth in P2M, as discussed, new-flows and services, and we are also embracing new opportunities for future growth. As digital adoption continues to rise, open banking remains a key opportunity. We have a powerful set of assets with connectivity to over 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. and 3,000 banks across Europe. We engage with a broad set of partners who are increasingly interested in the scale and potential of the open banking solutions we bring. This includes the account-to-account bill payments use case. Our open banking solutions enhance existing ACH flows by providing a simple and secure experience, allowing consumers to seamlessly share data with trusted parties. A previously announced partnership with JPMorgan Payments, Pay-by-Bank is now live, and Verizon plans to pilot this offering with their U.S. customers in the coming months. In addition to this, we're now collaborating with Worldpay to enable consumers to pay bills directly from their bank account. Our progress here continues. So in summary, our third quarter results reflect the strong fundamentals of our business and the continued resilience in consumer spending. There are substantial runways supported by opportunities to digitize person-to-merchant payments across both the dollar volume of flows and the number of transactions, and opportunities to address new payment flows and extend our diverse suite of services, all while we continue to invest in future areas for growth. When you put it all together, our diversified business is well-positioned for strong growth for years to come. Sachin, over to you. Thank you, Harshita. Thank you for directing that straight to me after a few questions on trends. But, there is certainly a lot going on. So that's for sure true. it's a lot of activity and they have been overlapping, REG-II, CCCA, the Fed on debit. So all this is related in a way, but it's also not related in a way. And I think this is important for us to take them one by one. And, without any particular order, let me start with CCCA, which has been a topic on this call for a little while. this topic is garnering a lot of momentum across our industry and industry participants. We are seeing a more united voice across banks and across merchants to address this point. Senators Durbin and Marshall have been very active over the last quarter since we last walked to attach this particular legislation proposal to other proposals and get a vote. They were not successful. And I think we actively used the time and productively used the time to bring across that this is not good for consumers. It is not good for small business. It is not good for merchants, particularly those who are driving large reward programs. So for all those reasons, we think this is a misguided proposal, a misguided legislation. We'll see where it goes going forward. But I have not been more optimistic on the industry pulling together to making those arguments understood than at this point. So this is CCCA. We're closely engaged on that. Now, on REG-II; so we're in compliance with that. Have we seen any particular outcome? I think it was a question on last call. Do you see this as an opportunity or as a risk? At this point, neither; what I can tell you is we will compete. We have invested billions over the years in the security of our network proposition and we think security is at the center of this whole debate. Can the merchant take away decisions from a consumer here and route this to the least cost and possibly the least secure network? Well, that is what we want to point out. That shouldn't be the case. We're leaning in on that. We haven't seen it yet at this point. So for us to just monitor and see what happens, we'll surely talk about it again next quarter. The Fed debit pricing piece that was put out yesterday is going into a consulting period. Here again, the same kind of momentum across the industry, across the American Bankers Association, the Electronic Payments Council, put out a letter to the Fed on Friday night along with seven other trades, if I recall correctly, arguing that price caps are generally driving market distortions. This is not a good thing. It's not a good thing for the consumer. Yet again, not a good thing for merchants who run reward programs and so forth. So we'll have to see where it goes. It is important, though, to point out that interchange is a balancing mechanism for the industry. It does not directly affect our P&L. So those are important things to keep in mind. For all of those, we see ourselves as an industry custodian to make sure that the arguments around safety and security and consumer choice are fully understood by all stakeholders. And as we were saying earlier, we're monitoring credit availability. Credit availability is not an issue as far as we can see. At this point, it's beyond historic level. It's below historic level. So that's something that is part of our continuing efforts to understand where the dynamics are going. Now on Asia, you answered the question on their strong rhetoric from Asia. I would probably word this differently and say we're not seeing that. We're seeing this is an argument in a broader conversation around where value is coming from, the value of globalization and global connectivity. On the other hand, things like sanctions play into this. It's a very complex mix. And across the world, not just in Asia, there's a conversation around weighing all of that off. So it's important for you to understand that we have been partnering with countries around the world for years. Just take Europe to start with. Early on, we talked about Maestro and Debit Mastercard. We're partnering with a whole range of local payment systems for years. And there are no particular concerns around that. The same is in many other parts of the world. Where this is going and going forward, we'll have yet to see. But it is understood that as part of a globally connected economy and a world where some de-risking plays into that, trusted cross-border data flows matter. People still want to travel. And all of that makes us an important player. Also keep in mind that our capabilities across network level, trusted solutions, cyber-security solutions, gets us a seat at the table. We're seen as a technology company, a global technology company, not necessarily as a U.S. payment brand when we have those conversations because we help across. We enable local payment solutions through those services. So I'm not overly worried about this, but it's an active dialogue where we are seeing some really good things coming out of that. Think about some of the advancements in financial inclusion when local governments set up systems that reach consumers that haven't been reached before. That lifts everybody's boat. And that is good for the overall payments industry. So it is a broad topic. We've been engaging through the U.S. government, through other governments, multilateral organizations. And I personally spend quite a bit of time on that topic to ensure that we don't lose the benefit of a globally connected economy. Right. So what Sachin said, he wasn't really talking about tempering in VAS. He was talking about tempering in the other solutions. So I just want to kind of get that straight out. I think there is potentially a little bit of confusion here with our revenue disaggregation and the definitions here. We've talked about services in a particular way for years, and now we have a slightly different definition, as which we shared with you. So I just want to put that out there first. To your question, so we continue to expect strong growth in value-added services and solutions, DNS and CSI, as we said. As far as expenses go, I said it at the beginning, looking at macro, looking at everything that's going on around us, and we have demonstrated this through COVID, we have demonstrated it through Russia, and we will continue to demonstrate as we have a whole range of levers in a not particularly capital-heavy business to adjust our expenses. You've seen us managing for positive bottom-line and top-line growth on a year-over-year basis. We're not managing this quarter by quarter, but that is always something that we keep in mind. So our financial discipline will continue here. We have no reason to change that. It's working well, and that is the disciplined way to do this. Thank you. Thanks, Dan. As you can appreciate, I keep a close eye on the German market very specifically, and I think there's a lot of confusion and we're not seeing that. Consumer spending remains pretty steady in Germany and generally in Europe. Sachin talked a little bit about one U.K. might have a little bit of moderation here and there, but overall we're not seeing that. So what we see on the other hand, as is strong growth for us in Europe on all the migrations, on our debit maestro migrations and so forth. So Europe's been a bright star, continues to be for us. So we don't quite relate to what others are reporting. Let me start off here. So I want to reiterate what Sachin said before. We are trying to win portfolios that are important for market relevance perspective for us to gain access to transactions to drive our services model and, follow through on that virtuous circle that I talked about earlier in my remarks. So that's the whole idea. We keep net revenue yield in mind as we do all of this. That is the integrated payments competitive landscape. Payments is competitive. There's a lot of players out on the landscape. we like competition and we feel we have a truly unique proposition between our payments and digital solutions on one hand and our services on the other hand. So when you think about Unicredit, so why did they come to us? Well, they were looking at our proven track record in our engagement with Unicredit for the expanded relationships and supporting their customers. They like our sustainability agenda. On Citizens, it was a similar kind of mix and on Webster, yet again, it was a similar kind of mix. There's always something across the portfolio of services that sticks out. Citizens, I recall a conversation on open banking, for example. That is clearly one that mattered and the sustainability agenda yet again. So it's a mix. There is nothing particularly new here. We always weigh off the volume growth that we can see with the incentives that we give to make this whole equation work for us in a very disciplined manner. We do not want to win. So we're very disciplined about that and I don't see anything out of the ordinary here, but I want to hand over to Sachin to give us a little more color on that. Right. So this is a combination of bill pay, of open banking. This is for us sitting in the new flow space. Very specifically, what we are addressing is trying to bring value to ACH flows. These are, somebody paying a doctor or things like that. And how do we add value to this is by plugging onto a flow that would take place and might not happen because of insufficient funds on an account. We're putting in our open banking connection to make it clear is there a balance on the account. It's called the payment success indicator. That is the product. And it is a per-click fee related to the API call. So that is the model. That is bringing value to a part of the payments industry where there wasn't a particular problem to be solved and not anybody willing to pay for it. I think we're starting to find these corners where there is real value that we can bring. So for us, this is TAM expansion. This is new flows. And as I said, we're bringing our unique combination of services together. We are in real-time payments and we are in digital identity and we're in open banking. All of this is needed here to make the solution work. And this is why a player like JPMorgan comes to us to do this for us. And Verizon, to the point about momentum, will now be piloting it. So it would be a little early to talk about momentum. But we'll come back on that as that solution is then rolled out into the market. But it is now live. And that was an important point for us, because it had to be built and put together and we have done that. All right. Hey, Ramsey, let me start off on that. So if you look at how our distribution has evolved over the years, the whole theme of diversification across products and segments also applies here. So we're doing a whole number of things. I talked about our work on acceptance. That is part of our distribution where contactless, tap on phone, things like that, a whole range of new merchant groups scaling these kind of technologies with partners like Stripe. Those are all going into areas that we haven't been in. Then you have other parts of our go to market. We talked about in B2B, we talked about Oracle and SAP. You go over into the world of acquirers. There's a whole range of acquirers, more traditional acquirers, which are our partners. So across the board, it's highly diversified, it's regionally highly diversified. So these blips here really talk about other people's business. But earlier on the question around what we're seeing in Europe, we're just not seeing it in our numbers because we have a highly diversified model. So whatever specific sector focus somebody has that is a partner of ours doesn't necessarily throw through for us. So I don't know if the market got it wrong or not. We're not the Oracle, but we make sure we partner with everybody to drive the overall digital ecosystem. Right. So we continue to believe in the whole notion of open banking and open data at large, where people and businesses use their own data to drive toward better services and better propositions for them. So the idea stands. And I think the idea gets hold and hold. If you look at Europe with, more regulation coming in, looking at PSD3 and so forth, you're looking at the CFPB here in the United States putting out some thoughts on how regulation could look like. For us, I put this in context of the idea is understood. How do you make it safer? What does that need? It needs trusted parties in the middle. We're in a world full of a bunch of bilateral relationships where people exchange data in a not so safe way. That would be a bad world. That's what regulators want to prohibit. We're coming in and saying we could be one of those parties that really bring the idea to life for consumers. I can use my data for better financial services. So when I look at what the CFPB has put out, we largely support the idea. It aligns very well with our data responsibility principles that we put out. It's your data, the consumer. You benefit from it. You control it. It is our role as a company to keep it safe, and we're very good at that. So our interlocking circles stand for trust. For open banking to work, you need trust. I think that is where we're going. So we're engaging. In fact, we're oftentimes in the room when these things are being thought about. In Europe, we were very much part of the dialogue on how data privacy on this context will look like. Yeah, Jason. So, look, we're not updating anything on the three-year outlook at this point in time. It's like you said, the first year actually turned out to be a very nice year. Again, in the second year, we've delivered quite strongly year to date, and then we've shared with you what we think will happen from an expectation standpoint in Q4. The one thing I just want to kind of orient everybody to is that we're in a very, very volatile time, and the world has actually changed quite meaningfully since then, which is what I'm alluding to here is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and our suspension of activities in Russia. So that's something to keep in mind. We certainly keep it in mind as part of the fact that what we were assuming at that point in time in period Russia right now, obviously we don't have revenues related to Russia, which are coming through. But beyond that, I have nothing really to share in terms of updated thoughts around our three-year outlook."

Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. So starting with the big picture. Our momentum continued into the second quarter with net revenue up 15% and operating income up 16%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, once again demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our business. Consumer spending has remained resilient with spend on experiences and travel remaining a focus. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors. First, the overall labor market remains strong, including wage growth, and consumers continue to be supported by credit and savings. These are key factors of consumer spending.  Second, the efforts of central banks to curb inflation are showing signs of progress. Despite this, inflation remains elevated, and we are in a period of tight monetary policy across many countries. Economic growth will continue to vary country by country and sector by sector. Looking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. We continue to see strength in T&E with some recent moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel continues to show strength, reaching 154% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this trend with our travel-oriented portfolios and our initiatives in areas like loyalty and marketing. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well.  We're monitoring the environment closely and are ready to adjust investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these priorities are: one, expanding in payments; two, extending our services; and three, embracing new networks. First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to win deals with a diverse set of customers, powering growth and acceptance, capturing a prioritized set of new payment flows, and exploring new ways to ensure payment choice by leveraging multiple alternatives, including card rails, ACH, blockchain and open banking. Back to the top of this list. We are winning deals across the globe through a combination of our innovative products, differentiated services and our solution-selling approach. I'll share a few examples from each region. Let's start in Europe, where we announced a significant win with UniCredit across all card products.  We expanded our partnership and put in place a first-of-its-kind, single-card, multi-market strategy spanning 13 banks, 12 markets and 20 million cards. UniCredit selected Mastercard due to our innovative digital capabilities, shared focus on sustainability and proven ability to support their client needs. In Germany, the previously announced conversion of approximately 10 million of Deutsche Bank's credit and debit cards to Mastercard has now started. These wins build on our prior success in the U.K., where there are now 16 million NatWest Debit Mastercards live in market. When combined with the Santander and First Direct migrations, approximately 27 million debit cards have now shifted to Mastercard across these 3 portfolios in the U.K. Turning to North America. Mastercard will partner with Fiserv's money network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. Up north, Coast Capital, Canada's largest Federal credit union, will be converting their consumer and small business portfolios to Mastercard. The partnership highlights our shared commitment to local communities with issuance through Collabria Financial Services.  In addition, we have a new agreement with Tim Hortons, the largest quick-service restaurant brand in Canada. Tim Hortons will launch a new Mastercard credit card and will be using a broad set of Mastercard's digital, analytics and fraud services and technologies. Our relationship with Santander in Latin America continues to grow. In Mexico, we established a long-term exclusive deal with Openbank, their new digital bank. We also renewed the Fiesta Rewards co-brand credit card, Santander's key offering within their consumer portfolio.  In Brazil, we will be Santander's exclusive partner across their commercial portfolio. And we've expanded our partnership with fast-growing Sicredi, one of Brazil's largest credit unions.  In Asia Pacific, we've extended our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, which will enable us to grow our consumer credit presence across key markets in the region. We've also expanded our partnership with HSBC through the launch of the Travel One Card in Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. Travel One will provide instant in-app rewards redemption powered by the Mastercard Rewards system. With all of these cards, people do need a place to use them. We continue to power growth and acceptance by establishing new partnerships and scaling new technologies. This quarter, we announced partnerships with both Alipay and WeChat Pay to enable international travelers to easily link any Mastercard credit or debit card to Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets. The partnership allows visitors to make payments with tens of millions of QR code merchants across China.  I just returned from China, where I saw firsthand how this is helping international travelers shop and pay in more places in a simple way. It's like paying like a local. And this will be valuable as inbound cross-border travel to China improves from approximately 50% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. In the online environment, we are scaling our Click to Pay capability to enhance the guest checkout experience. Click to Pay transactions grew over 70% year-over-year in the second quarter, and the technology is now live in 30 markets. In the quarter, we added Chile, Bahrain and Slovakia. And NatWest Group became the first bank in the U.K. to go live with Click to Pay push provisioning for cardholders. Shifting to New Payment Flows. We are making tangible progress in this area. In commercial point of sale, we've extended our partnership with Brex to support the international expansion of their commercial portfolios. We expanded our relationship with myPOS continuing to drive new merchant acceptance across more than 30 European markets while also migrating their small business debit portfolio to Mastercard. And we've established an exclusive partnership with Australian lender, Grow Finance, to introduce credit cards to their small business customers later this year. In B2B accounts payable, we remain the market leaders in virtual card. We continue to drive growth by tapping into new use cases. For example, we established an exclusive partnership with EasyTransfer in Greater China. This competitive flip leverages our virtual card capabilities to support cross-border tuition payments for international students. We're also making it easy for buyers and suppliers to integrate virtual cards into the technology platforms they already use. Building on our prior announcements with SAP and Coupa, we've recently partnered with GEP to integrate our virtual card technology into their payables platform. And on the supplier side, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager with Billtrust. The solution streamlines the processing of virtual card transactions for suppliers and automates the integration of reconciliation data into accounts receivable systems. This is a great solution. And it builds on partnerships with companies like Boost Payment Solutions, who have been working closely with Mastercard to expand and optimize commercial acceptance. And finally, in new flows, we continue to deploy our disbursement and remittances capabilities in new ways and across new geographies. In the U.S., we partner with top sports gaming processor, Interchecks, who will make Mastercard Send available to gaming operators for payouts. Careem Pay, one of the largest digital wallets in UAE, will use Send to top up their wallets using Mastercard. And on the cross-border front, we partnered with Al Fardan Exchange in Qatar to facilitate remittance services and support cross-border travel. Our work in real-time ACH continues to support these new flows. Our circular approach has been to expand our infrastructure reach into new markets. Going forward, we will be focusing on delivering and scaling in the markets we already are serving while building applications and services in these key locations, in line with our overall strategic and financial objectives. And in blockchain, we're introducing the MasterCard Multi-Token Network, MTN. MTN is a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems, more secure, scalable and interoperable. We believe in the potential of blockchain technologies. However, regulated money, such as bank deposits and CBDCs, need to be part of the solution, and they should interoperate with traditional systems. We can help with that. MTN is the natural evolution of the work we have already done in this space. The initial sandbox will kick off in the U.K. this summer. Now turning to services. Our services inform decision-making of our customers. They help them create stronger connections and greater loyalty. Payments and services reinforce each other, multiplying our impact and the value we deliver to all our partners. Our services help many -- drive many of the wins I mentioned earlier. So here are a few additional examples. We recently launched our Consumer Fraud Risk solution, which leverages our latest AI capabilities and the unique network view of real-time payments I just mentioned to help banks predict and prevent payment scams. AI is a foundational technology used across our business and has been a game changer in helping identify such fraud patterns. We've partnered with 9 U.K. banks, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Monzo and TSB to stop scam payments before funds leave a victim's account. TSB, one of the first banks to adopt the solution, indicated that it has already dramatically increased its fraud detection since deploying the capability. We're combining our loyalty, consulting, analytics and identity services in different ways to help our customers capitalize on the travel recovery. This quarter, we extended our broad-based partnership with Expedia Group. Together, we will combine Mastercard's loyalty solution with Expedia's extensive travel supply to enable Mastercard cardholders to book travel using loyalty points. We also partnered with Thomas Cook in India to issue prepaid cards for international travel. The proposition includes cardholder access to over 450 cross-border travel offers through Mastercard Travel Rewards. And earlier this month, I met with our partners at Deutsche Bank and Lufthansa in Frankfurt. We resigned our long-standing partnerships with Lufthansa Group for its Miles & More loyalty program and welcomed Deutsche Bank as the new issuing partner. In this enhanced relationship, you will see a combination of our loyalty solutions, personalization capabilities and digital user experiences help the partnership take off to the next level using airlines peak. We're also leveraging our personalization in Test & Learn capabilities to help our partners across the ecosystem enhance the customer experience and improve acquisition and conversion rates. For example, the combined Dynamic Yields personalization capabilities with our marketing services to drive digital customer acquisition for Ecobank in Nigeria. In addition, HP Inc. has partnered with us to deploy personalized bank content for their consumers across Canada and Europe. And on the merchant side, we are working with 7-Eleven in Australia using our Test & Learn capabilities to support their rollout of new store concepts and evolve its food and beverage offerings. Our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks with a focus on open banking and digital identity. We continued to make progress in open banking and established a series of new and expanded collaborations this quarter, including ones with Freddie Mac, Algon based out of France and Dapi in the UAE. These entities will leverage our smart and consumer permission data to drive increased financial inclusion and make digital interaction simpler and safer. Turning to digital identity. We're driving adoption across several new verticals, including travel, ticketing, retail and financial institutions. Travel provider, FlightHub, is using our identity solutions to help travelers book their new next adventure.  Sports teams across the U.S., including the New Jersey Devils, use these solutions to enable fans to buy tickets while reducing fraud on ticketing platforms. Major League Baseball used our NuDetect technology to ensure that All-Star votes were authentic for this year's All-Star game. In retail, we partner with IKEA, who is using Ekata to help reduce friction and fraud. And financial institutions like Greenwood, a digital banking platform for Black and Latinx communities are using our capabilities to authenticate consumers in real time, making financial empowerment a reality for more people. So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, supported by resilient consumer spending, particularly in travel and experiences. Our strong deal momentum continues with new wins and expanded relationships powered by our services across a range of partners, including UniCredit, Fiserv, Tim Hortons, Brex and many more. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy positions us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 16%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 11% and 14%, respectively, both reflecting a sizable discrete tax expense this quarter related to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil. EPS of $2.89 includes a $0.22 reduction due to the discrete tax expense I just mentioned and an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $497 million through July 24, 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 16% with credit growth of 14% and debit growth of 17%. Of note, we have now completed the NatWest debit migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 24% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q1, this is due to tougher comps as we opened up post-Omicron last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, you see continued strength. For example, cross-border travel is at 154% of 2019 levels in Q2, which is up 6 ppt from the prior quarter. On the same basis, cross-border card-not-present excluding travel continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels, up 2 ppt from the prior quarter to 210%. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 17% year-over-year in Q2. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents over 60% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the second quarter, which came in above our expectations. As a reminder, earlier this year, we revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into 2 new categories: payment network and value-added services and solutions. Now getting into the numbers described on a currency-neutral basis.  Payment network net revenue increased 15% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Payment network net revenue was higher than anticipated primarily due to higher revenues related to FX volatility and the timing of planned deal activity. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16% primarily due to the continued healthy growth of our Cyber & Intelligence solutions driven by our underlying driver growth and the demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for consulting and marketing services, which was partially offset by other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 11%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 29%, while cross-border volumes increased 24%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing assessments were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $270 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period.  Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now turning to Page 9. Let me first comment on the operating metrics trends in the second quarter. Versus 2019, overall spending has remained resilient. When viewed year-over-year on a sequential basis, we are seeing some moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets as well as more difficult comps. As it relates to the first 3 weeks of July, our metrics are holding up well, generally in line with Q2 when indexed to 2019. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from this schedule excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals continue to remain strong as overall consumer spending remains healthy and we continue to deepen our relationships with partners across the globe. Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel. For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the year. As Michael mentioned, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth. With respect to the third quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off a strong Q2, this sequentially reflects a lower anticipated contribution to growth from revenues related to FX volatility. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 ppt, and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 ppt. Other items to keep in mind. First, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $90 million for Q3. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18% and 19% for Q3 and Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business and the recent U.S. tax guidance that allows for more tax credits to be claimed related to 2022 and 2023. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Sachin. Audra, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just want to ask on the UniCredit win there. That was a nice one just outside of the top 10, it looks like, in Europe. So you mentioned a multi-market strategies what they're going after, and I heard sustainability also as a reason for the win. I'm just curious, thinking about this as a case study, is this a new trend? Why are they employing the strategy now in the wake of a lot of the macro uncertainty, open banking, and there was a lot of talk about pan-European schemes and whatnot. So I'm -- just wanted to study this a little bit and if there's any comments on timing pricing as well.\nMichael Miebach: Right. Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. So this is a fantastic win. We're excited about that. As I laid out, it's very unique. This is a pan-European bank, so cutting across 13 banks in 12 markets. It's a wide strategy. Therefore, it's single card, multi-market and it cuts across a lot of our digital capabilities. So I think the breadth of our offering on the digital-first side as well as our services are a key aspect of us winning this particular portfolio. The sustainability part, we see this across a whole range of customers who are all looking at climate as the question of the century to solve, what can be done, the consumption question in the context of payments. There's so many angles to it. Our Priceless Planet Coalition on tree planting itself plays into that. So that is particularly important to UniCredit. So here again, we had a meeting of the minds. In the end, it comes down to as part of the migration, and you alluded to this in your question, do we stand ready to serve their needs from day 1 as the migration starts. We have proven this with Deutsche Bank, we've proven it with NatWest and so forth. So this is something that is not new to us. So we're excited to see this unfold over the near future.\nOperator: We'll go next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Michael, I want to ask about FedNow, which is now finally launched. I know you've commented on this before, and it's very early days and far from any sort of ubiquity or potential retail payment use cases. But you've had also a lot of experience working alongside real-time payments rails owning some TAM. So how are you thinking about FedNow and the risk [indiscernible] involved.\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Harshita. Yes, we're all monitoring what FedNow is doing. They are now going live. So this is clearly a milestone, a good opportunity to look at this topic again. Yes, our view on this really hasn't changed. So in the end, it comes down to what problem you are trying to solve.  What are merchants looking for? Merchants are looking for reach to consumers. So scale matters. What are consumers looking for? Consumers are looking for safe ways to pay in a predictable fashion, ubiquity available. So those are all factors that haven't changed with this launch. We built that acceptance. We have a brand, the 2 interlocking circles that represent trust so that addresses a lot of what merchants and consumers are looking for. And we strengthened the position -- the proposition over years, contactless, Tap on Phone, buy now, pay later, Mastercard Installments, Click to Pay and so forth. So that's good.  The Mastercard debit proposition is strong, and we keep evolving that. So it's well understood now. FedNow is launching. So as we look at that, we will obviously continue to compete and offer our services to our banking and issuing partners. At the same time, in our experience, to your question, we have stayed close to these systems in various other countries in the end, ending up partnering with most of them. So here, we'll have to see where it goes live. Going live doesn't mean that it is broadly available yet. It is early days, as you said.  It doesn't have features. It doesn't have a consumer platform as such. You can't access it through your mobile banking app. All of that is what our solution today provides. So we have to see where it goes. Head-on competition by the mindset of partnership where and when it makes sense for us and where this goes. It is important to say that we do have solutions for these systems. If you look at the Chase Pay by Bank solution that we put into the market, so that's exactly leveraging these kind of flows that would run across these systems, generally B2B-focused. Some noncard penetration verticals run across these particular systems. So we see that as an opportunity. And Chase Pay by Bank app will be one of those ways to going after that. We've done similar kind of solutions in the U.K., in Europe and so forth. So more to come. We'll stay very close. At this point in time, I think we have a better solution in the market.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I had a question on the Fed routing rules on debit. I guess the card-not-present transactions went through in July. I'm just curious sort of how you see the opportunity there. It would seem like you're in a good position to take some share.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So the clarification came to networks available as of 1st of July. So we put that in place and we said we would, and we're ready to do that. It's still early days. We have to see where that goes. But as you rightly said, Sanjay, we stand ready to compete. And that is certainly we will look for the opportunity, and I'm sure we will find it.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathason.\nLisa Ellis: Michael, in the prepared remarks, you highlighted that with Mastercard's real-time ACH strategy, you're sort of in the phase of transitioning from building out infrastructure to focusing more on building applications and services. Just kind of taking a step back, it's always been a big differentiator for Mastercard that you own infrastructure in fast ACH with Vocalink and Nets' Corporate Services. Can you just kind of comment a bit on the movie over the last 6 or 7 years? Like how has that helped differentiate Mastercard in the -- in terms of being able to capture account-to-account network payments, new flows, et cetera?\nMichael Miebach: Thanks, Lisa. So real-time payments -- when the rise of real-time payments started 2016, '17 and so forth and we invested into Vocalink, it was clear at the time that we wanted to be in the infrastructure application services. That was a bit of the logic. At the time, we needed the street cred and we needed the talent so we can participate in this trend from day 1. That was the first season of the movie, so to say, to stick with your analogy. Where we are today, we've built out an enviable and unique position in real-time payments, having a footprint in 13 of the top 50 GDP countries where we run and partially operate real-time payment infrastructure. Our strategy was we will be in the markets that matter and we don't win to be in the markets that don't matter. So we feel we've reached that point. And now it's really to drive up scale and use that infrastructure position. The business in itself of running these systems in these markets is attractive enough. As we pointed out, we're going to focus on building out a set of applications and services on top of that. If you recall from the prepared remarks where I talked about the scam -- the anti-scam solution in the U.K. with these non-U.K. banks, it's a fantastic example of how our expertise in these markets has positioned us to rally 9 banks around the table to come up with a market-wide solution. Now not everything that we will do will be market-wide solutions. There will be individual customer solutions, but we feel we have muscle in this space. It's not going to go away. All these government payment systems out there, more and more real-time payment solutions will come up, and I think we will be in demand. And because we've done it for a long time, we'll have a seat at the table.\nOperator: We'll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Could we touch on value-added services for a moment? I mean it's been a good tailwind for some time. I think it grew just about 1 point below transactions this time around. And you mentioned strength in cyber and some other categories, offset by -- that were offsetting others. So I'd be curious to get a little more detail as to what were the strengths and weaknesses of value-added services now, including the other. And then more importantly, just how much room do you think you have across those different categories to keep that growth alive and cross-sell well into your meaningful payments business?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So let me start, and then Sachin can add a bit around the various dynamics around growth rates and so forth. So as I said in prepared remarks, payments and services complement each other. The strategy is the combination of both and we extend that into new networks. So that's the starting point. We remain convinced that, that is a key reason that all those wins I just talked about earlier are happening, so central to our strategy. Our services in aggregate continue to grow faster than the core. So we continue to diversify our revenue base. We like that. We want to continue to do that. There's a whole range of services to choose from. We could do lots of things. We have pruned our strategy when it comes to processing because we didn't feel that was such a differentiator. But we felt that cybersecurity in a world that is rapidly digitizing is just going to drive the biggest demand, and we're seeing that coming through in the numbers when I look into our C&I business, which grow at a very healthy clip. If you think about our D&S and data analytics business, here, we keep on building out the value chain. It's a vertically integrated value chain we have -- where we have Test & Learn, we have loyalty and you go all the way into personalization that is before, after, during the transaction, helping our customers run a better business. I don't see an end to the demand. In fact, that is key to our segment diversification strategy. So running at a healthy clip. I don't see any moderation here. This is -- will continue to grow. And you should see us continue to build out across the key aspects of services in cybersecurity and data analytics insight. So we love this business, and we'll continue to nourish it.\nSachin Mehra: Darrin, it's Sachin. A couple of additional thoughts. So Michael kind of covered off the strength we continue to see in our value-added services and solutions. And that's indeed the case. But you got to remember that growth rates move around quarter-to-quarter on this area. And so we should all focus on the longer-term trends out here. As it relates specifically to Q2, when you look at growth rates for value-added services and solutions in Q2 of 16%, I assume you're looking at the sequential trend out there. One point to keep in mind is that there was a 1 ppt drop in Q2 on account of acquisitions. So Q1 had the impact of acquisitions. Q2 doesn't have it because it kind of lapped that acquisition period. So that's one piece. And then specifically in my comments, I talked about that the strength in Cyber & Intelligence as well as in some of our Data & Services capabilities was offset by other solutions. And it's really all about what the growth rate trends are for Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services relative to growth rates and things like real-time ACH, especially on the infrastructure level. So when we talk about other solutions, think about it in the context of things like real-time ACH, which tend to grow at a lower pace there. So historically, what we had spoken about was just services. Now we are talking about value-added services and solutions. When we think about services in the historical context, in Q2, that services growth rate was more like 18%. So just for a reference point beyond that.\nOperator: We'll move next to Timothy Chiodo at Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: I want to dig in a little bit on another business that is important to your -- both your volume and your revenue growth algorithm over the medium term, which will be Mastercard Send. You touched a little bit on some of the cross-border use cases. I believe many of the initial use cases were much more domestic, but it's evolving over time. Maybe you could just dig in a little bit more to some of the cross-border use cases that are really gaining traction.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So Timothy, let me start off with that. So our Send business domestic and cross-border together, that's how we look at it. There's a big chunk in there, which is cross-border disbursement remittances, as you rightly said. The way that we go after that is by adding new geographies. I gave you 3 markets that we've added this year, Chile Bahrain and Slovakia. So there is tremendous reach -- unparalleled reach in what we have in our cross-border proposition, 100 countries around the world. Then there's new ways to go after it, and that is the use cases. So earlier when I was talking about gaming payout, some of that is domestic, some of that is international. The whole workers' remittances piece, Al Fardan in Qatar, those are important corridors. We very specifically go after these corridors, Middle East into South Asia and so forth. So it's pretty methodological. But there's another way that -- which I haven't talked about on how to accelerate this business, and this is how we make it easier for customers to onboard with us. So cross-border service express, which is kind of prepackaged solution around cross-border payments is another way for us to accelerate this business. So new geographies, new use cases, corridor-specific, great methodology. I think we have the right kind of assets here across our HomeSend integration, across our Transfast acquisition, the Mastercard proprietary system and our card reach. So all in, this is growing at a very healthy pace, and we like that business a lot. We are experts in cross-border, as you know, on the card side, and we're building that out here -- over here in cross-remittances and disbursements.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Rayna Kumar at UBS.\nRayna Kumar: Both of you in the past have discussed how B2B remains a large opportunity for Mastercard. Can you talk about what trends you're seeing in B2B payments in this macro environment, how you're progressing against capturing the TAM and if you're seeing any slowdown in corporate spending as companies potentially tighten their budgets?\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Rayna. I'm noticing a lot of questions coming from me means that there isn't a lot of questions in the numbers, which is fantastic. And I love to talk about B2B. Let me take the lens, Rayna, that's a little bit broader here on commercial overall. So I feel like I'm repeating myself here, but we're choosing priorities because they are growing at a healthy clip, so is the story for commercial growing at a healthy clip. So this is -- we're seeing a quarter-over-quarter, year on -- quarter 2 year-over-year growth above the consumer side. There's particular strength in our international markets business. And we've sustained elevated levels of growth when we compare this back to 2019, all the noise of COVID out of it. We have two main focuses in this area. One is commercial point of sale, and the other one is our B2B accounts payable business. Commercial point of sale, now this is a tremendous total market opportunity, massive TAM out there, and it's likely penetrated by cards today. The way we look at this is, this isn't really about building new systems. This is about penetrating with the tools that we have today, targeting SMEs and corporate T&E, purchasing fleet, all of that with our existing capabilities that we have plus our complementary solutions like smart data and easy savings and so forth. So a lot of cash and checks out there, a lot of opportunity with cards that we have today. So we leverage that. We built out a separate vertical in the company. We're focusing hard, and we're seeing the growth rewarding us for that. On the B2B side, this is accounts payable, trusted relationships, this is invoice payments and so forth. This is an even larger TAM with a lot of clear pain points. Companies are looking to automate these processes, digitize these processes, get rid of the paper. And virtual cards is a solution that works tremendously well. We -- as I called it earlier, we are the leaders in virtual cards. But the solution isn't perfect. So we invest a lot of energy through our product teams to make it better and better. What I was saying earlier on Receivables Manager, this is a way to automate the acceptance of virtual card payments, build it into the accounts receivable system, automate it to get the benefits of virtual cards without some of the manual processes that we have to go through over the past year. So this is a real breakthrough. This business is going to be hugely important for us going forward. We called it out in November 2021 at our Strategy Day. It's one of our biggest growth opportunities. We feel we're ahead in the market, and we're seeing the healthy growth. And that will be remaining a focus for us.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Good quarter guys. Michael, since you said Sachin's not getting enough questions, maybe I'll ask a numbers question.\nMichael Miebach: Yes, please.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: So I wanted to figure out sort of the cadence of operating expense. 3Q versus 4Q, it sort of looks like -- it looks like you're kind of exiting the year a little bit higher than the 3Q levels in terms of growth. So what's causing that as well as -- I know your cadence of spending tends to be longer term in nature, but are there product or service call-outs in terms of the types of investments that you're making that's most pertinent now?\nSachin Mehra: So look, what we shared with you is our thoughts around what we think operating expenses look like in the third quarter. And I've given you what the full year numbers -- or what our expectations for the full year numbers are. So I think you can kind of back into what our operating expense growth rate is going to be or is expected to be in the fourth quarter. There's nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint in Q4. Honestly, I would tell you, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis growth rates, when you back into those numbers, you'll see there's nothing really unusual going on there. Broadly speaking, on OpEx, here's what I would say. We continue to remain focused on driving our operating expenses in what matters. It's the strategic priorities. It's making sure we're channeling our capital in the appropriate manner to drive growth both in the short, medium and long term. And that's what we'll continue to do. As you know, we are a people business, to a large extent, because a lot of what we do from a tech development standpoint is around people. A lot of what we do from a sales standpoint is around people. So that's what we invest in. So when you see growth rates in terms of operating expenses, I tend to call out personnel as one of the line items essentially for that reason alone, which is the growth comes from people and people are the ones who actually bring the assets that are there for -- which allow us to deliver that revenue. But really nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint as we exit the year.\nMichael Miebach: Yes. So we keep top and bottom line growth in mind. But there is a tremendous opportunity ahead of us right now. So we are using this tailwind that we're currently seeing to continue to invest. You see the list of wins, the growth momentum in B2B, the growth momentum in services. So this is the time to continue to nourish that business and invest, and you will see us do that in a very prudent and disciplined fashion.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Dolev at Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Just a quick question on the guidance. Like obviously, results were very strong. You exceeded your second quarter guidance on revenue. Like what was the thought process of not boosting the guidance for the year?\nSachin Mehra: So Dan, a couple of thoughts here. One, again, remember, we shared guidance in terms of ranges, and that's what we've shared out here as well, right? And when you think about ranges, it -- that's what they are in essence. Point number two is some of the beat, which we had in Q2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was driven by what we call timing of deal activity. We still expect to be active in the markets. We still expect to vigorously compete in these markets. And so I kind of intentionally mentioned that as timing only because we do expect that as the year progresses, we will continue to be active in the market. So I think you should take that into consideration as well. And then my only other comment I'd make is, in Q1, we had modestly increased our thoughts relative to what we had shared right at the start of the year. So when you bring all of that together, right, that's kind of our thinking behind what we shared from a full year guidance standpoint.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bob Napoli at William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: On open banking, Mastercard has been pretty aggressive in investing in open banking. But I just like some additional thoughts on maybe on how that's progressing and then how open banking maybe fits into other strategies like embedded finance and Banking as a Service.\nMichael Miebach: All right. So open banking, as you know, we specifically called that out as 1 of 2 opportunities in new networks. The trend is here to stay. That's pretty clear. This whole notion of people got to use their data footprint to avail better financial services. There's a lot more regulation coming around that. PSD3 in Europe is coming out. So this train is -- has left the station. That's good. We're on it. The way we look at it is we have to move beyond connectivity. We had a good start. We are well connected here in the U.S. through our Finicity asset and in Europe through our Aiia assets. And we're very busy now building use cases on top of that, and this is where we think the future is going. Initial demand of Finicity was very clearly in lending-oriented use cases and asset verification use cases. That feels that is where the demand is today. To Sachin's earlier point, where do we invest, we invest where we see the demand in the near-term event. So that is where we're optimizing. But you're already starting to see as we're going beyond these lending use cases with our solutions like our Chase Pay by Bank solution here in the U.S. This is using a payment success indicator, which is using open banking data to tell a biller this is a good time when there is balance on an account, please now bill. That is what the payment success indicator does. That is powered by Mastercard's open banking technology. So near-term use case is clear. That's working. Connectivity, we're well positioned with our 2 assets, and we're very busy building out use cases. And obviously, we're excited to see Pay by Bank with Chase launch in the third quarter as we said to you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Cross-border volume growth remains very strong, but on Slide 9, clearly, there's a deceleration from April growth through June, especially in cross-border travel. So my question is for the second half, what growth rate in cross-border volume is embedded in your guidance? And then if you could go a little bit under the hood, what do you see in cross-border travel volumes? Maybe a little more texture on what you're seeing by country in Europe. You gave kind of overall data and some thoughts on China.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, David. So a couple of thoughts first. Let's start at the highest level, which is the value prop of cross-border travel still remains incredibly strong. So we've got a strong value prop. We have a strong presence in the market. As you'll remember, as we were going through COVID, when everybody had stopped traveling, we used that as an opportunity to continue to bolster our position in cross-border. And that's paying dividends right now. The fact that we were building portfolios and winning portfolios at that point in time is helping us actually drive strong growth in cross-border, broadly speaking, but also in travel. Now specifically to your question around trends, I think you're looking at year-over-year growth rates when you are looking at what the cross-border travel trajectory is month-over-month, the declines you were talking about. I'd encourage you to look at the right-hand side of Slide 9, which talks about the numbers indexed to 2019. And there, you could see actually there's an accelerating trend in cross-border travel. So said differently, you can see that in Q1, our cross-border travel as a percentage of 2019 was 148%. In Q2, that was 154%. In the first 3 weeks of July, that's 157%. The reason that's important is because the year-over-year growth rates are getting impacted by tougher comps from last year. And I think that's important to actually keep in mind. In terms of regional color, I would say that regions are performing well. Look, I mean the beauty of what we've got at Mastercard is a diversified business model. It's diversified across multiple dimensions, across payments and services, across products, across channels of sale, across regions. And the fact that we've got this presence -- strong presence across various regions helps us in the cross-border side as well. And really, what we're seeing is good, sustained growth in cross-border, both on travel as well as nontravel, across the globe. We're seeing accelerating trends in Asia Pacific, which we had very much expected and spoken about. That's what you're seeing coming through in the nature of the numbers here. We still think there are pockets of opportunity on a going-forward basis, in particular going into China and coming out of China. Just as a reference point, Michael talked about how cross-border travel inbound into China stood at approximately 50% of 2019 levels in Q2. That just goes to show what the opportunity remaining there is.  Conversely, cross-border travel outbound from China was approximately 70% in Q2. And so that -- both those numbers will give you an indication of where the opportunities lie on a going-forward basis. And as we continue to do what we're doing in terms of winning more portfolios, enriching our proposition, luring services such as our loyalty programs, that just helps us position us well on a going-forward basis. So that's the kind of color I'd like to share with you on this. Broadly speaking, I think we're in a very good place as it relates to cross-border.\nMichael Miebach: Maybe one thing to add here that is the current imbalance in the market between demand and supply. So there's still an unlock there as in airline capacity, airport capacity and all of that will unlock. So the combination of the underlying desire to travel, how that trend is coming through our position -- strong position in the travel industry with our portfolios, Expedia and Lufthansa, just to add, too, here, and this unlock of capacity over time will be a very good mix. This is an exciting space. People just want to be out there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Perlin at RBC.\nDaniel Perlin: I just wanted to maybe dig a little deeper on the commentary around this moderation in inflation and spending, Sachin, that you called out. Particularly, what can you tell us about kind of the downdraft in average tickets during the current quarter? And then maybe more specifically, are you seeing any discernible signs or indications of trade-downs from the consumer that would be high corollaries to slightly weaker consumer spending as opposed to this resiliency that it sounds like you guys are continuing to talk about?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Dan. So a couple of thoughts. I mean it's no surprise. I think you guys are all seeing that inflation, while still remaining at high levels, has started to moderate, right? So you're seeing that come through in terms of the nature of spend, right? We're a nominal value business. And at the end of the day, right, inflation -- declining inflation quarter-over-quarter will have an impact. So that was important to actually call out. And then I also talked about how there's a moderation in select markets -- international markets. The reality is when you look at markets -- and this is not broad-based, right? There are select markets where -- let's take a market like the U.K. At the end of the day, rising interest rates and high inflation levels, ultimately, will put a squeeze on people's ability to spend. That doesn't mean that the consumer isn't necessarily resilient. The consumer remains resilient on a more holistic basis. But at the margin, right, what you start to see is as, say, for example, mortgages get reset, when mortgages get reset, they're getting reset at high interest rates. What it's doing is it's squeezing the wallet -- or share of wallet, which would be available for other discretionary categories of spend. So you're going to see a little bit of that trend come through, which is what we were kind of calling out. But all of that is factored into our thinking as we think about the rest of the year and in my full year guidance. So that's really, in essence, what we were kind of thinking about. So again, I'll summarize it by saying there's recent reductions in inflation. There's a little bit of moderation in select international markets. And really, we haven't seen this as being broad-based. We haven't seen this as something which is causing concerns for us. It's very much in line with what we've been thinking about from a guidance standpoint. And I'll remind you that at the end of the day, cross-border continues to be strong, back to the question which David just asked. So to kind of bring that all together, right, we feel good about what the strength of the consumer is.\nDevin Corr: I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we'll take that question from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Sachin, just want to ask about FX volatility and how it impacts the model. I know cross-border assessment revenue growth was above volume, so it had a positive yield. I think in your peers -- one of your peers' reports, it was actually negative, and they called out the lack of FX volatility. So just trying to understand how it impacts Mastercard's model.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Bryan. So first, the -- what -- when we talk about FX volatility, you see that in our numbers in transaction processing assessments, not in cross-border assessments. It is tied to the activity about clear and settle, which is why it sits in transaction processing assessments. And what I called out was the higher growth rate in cross-border assessments relative to volume was driven by what we call favorable mix, which is the fact that our inter volumes, which is everything ex intra-Europe, right, are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe. Inter volumes tend to be high yielding than -- as compared to intra. And that's the reason you had that positive kind of gap between where revenues were on cross-border assessments and where volumes were. And again, the volatility comment I made was tied to transaction processing assessments, which is where it sits.\nDevin Corr: Thank you. Michael, any closing comments?\nMichael Miebach: All right. Thanks, Devin. The first thing I want to say, you should all know that Warren sits in the other room and is listening to us. So this is the first time soloed by Devin, and we're delighted to -- with this next chapter now. As always, I want to make a comment about all the people at Mastercard who make this happen, the 30,000 of us. I sent them a note earlier today with the results that, this is the value that you guys deliver every day. So I just wanted to share that with you. And with that, thank you for your support, your questions today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 16%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 11% and 14%, respectively, both reflecting a sizable discrete tax expense this quarter related to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil. EPS of $2.89 includes a $0.22 reduction due to the discrete tax expense I just mentioned and an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $497 million through July 24, 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 16% with credit growth of 14% and debit growth of 17%. Of note, we have now completed the NatWest debit migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 24% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q1, this is due to tougher comps as we opened up post-Omicron last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, you see continued strength. For example, cross-border travel is at 154% of 2019 levels in Q2, which is up 6 ppt from the prior quarter. On the same basis, cross-border card-not-present excluding travel continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels, up 2 ppt from the prior quarter to 210%. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 17% year-over-year in Q2. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents over 60% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the second quarter, which came in above our expectations. As a reminder, earlier this year, we revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into 2 new categories: payment network and value-added services and solutions. Now getting into the numbers described on a currency-neutral basis.  Payment network net revenue increased 15% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Payment network net revenue was higher than anticipated primarily due to higher revenues related to FX volatility and the timing of planned deal activity. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16% primarily due to the continued healthy growth of our Cyber & Intelligence solutions driven by our underlying driver growth and the demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for consulting and marketing services, which was partially offset by other solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 11%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 29%, while cross-border volumes increased 24%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing assessments were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $270 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period.  Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives. Now turning to Page 9. Let me first comment on the operating metrics trends in the second quarter. Versus 2019, overall spending has remained resilient. When viewed year-over-year on a sequential basis, we are seeing some moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets as well as more difficult comps. As it relates to the first 3 weeks of July, our metrics are holding up well, generally in line with Q2 when indexed to 2019. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from this schedule excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix. Turning to Page 10. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals continue to remain strong as overall consumer spending remains healthy and we continue to deepen our relationships with partners across the globe. Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel. For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the year. As Michael mentioned, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth. With respect to the third quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off a strong Q2, this sequentially reflects a lower anticipated contribution to growth from revenues related to FX volatility. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 ppt, and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 ppt. Other items to keep in mind. First, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $90 million for Q3. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18% and 19% for Q3 and Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business and the recent U.S. tax guidance that allows for more tax credits to be claimed related to 2022 and 2023. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Darrin, it's Sachin. A couple of additional thoughts. So Michael kind of covered off the strength we continue to see in our value-added services and solutions. And that's indeed the case. But you got to remember that growth rates move around quarter-to-quarter on this area. And so we should all focus on the longer-term trends out here. As it relates specifically to Q2, when you look at growth rates for value-added services and solutions in Q2 of 16%, I assume you're looking at the sequential trend out there. One point to keep in mind is that there was a 1 ppt drop in Q2 on account of acquisitions. So Q1 had the impact of acquisitions. Q2 doesn't have it because it kind of lapped that acquisition period. So that's one piece. And then specifically in my comments, I talked about that the strength in Cyber & Intelligence as well as in some of our Data & Services capabilities was offset by other solutions. And it's really all about what the growth rate trends are for Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services relative to growth rates and things like real-time ACH, especially on the infrastructure level. So when we talk about other solutions, think about it in the context of things like real-time ACH, which tend to grow at a lower pace there. So historically, what we had spoken about was just services. Now we are talking about value-added services and solutions. When we think about services in the historical context, in Q2, that services growth rate was more like 18%. So just for a reference point beyond that. So look, what we shared with you is our thoughts around what we think operating expenses look like in the third quarter. And I've given you what the full year numbers -- or what our expectations for the full year numbers are. So I think you can kind of back into what our operating expense growth rate is going to be or is expected to be in the fourth quarter. There's nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint in Q4. Honestly, I would tell you, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis growth rates, when you back into those numbers, you'll see there's nothing really unusual going on there. Broadly speaking, on OpEx, here's what I would say. We continue to remain focused on driving our operating expenses in what matters. It's the strategic priorities. It's making sure we're channeling our capital in the appropriate manner to drive growth both in the short, medium and long term. And that's what we'll continue to do. As you know, we are a people business, to a large extent, because a lot of what we do from a tech development standpoint is around people. A lot of what we do from a sales standpoint is around people. So that's what we invest in. So when you see growth rates in terms of operating expenses, I tend to call out personnel as one of the line items essentially for that reason alone, which is the growth comes from people and people are the ones who actually bring the assets that are there for -- which allow us to deliver that revenue. But really nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint as we exit the year. So Dan, a couple of thoughts here. One, again, remember, we shared guidance in terms of ranges, and that's what we've shared out here as well, right? And when you think about ranges, it -- that's what they are in essence. Point number two is some of the beat, which we had in Q2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was driven by what we call timing of deal activity. We still expect to be active in the markets. We still expect to vigorously compete in these markets. And so I kind of intentionally mentioned that as timing only because we do expect that as the year progresses, we will continue to be active in the market. So I think you should take that into consideration as well. And then my only other comment I'd make is, in Q1, we had modestly increased our thoughts relative to what we had shared right at the start of the year. So when you bring all of that together, right, that's kind of our thinking behind what we shared from a full year guidance standpoint. Sure, David. So a couple of thoughts first. Let's start at the highest level, which is the value prop of cross-border travel still remains incredibly strong. So we've got a strong value prop. We have a strong presence in the market. As you'll remember, as we were going through COVID, when everybody had stopped traveling, we used that as an opportunity to continue to bolster our position in cross-border. And that's paying dividends right now. The fact that we were building portfolios and winning portfolios at that point in time is helping us actually drive strong growth in cross-border, broadly speaking, but also in travel. Now specifically to your question around trends, I think you're looking at year-over-year growth rates when you are looking at what the cross-border travel trajectory is month-over-month, the declines you were talking about. I'd encourage you to look at the right-hand side of Slide 9, which talks about the numbers indexed to 2019. And there, you could see actually there's an accelerating trend in cross-border travel. So said differently, you can see that in Q1, our cross-border travel as a percentage of 2019 was 148%. In Q2, that was 154%. In the first 3 weeks of July, that's 157%. The reason that's important is because the year-over-year growth rates are getting impacted by tougher comps from last year. And I think that's important to actually keep in mind. In terms of regional color, I would say that regions are performing well. Look, I mean the beauty of what we've got at Mastercard is a diversified business model. It's diversified across multiple dimensions, across payments and services, across products, across channels of sale, across regions. And the fact that we've got this presence -- strong presence across various regions helps us in the cross-border side as well. And really, what we're seeing is good, sustained growth in cross-border, both on travel as well as nontravel, across the globe. We're seeing accelerating trends in Asia Pacific, which we had very much expected and spoken about. That's what you're seeing coming through in the nature of the numbers here. We still think there are pockets of opportunity on a going-forward basis, in particular going into China and coming out of China. Just as a reference point, Michael talked about how cross-border travel inbound into China stood at approximately 50% of 2019 levels in Q2. That just goes to show what the opportunity remaining there is.  Conversely, cross-border travel outbound from China was approximately 70% in Q2. And so that -- both those numbers will give you an indication of where the opportunities lie on a going-forward basis. And as we continue to do what we're doing in terms of winning more portfolios, enriching our proposition, luring services such as our loyalty programs, that just helps us position us well on a going-forward basis. So that's the kind of color I'd like to share with you on this. Broadly speaking, I think we're in a very good place as it relates to cross-border. Sure, Dan. So a couple of thoughts. I mean it's no surprise. I think you guys are all seeing that inflation, while still remaining at high levels, has started to moderate, right? So you're seeing that come through in terms of the nature of spend, right? We're a nominal value business. And at the end of the day, right, inflation -- declining inflation quarter-over-quarter will have an impact. So that was important to actually call out. And then I also talked about how there's a moderation in select markets -- international markets. The reality is when you look at markets -- and this is not broad-based, right? There are select markets where -- let's take a market like the U.K. At the end of the day, rising interest rates and high inflation levels, ultimately, will put a squeeze on people's ability to spend. That doesn't mean that the consumer isn't necessarily resilient. The consumer remains resilient on a more holistic basis. But at the margin, right, what you start to see is as, say, for example, mortgages get reset, when mortgages get reset, they're getting reset at high interest rates. What it's doing is it's squeezing the wallet -- or share of wallet, which would be available for other discretionary categories of spend. So you're going to see a little bit of that trend come through, which is what we were kind of calling out. But all of that is factored into our thinking as we think about the rest of the year and in my full year guidance. So that's really, in essence, what we were kind of thinking about. So again, I'll summarize it by saying there's recent reductions in inflation. There's a little bit of moderation in select international markets. And really, we haven't seen this as being broad-based. We haven't seen this as something which is causing concerns for us. It's very much in line with what we've been thinking about from a guidance standpoint. And I'll remind you that at the end of the day, cross-border continues to be strong, back to the question which David just asked. So to kind of bring that all together, right, we feel good about what the strength of the consumer is. Sure, Bryan. So first, the -- what -- when we talk about FX volatility, you see that in our numbers in transaction processing assessments, not in cross-border assessments. It is tied to the activity about clear and settle, which is why it sits in transaction processing assessments. And what I called out was the higher growth rate in cross-border assessments relative to volume was driven by what we call favorable mix, which is the fact that our inter volumes, which is everything ex intra-Europe, right, are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe. Inter volumes tend to be high yielding than -- as compared to intra. And that's the reason you had that positive kind of gap between where revenues were on cross-border assessments and where volumes were. And again, the volatility comment I made was tied to transaction processing assessments, which is where it sits. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. So starting with the big picture. Our momentum continued into the second quarter with net revenue up 15% and operating income up 16%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, once again demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our business. Consumer spending has remained resilient with spend on experiences and travel remaining a focus. On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors. First, the overall labor market remains strong, including wage growth, and consumers continue to be supported by credit and savings. These are key factors of consumer spending.  Second, the efforts of central banks to curb inflation are showing signs of progress. Despite this, inflation remains elevated, and we are in a period of tight monetary policy across many countries. Economic growth will continue to vary country by country and sector by sector. Looking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. We continue to see strength in T&E with some recent moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel continues to show strength, reaching 154% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this trend with our travel-oriented portfolios and our initiatives in areas like loyalty and marketing. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well.  We're monitoring the environment closely and are ready to adjust investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these priorities are: one, expanding in payments; two, extending our services; and three, embracing new networks. First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to win deals with a diverse set of customers, powering growth and acceptance, capturing a prioritized set of new payment flows, and exploring new ways to ensure payment choice by leveraging multiple alternatives, including card rails, ACH, blockchain and open banking. Back to the top of this list. We are winning deals across the globe through a combination of our innovative products, differentiated services and our solution-selling approach. I'll share a few examples from each region. Let's start in Europe, where we announced a significant win with UniCredit across all card products.  We expanded our partnership and put in place a first-of-its-kind, single-card, multi-market strategy spanning 13 banks, 12 markets and 20 million cards. UniCredit selected Mastercard due to our innovative digital capabilities, shared focus on sustainability and proven ability to support their client needs. In Germany, the previously announced conversion of approximately 10 million of Deutsche Bank's credit and debit cards to Mastercard has now started. These wins build on our prior success in the U.K., where there are now 16 million NatWest Debit Mastercards live in market. When combined with the Santander and First Direct migrations, approximately 27 million debit cards have now shifted to Mastercard across these 3 portfolios in the U.K. Turning to North America. Mastercard will partner with Fiserv's money network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. Up north, Coast Capital, Canada's largest Federal credit union, will be converting their consumer and small business portfolios to Mastercard. The partnership highlights our shared commitment to local communities with issuance through Collabria Financial Services.  In addition, we have a new agreement with Tim Hortons, the largest quick-service restaurant brand in Canada. Tim Hortons will launch a new Mastercard credit card and will be using a broad set of Mastercard's digital, analytics and fraud services and technologies. Our relationship with Santander in Latin America continues to grow. In Mexico, we established a long-term exclusive deal with Openbank, their new digital bank. We also renewed the Fiesta Rewards co-brand credit card, Santander's key offering within their consumer portfolio.  In Brazil, we will be Santander's exclusive partner across their commercial portfolio. And we've expanded our partnership with fast-growing Sicredi, one of Brazil's largest credit unions.  In Asia Pacific, we've extended our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, which will enable us to grow our consumer credit presence across key markets in the region. We've also expanded our partnership with HSBC through the launch of the Travel One Card in Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. Travel One will provide instant in-app rewards redemption powered by the Mastercard Rewards system. With all of these cards, people do need a place to use them. We continue to power growth and acceptance by establishing new partnerships and scaling new technologies. This quarter, we announced partnerships with both Alipay and WeChat Pay to enable international travelers to easily link any Mastercard credit or debit card to Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets. The partnership allows visitors to make payments with tens of millions of QR code merchants across China.  I just returned from China, where I saw firsthand how this is helping international travelers shop and pay in more places in a simple way. It's like paying like a local. And this will be valuable as inbound cross-border travel to China improves from approximately 50% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. In the online environment, we are scaling our Click to Pay capability to enhance the guest checkout experience. Click to Pay transactions grew over 70% year-over-year in the second quarter, and the technology is now live in 30 markets. In the quarter, we added Chile, Bahrain and Slovakia. And NatWest Group became the first bank in the U.K. to go live with Click to Pay push provisioning for cardholders. Shifting to New Payment Flows. We are making tangible progress in this area. In commercial point of sale, we've extended our partnership with Brex to support the international expansion of their commercial portfolios. We expanded our relationship with myPOS continuing to drive new merchant acceptance across more than 30 European markets while also migrating their small business debit portfolio to Mastercard. And we've established an exclusive partnership with Australian lender, Grow Finance, to introduce credit cards to their small business customers later this year. In B2B accounts payable, we remain the market leaders in virtual card. We continue to drive growth by tapping into new use cases. For example, we established an exclusive partnership with EasyTransfer in Greater China. This competitive flip leverages our virtual card capabilities to support cross-border tuition payments for international students. We're also making it easy for buyers and suppliers to integrate virtual cards into the technology platforms they already use. Building on our prior announcements with SAP and Coupa, we've recently partnered with GEP to integrate our virtual card technology into their payables platform. And on the supplier side, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager with Billtrust. The solution streamlines the processing of virtual card transactions for suppliers and automates the integration of reconciliation data into accounts receivable systems. This is a great solution. And it builds on partnerships with companies like Boost Payment Solutions, who have been working closely with Mastercard to expand and optimize commercial acceptance. And finally, in new flows, we continue to deploy our disbursement and remittances capabilities in new ways and across new geographies. In the U.S., we partner with top sports gaming processor, Interchecks, who will make Mastercard Send available to gaming operators for payouts. Careem Pay, one of the largest digital wallets in UAE, will use Send to top up their wallets using Mastercard. And on the cross-border front, we partnered with Al Fardan Exchange in Qatar to facilitate remittance services and support cross-border travel. Our work in real-time ACH continues to support these new flows. Our circular approach has been to expand our infrastructure reach into new markets. Going forward, we will be focusing on delivering and scaling in the markets we already are serving while building applications and services in these key locations, in line with our overall strategic and financial objectives. And in blockchain, we're introducing the MasterCard Multi-Token Network, MTN. MTN is a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems, more secure, scalable and interoperable. We believe in the potential of blockchain technologies. However, regulated money, such as bank deposits and CBDCs, need to be part of the solution, and they should interoperate with traditional systems. We can help with that. MTN is the natural evolution of the work we have already done in this space. The initial sandbox will kick off in the U.K. this summer. Now turning to services. Our services inform decision-making of our customers. They help them create stronger connections and greater loyalty. Payments and services reinforce each other, multiplying our impact and the value we deliver to all our partners. Our services help many -- drive many of the wins I mentioned earlier. So here are a few additional examples. We recently launched our Consumer Fraud Risk solution, which leverages our latest AI capabilities and the unique network view of real-time payments I just mentioned to help banks predict and prevent payment scams. AI is a foundational technology used across our business and has been a game changer in helping identify such fraud patterns. We've partnered with 9 U.K. banks, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Monzo and TSB to stop scam payments before funds leave a victim's account. TSB, one of the first banks to adopt the solution, indicated that it has already dramatically increased its fraud detection since deploying the capability. We're combining our loyalty, consulting, analytics and identity services in different ways to help our customers capitalize on the travel recovery. This quarter, we extended our broad-based partnership with Expedia Group. Together, we will combine Mastercard's loyalty solution with Expedia's extensive travel supply to enable Mastercard cardholders to book travel using loyalty points. We also partnered with Thomas Cook in India to issue prepaid cards for international travel. The proposition includes cardholder access to over 450 cross-border travel offers through Mastercard Travel Rewards. And earlier this month, I met with our partners at Deutsche Bank and Lufthansa in Frankfurt. We resigned our long-standing partnerships with Lufthansa Group for its Miles & More loyalty program and welcomed Deutsche Bank as the new issuing partner. In this enhanced relationship, you will see a combination of our loyalty solutions, personalization capabilities and digital user experiences help the partnership take off to the next level using airlines peak. We're also leveraging our personalization in Test & Learn capabilities to help our partners across the ecosystem enhance the customer experience and improve acquisition and conversion rates. For example, the combined Dynamic Yields personalization capabilities with our marketing services to drive digital customer acquisition for Ecobank in Nigeria. In addition, HP Inc. has partnered with us to deploy personalized bank content for their consumers across Canada and Europe. And on the merchant side, we are working with 7-Eleven in Australia using our Test & Learn capabilities to support their rollout of new store concepts and evolve its food and beverage offerings. Our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks with a focus on open banking and digital identity. We continued to make progress in open banking and established a series of new and expanded collaborations this quarter, including ones with Freddie Mac, Algon based out of France and Dapi in the UAE. These entities will leverage our smart and consumer permission data to drive increased financial inclusion and make digital interaction simpler and safer. Turning to digital identity. We're driving adoption across several new verticals, including travel, ticketing, retail and financial institutions. Travel provider, FlightHub, is using our identity solutions to help travelers book their new next adventure.  Sports teams across the U.S., including the New Jersey Devils, use these solutions to enable fans to buy tickets while reducing fraud on ticketing platforms. Major League Baseball used our NuDetect technology to ensure that All-Star votes were authentic for this year's All-Star game. In retail, we partner with IKEA, who is using Ekata to help reduce friction and fraud. And financial institutions like Greenwood, a digital banking platform for Black and Latinx communities are using our capabilities to authenticate consumers in real time, making financial empowerment a reality for more people. So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, supported by resilient consumer spending, particularly in travel and experiences. Our strong deal momentum continues with new wins and expanded relationships powered by our services across a range of partners, including UniCredit, Fiserv, Tim Hortons, Brex and many more. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy positions us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. Sachin, over to you. Right. Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. So this is a fantastic win. We're excited about that. As I laid out, it's very unique. This is a pan-European bank, so cutting across 13 banks in 12 markets. It's a wide strategy. Therefore, it's single card, multi-market and it cuts across a lot of our digital capabilities. So I think the breadth of our offering on the digital-first side as well as our services are a key aspect of us winning this particular portfolio. The sustainability part, we see this across a whole range of customers who are all looking at climate as the question of the century to solve, what can be done, the consumption question in the context of payments. There's so many angles to it. Our Priceless Planet Coalition on tree planting itself plays into that. So that is particularly important to UniCredit. So here again, we had a meeting of the minds. In the end, it comes down to as part of the migration, and you alluded to this in your question, do we stand ready to serve their needs from day 1 as the migration starts. We have proven this with Deutsche Bank, we've proven it with NatWest and so forth. So this is something that is not new to us. So we're excited to see this unfold over the near future. Thanks, Harshita. Yes, we're all monitoring what FedNow is doing. They are now going live. So this is clearly a milestone, a good opportunity to look at this topic again. Yes, our view on this really hasn't changed. So in the end, it comes down to what problem you are trying to solve.  What are merchants looking for? Merchants are looking for reach to consumers. So scale matters. What are consumers looking for? Consumers are looking for safe ways to pay in a predictable fashion, ubiquity available. So those are all factors that haven't changed with this launch. We built that acceptance. We have a brand, the 2 interlocking circles that represent trust so that addresses a lot of what merchants and consumers are looking for. And we strengthened the position -- the proposition over years, contactless, Tap on Phone, buy now, pay later, Mastercard Installments, Click to Pay and so forth. So that's good.  The Mastercard debit proposition is strong, and we keep evolving that. So it's well understood now. FedNow is launching. So as we look at that, we will obviously continue to compete and offer our services to our banking and issuing partners. At the same time, in our experience, to your question, we have stayed close to these systems in various other countries in the end, ending up partnering with most of them. So here, we'll have to see where it goes live. Going live doesn't mean that it is broadly available yet. It is early days, as you said.  It doesn't have features. It doesn't have a consumer platform as such. You can't access it through your mobile banking app. All of that is what our solution today provides. So we have to see where it goes. Head-on competition by the mindset of partnership where and when it makes sense for us and where this goes. It is important to say that we do have solutions for these systems. If you look at the Chase Pay by Bank solution that we put into the market, so that's exactly leveraging these kind of flows that would run across these systems, generally B2B-focused. Some noncard penetration verticals run across these particular systems. So we see that as an opportunity. And Chase Pay by Bank app will be one of those ways to going after that. We've done similar kind of solutions in the U.K., in Europe and so forth. So more to come. We'll stay very close. At this point in time, I think we have a better solution in the market. Right. So the clarification came to networks available as of 1st of July. So we put that in place and we said we would, and we're ready to do that. It's still early days. We have to see where that goes. But as you rightly said, Sanjay, we stand ready to compete. And that is certainly we will look for the opportunity, and I'm sure we will find it. Thanks, Lisa. So real-time payments -- when the rise of real-time payments started 2016, '17 and so forth and we invested into Vocalink, it was clear at the time that we wanted to be in the infrastructure application services. That was a bit of the logic. At the time, we needed the street cred and we needed the talent so we can participate in this trend from day 1. That was the first season of the movie, so to say, to stick with your analogy. Where we are today, we've built out an enviable and unique position in real-time payments, having a footprint in 13 of the top 50 GDP countries where we run and partially operate real-time payment infrastructure. Our strategy was we will be in the markets that matter and we don't win to be in the markets that don't matter. So we feel we've reached that point. And now it's really to drive up scale and use that infrastructure position. The business in itself of running these systems in these markets is attractive enough. As we pointed out, we're going to focus on building out a set of applications and services on top of that. If you recall from the prepared remarks where I talked about the scam -- the anti-scam solution in the U.K. with these non-U.K. banks, it's a fantastic example of how our expertise in these markets has positioned us to rally 9 banks around the table to come up with a market-wide solution. Now not everything that we will do will be market-wide solutions. There will be individual customer solutions, but we feel we have muscle in this space. It's not going to go away. All these government payment systems out there, more and more real-time payment solutions will come up, and I think we will be in demand. And because we've done it for a long time, we'll have a seat at the table. Right. So let me start, and then Sachin can add a bit around the various dynamics around growth rates and so forth. So as I said in prepared remarks, payments and services complement each other. The strategy is the combination of both and we extend that into new networks. So that's the starting point. We remain convinced that, that is a key reason that all those wins I just talked about earlier are happening, so central to our strategy. Our services in aggregate continue to grow faster than the core. So we continue to diversify our revenue base. We like that. We want to continue to do that. There's a whole range of services to choose from. We could do lots of things. We have pruned our strategy when it comes to processing because we didn't feel that was such a differentiator. But we felt that cybersecurity in a world that is rapidly digitizing is just going to drive the biggest demand, and we're seeing that coming through in the numbers when I look into our C&I business, which grow at a very healthy clip. If you think about our D&S and data analytics business, here, we keep on building out the value chain. It's a vertically integrated value chain we have -- where we have Test & Learn, we have loyalty and you go all the way into personalization that is before, after, during the transaction, helping our customers run a better business. I don't see an end to the demand. In fact, that is key to our segment diversification strategy. So running at a healthy clip. I don't see any moderation here. This is -- will continue to grow. And you should see us continue to build out across the key aspects of services in cybersecurity and data analytics insight. So we love this business, and we'll continue to nourish it. Right. So Timothy, let me start off with that. So our Send business domestic and cross-border together, that's how we look at it. There's a big chunk in there, which is cross-border disbursement remittances, as you rightly said. The way that we go after that is by adding new geographies. I gave you 3 markets that we've added this year, Chile Bahrain and Slovakia. So there is tremendous reach -- unparalleled reach in what we have in our cross-border proposition, 100 countries around the world. Then there's new ways to go after it, and that is the use cases. So earlier when I was talking about gaming payout, some of that is domestic, some of that is international. The whole workers' remittances piece, Al Fardan in Qatar, those are important corridors. We very specifically go after these corridors, Middle East into South Asia and so forth. So it's pretty methodological. But there's another way that -- which I haven't talked about on how to accelerate this business, and this is how we make it easier for customers to onboard with us. So cross-border service express, which is kind of prepackaged solution around cross-border payments is another way for us to accelerate this business. So new geographies, new use cases, corridor-specific, great methodology. I think we have the right kind of assets here across our HomeSend integration, across our Transfast acquisition, the Mastercard proprietary system and our card reach. So all in, this is growing at a very healthy pace, and we like that business a lot. We are experts in cross-border, as you know, on the card side, and we're building that out here -- over here in cross-remittances and disbursements. Thank you, Rayna. I'm noticing a lot of questions coming from me means that there isn't a lot of questions in the numbers, which is fantastic. And I love to talk about B2B. Let me take the lens, Rayna, that's a little bit broader here on commercial overall. So I feel like I'm repeating myself here, but we're choosing priorities because they are growing at a healthy clip, so is the story for commercial growing at a healthy clip. So this is -- we're seeing a quarter-over-quarter, year on -- quarter 2 year-over-year growth above the consumer side. There's particular strength in our international markets business. And we've sustained elevated levels of growth when we compare this back to 2019, all the noise of COVID out of it. We have two main focuses in this area. One is commercial point of sale, and the other one is our B2B accounts payable business. Commercial point of sale, now this is a tremendous total market opportunity, massive TAM out there, and it's likely penetrated by cards today. The way we look at this is, this isn't really about building new systems. This is about penetrating with the tools that we have today, targeting SMEs and corporate T&E, purchasing fleet, all of that with our existing capabilities that we have plus our complementary solutions like smart data and easy savings and so forth. So a lot of cash and checks out there, a lot of opportunity with cards that we have today. So we leverage that. We built out a separate vertical in the company. We're focusing hard, and we're seeing the growth rewarding us for that. On the B2B side, this is accounts payable, trusted relationships, this is invoice payments and so forth. This is an even larger TAM with a lot of clear pain points. Companies are looking to automate these processes, digitize these processes, get rid of the paper. And virtual cards is a solution that works tremendously well. We -- as I called it earlier, we are the leaders in virtual cards. But the solution isn't perfect. So we invest a lot of energy through our product teams to make it better and better. What I was saying earlier on Receivables Manager, this is a way to automate the acceptance of virtual card payments, build it into the accounts receivable system, automate it to get the benefits of virtual cards without some of the manual processes that we have to go through over the past year. So this is a real breakthrough. This business is going to be hugely important for us going forward. We called it out in November 2021 at our Strategy Day. It's one of our biggest growth opportunities. We feel we're ahead in the market, and we're seeing the healthy growth. And that will be remaining a focus for us. Yes, please. Yes. So we keep top and bottom line growth in mind. But there is a tremendous opportunity ahead of us right now. So we are using this tailwind that we're currently seeing to continue to invest. You see the list of wins, the growth momentum in B2B, the growth momentum in services. So this is the time to continue to nourish that business and invest, and you will see us do that in a very prudent and disciplined fashion. All right. So open banking, as you know, we specifically called that out as 1 of 2 opportunities in new networks. The trend is here to stay. That's pretty clear. This whole notion of people got to use their data footprint to avail better financial services. There's a lot more regulation coming around that. PSD3 in Europe is coming out. So this train is -- has left the station. That's good. We're on it. The way we look at it is we have to move beyond connectivity. We had a good start. We are well connected here in the U.S. through our Finicity asset and in Europe through our Aiia assets. And we're very busy now building use cases on top of that, and this is where we think the future is going. Initial demand of Finicity was very clearly in lending-oriented use cases and asset verification use cases. That feels that is where the demand is today. To Sachin's earlier point, where do we invest, we invest where we see the demand in the near-term event. So that is where we're optimizing. But you're already starting to see as we're going beyond these lending use cases with our solutions like our Chase Pay by Bank solution here in the U.S. This is using a payment success indicator, which is using open banking data to tell a biller this is a good time when there is balance on an account, please now bill. That is what the payment success indicator does. That is powered by Mastercard's open banking technology. So near-term use case is clear. That's working. Connectivity, we're well positioned with our 2 assets, and we're very busy building out use cases. And obviously, we're excited to see Pay by Bank with Chase launch in the third quarter as we said to you. Maybe one thing to add here that is the current imbalance in the market between demand and supply. So there's still an unlock there as in airline capacity, airport capacity and all of that will unlock. So the combination of the underlying desire to travel, how that trend is coming through our position -- strong position in the travel industry with our portfolios, Expedia and Lufthansa, just to add, too, here, and this unlock of capacity over time will be a very good mix. This is an exciting space. People just want to be out there. All right. Thanks, Devin. The first thing I want to say, you should all know that Warren sits in the other room and is listening to us. So this is the first time soloed by Devin, and we're delighted to -- with this next chapter now. As always, I want to make a comment about all the people at Mastercard who make this happen, the 30,000 of us. I sent them a note earlier today with the results that, this is the value that you guys deliver every day. So I just wanted to share that with you. And with that, thank you for your support, your questions today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

Another quarter, let's jump right in. The headline is that in quarter one, consumer spending has remained remarkably resilient in that despite continued economic uncertainty. We kicked off the year with strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter one adjusted net revenues were up 15% and adjusted operating income was up 17%, both versus a year ago, and as always on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis excluding special items.  Focusing on the macro for a moment. Let's take stock of the positive and negative factors we have been monitoring. First, the labor market in aggregate remains strong by savings remain above historical levels and consumers continue to access credit, which all are key drivers of consumer spending.  Second, central banks continue to combat elevated inflation levels with higher interest rates. Although we are seeing signs of inflation, putting additional stresses on the banking sector have emerged. We will continue to monitor how banks respond to these evolving conditions.  And finally, economic growth around the globe continues to vary by country and sector. The reopening of China is a positive catalyst. However, the impact of monetary and fiscal tightening in many countries will likely be with us for some time. So overall, many moving pieces but even so consumer spending levels have remained resilience while the mix of spending has continued to rebalance towards experiences. Looking at our switched volume trends, domestic volume growth has remained relatively stable with some recent moderation in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds. Cross-border travel in quarter one reached 148% of 2019 levels with all regions above 2019 levels. This includes notable improvement in Asia cross-border card not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. We will continue to watch the environment closely. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we are prepared to adjust investment levels appropriately while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. And as a reminder, these three priorities are expanding and payments, extending our services and embracing new networks.  Now I've been on the road for much of the quarter meeting with customers, partners, government leaders, and of course, our teams. These conversations reinforced the energy we have for our collaborative approach, and show the importance that many plays on digital payments and driving much of today's economic activity. And it's with that in mind that I'll share some examples of how we are progressing against our three strategic priorities.  First, we're expanding in payments by winning deals across a diverse set of customers innovating in and growing acceptance, and expanding solutions to address new payment flows. We see our partnership deepening with a diverse set of co-brand partners, financial institutions and fast growing fintechs around the world. This quarter we had a significant win with Costco Wholesale in Taiwan, the largest co-brand portfolio in the market. The deal is a competitive flip that ensures exclusive co-brand issuance and exclusive acceptance of Mastercard, co-brand cards and stores effectives in August this year.  We also announced our exclusive partnership with Wells Fargo and Choice Hotels, to launch their new credit card program in the United States. In the Middle East, we inked a renewal with National Bank of Egypt, the largest issuer in the country. And on the fintech front, we renewed our deal with N26, one of the largest new banks in Europe, for Mastercard to be the exclusive provider for issuing and processing services.  And in Latin America, we've expanded our relationship with Ual\u00e1, one of the fastest growing fintechs in the region, to be the exclusive network of prepaid debit and credit. So we are continuing on our trajectory delivering another solid quarter of new and renewed wins, an important element of our growth algorithm. Beyond new wins, we are driving growth in payments through the development of innovative solutions, like our instalment offerings. In Australia, we're scaling our solutions with some of the largest banks in the market, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac. Providing the way to pay is central to what we do, so to is making sure people and businesses can use those payment tools whenever they want. Along those lines, we are continuing to drive growth in acceptance, expanding connectivity and trust across all forms of card payments. Our acceptance footprint has now surpassed 100 million locations effectively doubling over the past five years. And that's just the start. Our innovative contactless, cloud commerce and click to pay solutions give more merchants the ability to accept electronic payments with simple technology connectivity. To us that's an opportunity to bring more physical and digital transactions onto our network. Over 100 markets have now reached at least 50% contactless penetration double the number three years ago. Contactless drives higher consumer engagement and helps to accelerate the secular shift to digital payments by accessing lower ticket size purchases that have historically been cash based. In quarter one, our tokenization capability was selected as part of a mobile payments launches in South Korea, and even a significant number of private label cards for contactless and thereby giving us the opportunity to deliver services on those transactions. We continue to see momentum in tap on phone, with programs across more than 70 markets globally. We continue to scale, including the Stripe announced in quarter 1 that they have enabled tap-to-pay on Android in multiple markets. In addition to helping our partners bring tap-on-phone to market, our cloud commerce acceptance technology is now live in Europe. Our cloud commerce capabilities make it easier and tricker for businesses of all sizes to accept payments on virtually any device. And click-to-pay is now live in nearly 30 markets globally, including key markets such as Australia, Brazil, U.K. and U.S. We are partnering with payment service providers like Mexico and Italy to further expand our presence. This is all complemented by our workers' partners to grow acceptance by integrating the payment experience where their customers are. You see that in the social commerce space with what's happened in Brazil, enabling consumers to make purchases directly from small businesses right within a chat. Further, we remain focused on expanding our set of new payment capabilities to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. I'll highlight a couple of areas we are targeting, starting with commercial. We had a strong growth in the space with volumes across our commercial credit and debit products in quarter 1, up 21% versus the prior year on a local currency basis. We see substantial opportunity to grow in commercial, particularly with our virtual card and small business solutions. With virtual cards where we are the market leader, one of our initiatives is to integrate our solutions with leading B2B technology platforms. This quarter, we signed a partnership agreement with Coupa to enhance their Coupa Pay solution, which embeds virtual cards to address accounts payable flows. On a small business front, today, only a small fraction of payments are captured on card. We are enhancing the value propositions from programs like Easy Savings, which offers automatic merchant-funded rebates to nearly 40 million enrolled cardholders in over 80 countries. And we are growing by establishing new issuance deals through partners like Galileo in the United States, the Mastercard will be the preferred brand for small business and commercial programs. Now beyond commercial, disbursement and remittances flows represent a significant opportunity for growth through geographic expansion, new distribution partners and an expanding set of use cases. In terms of new markets, our gaming use case is now live in Canada and Peru, and we have added cross-border origination to the UAE and Uzbekistan. By connecting with MFS Africa, a leading digital payment company, we have enabled mobile payouts across 10 markets in Africa. We are working with distribution partners like checkout.com to increase reach to even more customers in Asia and the United States. And we're enabling our cross-border services solutions to small and midsized banks through cross-border services express with this simple-to-use digital-first solution, participating financial institutions can offer their customers the ability to send money or pay vendors across the globe quickly and securely. In terms of expanding use cases, we have enabled cash in U.S., in Europe and the U.K., facilitating underbanked customers to safely load cash into their accounts from a nonbank location, which can also help drive follow-on card spend. So as you can see, we continue to make broad-based progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows. Turning now to services. We love services, where we are focused on growth and resiliency through scaling our existing solutions and adding new capabilities. As merchants as consumers shift to digital, our comprehensive set of cybersecurity solutions becomes even more critical. For instance, risk recon helps an enterprise identify their own cybersecurity vulnerabilities as well as for their ecosystem partners. With our acquisition Baffin Bay Networks this quarter, we now have a solution to help these customers act on this information. Specifically, Baffin Bay's AI enabled cloud based threat protection helps to stop cyber attacks related to malware, ransomware, and DDoS attacks. The acquisition also complements our other cyber offerings, including our simulation and assessment tools, as well as our cybersecurity consulting practice.  You all are familiar with our comprehensive set of data analytics, marketing, and loyalty assets. These are about helping our partners make smarter decisions to drive better outcomes. For example, Agoda, one of the world's fastest growing online travel platforms in Asia, is leveraging our economic insights to inform their strategic planning. To meet among such, the largest electronics retailer in Europe, is utilizing our test and learn capabilities to support the assessment and optimization of new business initiatives.  We also continue to make progress signing deals with retailers and commerce partners, like Hyundai Motors, Europe, and Puma, to utilize our recently acquired personalization platforms Dynamic Yield. We continue to look for ways to combine all these assets to deliver valuable end to end solutions. We just announced elements a suite of applications which brings insights for Mastercards data analytics to enrich dynamic yields personalization experience.  Our third key priority area is embracing new networks where we are making progress in the areas of open banking and digital identity. In open banking, we continue to work with a broad set of banks and fintechs who are interested in its potential across a wide range of use cases. In addition to the Pay-by-Bank solution for JP Morgan that we announced last quarter, we are working with payment risk and identification company GIACT, member of the London Exchange to embed a secure account verification solution.  Also, Saxo Bank will use our open banking technology for account opening and top ups in Europe. Further, we're developing capabilities on top of our open banking platform, we have advanced analytics partner with Fintech, innovators like [indiscernible] Nath, enigma and Gen Equity to expand access to capital, with better data for making lending decisions.  This is another great example of how our technology supports small business. Moving next to digital identity. We continue to see strong adoption of our intelligent identity solutions powered by machine learning. This quarter, we secured a key partnership with Southwest to embed our intelligent identity solutions from content to reduce fraud and friction in digital interactions.  Still early stages with open banking and digital identity, but we are making progress scaling our technology to new markets and use cases with notable partners. So with that, I'll wrap it up and in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, reflecting a resilient consumer and the continued recovery of cross border travel. We will continue to watch the environment closely and are prepared to act as circumstances dictate. We see a significant opportunity ahead having now surpassed 100 million acceptance locations worldwide. And our focus strategy, diversified and resilient business model and strong relationships around the globe position as well through economic cycles.  Sachin over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page three, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items, and the impact of gains and losses on equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross border travel. Operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt increase on acquisitions.  Operating income was up 17% which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 2%, which includes the 1 ppt decrease in two acquisitions, EPS was up 4% year over year to $2.80, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. Of note, the respective growth rates of net income and EPS were negatively impacted by a low tax rate in 2022 as a result of sizeable discrete tax benefits last year. During the quarter we repurchase 2.9 billion worth of stock, and an additional 602 million through April 24 2023. So now let's turn to Page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 15% year over year on a local currency basis.  On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 16%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 9%, with credit growth of 15% reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 3%, excluding the impact of the roll off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 6%. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 18% with credit growth of 17% and debit growth of 19%.  Cross border volume was up 35% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel related cross border spending.  Turning to Page five, Switched transactions grew 12% year over year in Q1. Excluding Russia from the prior year, the switched transactions grew 20% year over year in Q1. Both card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents over 58% of all in person switched purchase transaction. In addition, card growth was 9%, globally there are 3.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning so Slide six, for a look into our net revenues for the first quarter, which were above our expectations. As a reminder, we recently revised that disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into two new categories, payment network and value added services and solutions.  Now getting into the numbers described on a currency neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, which would have been 1 ppt higher if we excluded the Russia related special item which benefitted Q1 2022. The growth in payment network was primarily driven by domestic and cross border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives.  Value added services and solutions net revenue increased 21%, including a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. The growth was primarily driven by the continued strong growth of our cyber and intelligence solutions driven by underlying driver growth, higher demand for our fraud solutions, as well as the scaling of our identity and authentication solutions. And we saw healthy demand for our data analytics, consulting and marketing services, as well as our loyalty solutions.  Now let's turn to Page seven, starting with key metrics related to payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 15%. The difference is primarily driven by mix and the underreporting of volumes from sanctioned customers in Russia last year, which accounted for approximately 2 ppt of the variance. Cross-border assessments increased 39%, while cross-border volumes increased 35%. The both PPT difference is primarily due to favourable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.  Transaction processing assessments were up 14%, while switch transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to FX-related revenues. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $212 million this quarter. It's important to note that these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving now to Page eight. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.  Operating expenses were higher than expected in part due to personnel costs to support higher-than-expected revenue as well as unfavourable foreign exchange related due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Turning to Page nine. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of April. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in April. As expected, the year-over-year growth rates are being impacted by 2 opposing factors: one, more difficult comps as we began lapping the effects of Omicron; and two, the lapping of the drag created by the suspension of our operations in Russia in March of last year. To aid in your understanding of the underlying spending trends and eliminate some of the noise induced by the lapping effects, we have also included the metric Index 2019 levels on the slide. Let's discuss each of the metrics in turn.  Starting with switched volumes. Through the first three weeks ago, we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 ppt versus Q1. This reflects more difficult comps and some modest slowing in the U.S. due to lower tax refunds. This started in March and continued into April. This is partially offset by a 3 ppt benefit from the lapping of Russia. Switch transactions grew 18% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of April, up 6 ppt versus Q1. This includes an 8 ppt benefit from the lapping of the suspension of operations in Russia. As a reminder, Russia had a relatively low average ticket size, which results in a larger relative impact to this metric. In terms of cross-border, volumes grew 29% on a year-over-year basis, down 6 ppt from Q1. This reflects the continued recovery in cross-border travel as well as the positive impact of lapping the suspension of our Russian operations, but is more than offset by a tougher year ago comp as travel surged after the passage of Omicron last year. Cross-border volume is indexing at 171% of 2019 levels in April, up from 168% in Q1. To further assist your understanding of the trends in the business ex Russia, where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix to show all data points from the schedule if you exclude activity from Russian issued cards from current and prior periods. Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified business model and our momentum with our customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. Consumer spending overall remains healthy, albeit with some recent moderation in domestic spending in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds this year. At the same time, as Michael noted, the recovery in cross-border travel continues with inbound travel to all regions now well above 2019 levels. Within Asia, in Q1, China outbound cross-border travel increased to approximately 65% of Q1 2019 levels, while inbound reached 45% on the same basis. As a reminder, China made up 2% of outbound and 1% of inbound cross-border travel in 2019. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario assumes consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover. For the year, our outlook has improved modestly, reflecting our stronger-than-expected performance in Q1. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to be at a low teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact for the year. Again, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth. With respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate again on a continual basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off of a strong Q1, this sequentially reflects a tougher year ago comp, lower anticipated FX volatility, partially offset by lapping the suspension of operations in Russia. Foreign exchange and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 growth to be at the high end of a low double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This includes cost of approximately 2 ppt associated with the wind down of our efforts related to the P27 project, given their decision to withdraw their license application in the Nordics. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt. Other items to keep in mind, first, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $100 million for Q2 given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels, which includes a sequential increase due to our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18.5% and 19% for both Q2 and the full year based on the current geographic mix of our business. Before I turn the call back over to Warren to begin the Q&A session, I wanted to express my deep gratitude to Warren for the thought leadership, dedication and friendship he has demonstrated over his last 6-plus years at Mastercard. As previously announced, Warren will be handing over the head of IR role to Devon Core effective May 1, and will be with us through your end in an advisory capacity. Thank you, Warren and over to you for the Q&A session.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thank you, Sachin. I have to say it's been a distinct pleasure. With that, let's turn it over to questions. Audra, we're ready to go. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Warren, you will be missed, of course. I just had a question about Fed Now coming in July. Of course, VocaLink has been involved in the clearinghouses RTP network. Can you just kind of give your perspective on how you expect the rollout of Fed Now to affect Mastercard's business in the U.S. positively or potential pressures? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Good morning, Lisa, thanks for your question. I thank you for missing, Warren. So on Fed Now, important development, of course, we've been watching closely. As you know, for years, we've been involved in real-time payments. So it's been our learning over the years that it's really critical that there is a proposition for merchants, there's a position for consumers for really for these systems to grow.  On the merchant side, criticality is reach. And for the consumers, it's got to be a proposition that's an easy experience and it's got consumer protection in it. So those are all aspects that the card systems have demonstrated over years, and we'll have to see where these P2P systems go with that. Fundamentally, we appreciate competition. It makes us a better company as we try to make our proposition even better. Now on FedNow very specifically here, a technical go-live is different from being available for consumers and merchants, as I've just discussed, and we have to see where that goes and what the features will be, what is the user experience, what are any kind of protections that would be in there for consumers and so forth. We will continue to seek ways to partner with B2B systems and the same applies here in the United States. For the flows that this might target, which are currently flows on account-to-account, you will recall the announcement that we've made in the last quarter with Chase on pay-by-account. So those are alternative solutions that would be in the market to capture some of these new flows. So opportunity threats, we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we're well positioned.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: And my thanks to Warren as well. I forgot that may first crept up on this. I want to ask a macro question because Michael, I think you asked for more questions last quarter. So I'll ask you one on generative AI, if that's all right. And given that you guys have -- yes, so I know you have a data analytics and consulting business within your PAS. And so just curious, how are you thinking about generative AI and Chat GPT gets a lot of attention. So your thoughts on impact on PAS maybe on the broader business as well.\nMichael Miebach: Correct. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. This is certainly a topic you got a lot of attention, particularly since the latest model of Chat GPT was out there. Bath gets attention every day, there's a whole set of headlines. I've been using AI for the better part of the last decade. So it's embedded in a whole range of our products. Just now, I talked in my prepared remarks about Bath & Bay Networks. Would you will all be surprised is actually not in Canada, but in Sweden, the company, they're using AI-enabled threat protection solutions. So you'll find it embedded in a range of our products, including generative AI. So we have used generative AI technology, particularly in creating data sets that allow us to compare and find threats in the cybersecurity space. You will find AI in our personalization products. So there's a whole range of things that we set us apart. We use this as foundational technology. And internally, you can see increasingly so, that generative AI might be a good solution for us when it comes to customer service propositions and so forth. So we're actively engaged on that. Fundamentally, though, I think we all have to be aware that the application of AI needs to be done in a principled way. We approach data privacy in a principal way. We approach crypto space in a principled way and the same thing applies here. So trustworthy the AI is clearly the focus.  We've encouraged our employees to experiment with the technology but we set very clear guardrails and don't do it in production. But it's something that we cannot afford to ignore, we will not. We will lean in, but make sure that we are a trusted party when it comes to scaling it up.\nOperator: We'll go next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. Maybe you could just give a quick update on business activity. Obviously, incentives and rebates, it's not reported the same way, but I know we have a pickup in the year. And so going back '15 and '16 -- 2015 and '16 when you had big incentive rebates here, it tended to be followed by an acceleration in volume and revenue growth in the years after. So maybe just give us a sense of what's driving the increase this year? What's -- what kind of activity levels you're seeing now? And if we can expect a similar follow-through of the years to go?\nMichael Miebach: Right. Darrin, let me start on that. We see a very encouraging activity. In fact, we -- it was tough to make choices here, what not to tell you in the 15-minute overview that I gave you. So solid activity in deal wins. And you recall some of the bigger deals that we have announced in 2021 and 2022, which are behind some of the share gains that we're seeing, particularly if you look at the Europe numbers. So that is having some impact on how the R&I plays out. But I'll defer to Sachin to say a little bit more, but overall, the activity is very healthy.\nSachin Mehra: Darrin, good morning. Look, it's like Michael said, right? I mean, we compete every day in the market. We are being successful in what we're doing in terms of winning new business and retaining existing business. That's very much the mantra on the table, we've adopted as a company. That's a very important part of the growth algorithm, which we have laid out for ourselves to drive growth for us. Because at the end of the day, we believe very firmly that being in the flow is important, picks you get the benefit of PC, you get the benefit of secular shift, but you also get to deliver additional services by being in the flow. And so really, what we are trying to do is we're trying to win profitable market share and, at the same time, drive an accretion in our overall net revenue yield, which is really about taking it together in the composite because payments and services and our new networks are very tightly integrated together. They -- one relies on the other, and we have to look at this from an overall net revenue yield base. So that's really what's going on. To your specific question about rebates and incentives, Look, I mean, we've always kind of shared with you rebates and incentives and be sharing with you what the rebates and incentives on our payment network are even now. The reality is, as and when deals come up, we will compete for them. We will do that in a smart manner. For Q2, I can tell you that rebates and incentives as a percentage of total payment network assessments, it would be roughly similar to what we had in Q1. So based on everything we can see from a line of sight standpoint in terms of deals and activity and so on and so forth, that's what I can share with you at this point in time.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rayna Kumar at UBS.\nRayna Kumar: Congratulations, Warren and Devon. I want ask about Europe. You saw a 31% volume gain in the quarter, that's outstanding. Can you talk a little bit about some of the market dynamics you're seeing in that region and whether your growth is more reflective of market share gains or just strength in the overall shift to electronic payments?\nMichael Miebach: Rayna, I think almost partially answered your question just now. So deal activity is strong. But here -- to the second half of your question there, through the last three years, you saw some European markets, some large European markets that have been historically less digitized and more cash focused to really catch up. The stats I gave earlier on contactless penetration that includes a good number of European markets jumping ahead in the ranking. So strong secular shift. That's an opportunity. You start to see some of the payment service providers driving more acceptance into more parts of the economy. And that's also reflected in some of the acceptance growth that we talked about $100 million. A good chunk of that is coming from Europe. So it's a mix of the share wins that we have seen very specifically in the U.K. and the secular shift. So we feel very well positioned in Europe.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning. Just want to ask about cross-border volume. I know it was up at 29% for the month of April -- or through April 21. Just thinking about how that might grow throughout the year. Is that the right number to think about for our models? And just thinking about the Asia recovery what\u2019s left there. Obviously, we talked about China and just thinking about that business as we progress through the year.\nSachin Mehra: Sure, Bryan. Look, just what I would tell you, I'd say the things to keep in mind when you're putting your model together, and this will be no surprise to you is we did see an opening up of economies last year coming out of COVID. And as we mentioned, in Q1, we were in the base of Omicron, you're starting to see that recovery kind of take place. And so what you should expect is there are going to be lapping-related issues, which will be a headwind to year-over-year growth rate on all metrics and in cross-border as well. Now offsetting that, to some extent, would be the recovery from Asia Pacific, which is something we saw happen towards the tail end of last year coming into this year. There are puts and takes. I'm not going to give you a specific forecast as to what that growth rate should look like from our model assumption standpoint. But I think there are these important puts and takes which you've got to kind of keep into consideration as you think about cross-border. The most important thing, I think, is that the value prop we deliver through our cross-border proposition is still fundamentally very sound. This is really important. As you remember, over the last 2 or 3 years, it was being questioned as to whether cross-border was something which was going to remain challenged over the long term. The reality is it has come back. It has come back strong.  We have positioned ourselves really well through the pandemic period. to be winning good portfolios to be able to ride the way back up, and you're seeing the results of that come through with some really strong cross-border performance in Q1 with 35% year-over-year growth. And so the reality is that cross-border proposition remains good. Just as a matter of reference, if you look at our cross-border volumes for Q1 at 168% of 2019, and you can do this math as well. The reality is that reflects approximately a 14% compound annual growth rate over the window from prior to the pandemic to where we are in Q1. And so you've pretty much bought up the last time as part of that process, if you go back to what historical rates in cross-border work. So I kind of wanted to share that with you in terms of how we see cross-border going forward.\nOperator: We'll move next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good morning. I guess, I know you're not changing your views on the macro for the rest of the year, but you're monitoring the situation. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color if we parse underneath the covers. Just what gives you the confidence things are stable despite the slowing in April -- March and April? And then sort of the forward look on the spending trends in cross-border?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Sanjay. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, what we see is what you see from a consumer standpoint. And we have our best estimates as to what we kind of think that looks like on a go-forward basis. Like Michael said, there are positive and negative factors. The health of the consumer remains strong, backed by record low unemployment rates, and that gives us a level of confidence. On the flip side, you've got the headwinds which come along with higher interest rates, more recently the banking crisis, which we're all going through. And we have no idea as to what the implications of the banking crisis are going to look like on a go-forward basis. So our views in terms of the strength of the consumer remains pretty much unchanged. There are puts and takes by region. And based on the fact that at this point in time, there's no real evidence to see that the consumer is not showing good strength from a spend standpoint. They're in good shape. The year-over-year growth rates, like I mentioned earlier, are going to change. You're going to see the lapping effect of that come through because of the recovery last year. That's got less to do with what spend levels this year are as compared to anything else. And it's on the base of that, that we have modestly increased our full year guide on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, to reflect the fact that we had a stronger Q1. And we feel like overall, from a consumer health standpoint, our assumptions are relatively unchanged between what it was one quarter ago towards where we are right now.\nMichael Miebach: One thing to add here, I'm just looking at my phone here, can you imagine in the conference call, but it was the reporting of the quarter 1 GDV numbers. And if you look into that, there is -- the consumer does stand out positively. So the resilience even in that number is reflected. I think -- the point on that I mentioned earlier on the impact of stresses on the banking sector. That's another one that we did talk about. And here, if you think about what does this mean in terms of potentially additional regulation, what it means in terms of credit appetite for banks and self-host. Those are all not near-term effects that we're -- we can judge at this point in time.  So some of the outlook that we are taking here is a near-term outlook for the year, and we'll have to see how things develop over time. Again, flexibility and agility is critical. And so we feel ready for all of that.\nOperator: We'll move next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. I have question on value-added services. Can you unpack the competitor set for these different services, cyber intelligence, data services, other and kind of highlight Mastercard's opportunity to increase penetration of these services within existing client base and also continue to get new clients? And just as a follow-up, Sachin, if you can also remind us of the profitability of value-added services versus your business and network business is that a good? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Harshita, let me start on this. So first on the competitive landscape. As Sachin was saying earlier, our services strategy is closely tied in with our payment strategy. So we're not your average service competitor as in a cybersecurity company that competes with a bunch of other cybersecurity companies. We are somewhere in the middle between bolts and being in the flow gives us additional data points that makes us a fairly unique competitive landscape for us, which is why we like the combination of both.  But it's very specifically on cybersecurity. You have a whole set of specialty players Bath & Bay was a specialty player and yet, we're dealing in threat protection. As we were ourselves with Risk Recon before, it's just a slightly different angle of that. So we are very aware of the wide competitive landscape here, but our position, I think, sets us apart. Now there's other potential comes closer to the payment space. So looking at services as well. So we're trying to keep our services set differentiated and ahead of the curve. It's the same thing for data and services. Yet again, a lot of data and SaaS companies that are building their businesses.  But on the other hand, we have a captive set of customers today, and we have a captive set of transactions of these customers that these companies want to understand and where do they come to an integrated provider that helps them with both. So that's, again, a unique position for us. To look at, I think dynamic yield and how we're combining that with our data set, as I referred to my earlier remarks, I think it's an excellent example of that. So that's the competitive landscape that we're looking at. It's a fast-moving one. So we have -- we will continue to have that in focus.\nSachin Mehra: Harshita, I'll just add a couple of thoughts to what Michael said, I'll get to your question around how the financials play out for -- what we on the services side. So a couple of things. One, just even adding to what Michael said, structurally, if you think about how the world is going more digital and as the world goes more digital, there is going to be likely increasing fraud-related issues which come on increasingly digital world. There are structural tailwinds, which we feel good about. And so long as we can continue to grow our portfolio to ride those structural tailwinds is another piece which helps us think that there is good runway on services.  The second piece, which Michael said, which was around data and the power of data is one of the ingredients which makes us successful across both C&I and D&S. But then there are others, which is do you have the technology? Do you have the AI capabilities? And can you seamlessly deliver this to your customers so that there isn't big implementation challenges? All of which when you think about our network play, allow us to do that in a very efficient manner, which is what's been helping us drive the kind of growth we've seen. On your question on the financials, I will tell you that, I mean, there's a range of, what I would call, incremental costs, which come depending on the nature of the service we deliver. So things which are more, I would say, attached to the payment network, such as some of our cyber and intelligence solutions, some of our data solutions, they tend to come with lower incremental cost. There are others such as our consulting capabilities, such as our service capabilities, they come with a little bit higher in the nature of incremental cost. And so the overall mix is really important because they all kind of hang together. It's important for us to provide those consulting services and marketing services in order to be able to be a full service provider to our customers. And that's only speaking about services. Now when you take that and you kind of tie that back to how it helps us win market share and payments. That's the other piece which is super important as part of this because the economics need to be thought about in the composite as opposed to each one of these services individually.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Togut at Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Last summer, London Heathrow Airport put some severe capacity limits on airlines. Those limits came off a while back, but I'm curious whether you're getting any indication on advanced cross-border summer travel as things opened up a bit more at Heathrow and how can we think about the impact on cross-border revenue for the rest of this year?\nSachin Mehra: Sure, David. What I'd say, I'd say you hear what we hear as it relates to what the airlines plans are from a capacity release standpoint. And the reality is, I think everybody is trying to kind of find that right balance between bringing on more capacity and what the implications for the price proceed is as part of that process. And so we feel generally good about the prospects of travel. I mean the reality is there's a trend from the convert towards more spending on experiences. Experience tends to be travel and entertainment-related stuff. And so generally speaking, that trend is going in the right direction. As more capacity comes on, which we expect will happen, right, you will tend to see the benefit of that come through in our cross-border travel metrics. Again, I would remind you, strong value prop, year-over-year lapping issues which are there from a year-over rate as a standpoint. And then the third piece is we have the potential for recovery in Asia Pacific. And I wanted to kind of bring that whole thing into the picture beyond the capacity question you asked.\nMichael Miebach: So hard to predict, but the fact is capacity isn't fully back. So that's one important aspect when we gave you the outlook later on.\nDavid Togut: Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on Europe. Just your updated thoughts on the rollout of ACH payments in Europe under open banking would be appreciated.\nMichael Miebach: Right, David. So let me take a look at that. Conversations in Europe have been going on for years on ACH systems. As you know, when the U.K. was part of the EU, I don't even know if it's Europe right now or not, but we invested in Vocalink. So we have a counter account systems in Europe for a long time. We're having some stakes in other P2P systems on the continent and so forth.  The most late -- the most recent development here is the announcement around the European payment initiative, which is yet another effort in account to account. Europe is the land of domestic systems and domestic payment solutions. It's a very versatile competitive landscape, and there is more coming. We have found ways to partner. We have found ways to compete. And in the case of EPI, we are partnering with the owner banks to push our solutions.  At the same time, we'll have to see where EPI goes, and then we stand ready to engage one way or another depending on their willingness. As you can see, Europe has been a source of share growth for us and revenue growth. So we know how to play this environment.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And best of luck to Warren in his future endeavours. My question is for Sachin. I wanted to ask -- you called out tax refunds a couple of times just weighing on U.S. volumes sort of more recently. Should we think about that as normalizing into Q2? Does it flip to more of a tailwind? And then I guess, secondarily, how do you see the spread, which is pretty wide between U.S. and worldwide metrics trending this year, ex Russia? Will it stay pretty wide? Will it tighten as maybe tax refunds normalize? How are you looking at it?\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Look, I mean, the data we look at for what we're seeing from a tax refund standpoint is what we see on the IRS website, right? And so you can take that for what it's worth because that's the insight we've kind of garnered. What we've seen is that the tax refunds tend to happen mostly in this window around, call it, March and going into April. So we view this impact of the lower tax refund to be relatively transitory. And I say that only because as the year progresses, if there were lower tax refunds, the implications of that would be minimal just because the vast majority of the refunds happen around the period we're talking about right now. So that's why we use them as being transitory. The other thing to keep in mind is on account of some of the natural which have taken place, there are some states in the U.S., which have -- where from a federal tax standpoint, they've been given more latitude in terms of what the tax filing date is. And so that's the other thing to keep in mind in terms of what the potential might be for a catch-up on some of these lower tax free funds. Again, very hard to predict, but I want to kind of bring those 2 pieces out there. On your second question on U.S. versus rest of world trends. At the highest level, I'd tell you, I feel pretty good about what we are seeing on our overall operating metrics. I mean these are pretty compelling operating metrics from a growth rate standpoint. You've got 15% credit growth taking place in the U.S., is being driven in a large part by just consumers' desire to get back to experiences. Our portfolios, our co-branded portfolios, our travel portfolio are performing very well.  And again, if you kind of were to think about the go forward, the reality comes back to the broader questions we were talking about how do we feel about drivers from a domestic spend standpoint and the cross-border spend standpoint, all of that will manifest itself in terms of what U.S. volumes look like going forward. On the rest of the world side, obviously, we've got some really good metrics there as well, both across debit and credit. And you're seeing the impact of some of our market share wins in those metrics. As the year progresses, you're going to start to see the impact of that market share on some of the players start to tail off just because you'll be reaching the lapping stage on that. So you need to keep that in mind. That should help you kind of model out as to how the gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world plays out as we progress through the year.\nRamsey El-Assal: Super helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey at Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate taking the questions. Michael, I'd like to ask you about the India opportunity and specifically the potential inclusion or inclusion of Mastercard credit products and UPI. I just wonder if you could frame that up so much talk about rest of world growth in cash-based economies and especially those in which perhaps account-funded wallets have moved to the 4. Can you just dimensionalize or give us an update on your India positioning?\nMichael Miebach: Right. So India is a hugely important market for us. We have a large number of our employees based in India, serving the Indian market as well as other markets in Asia, deep engagements with customers there. It's interesting when you look at the market from where it has gone under the lead of India's government, they've built a tremendous digital economy. So the India tech stack has really opened up the digital economy at a much, much different scale than before, and we like that. That gives you opportunities for us to engage with our customers to many more Indian citizens. So we generally see that opportunity. It's also true, though, that today, every day solution around debit and credit matter. And we have -- now we reached -- we're back to pre-embargo growth on the issuing side with our customers in India. So that is looking very, very positive. We're back in the market there.  So we're playing both of that. It's a market where we'll see more innovation coming from us of the folks that are based there. So there isn't a financial inclusion opportunity. There's an everyday opportunity in credit and debit and it's not the most populous country in the world. So it's going to be the theatre of the future, and we're excited to be involved there. Where is all the engagement going with the India tech stack? What does it mean for our cards? And how will cards be linked into UPI and so forth? The details have yet to be seen, but we're active in those conversations. And in the end, when we have an opportunity to partner, then we will try to do that.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I look forward to tracking that. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: I think we have time for one more caller. \nOperator: And we'll take that from Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Maybe just building on that last question a little bit. You just talked about India to some extent. But which emerging geographies are you most excited about over, say, the next five years or so just in terms of the general cash-to-card opportunity? \nMichael Miebach: Right, Jason. So here, the opportunity, I wouldn't really point to a particular geography. I think generally, the set of countries that have a lower digitization rate is a tremendous opportunity for us. We have learned how to drive digitization. Just look at Latin America, you take like a country like Mexico, a tremendous opportunity in terms of driving digitization up. And part of that we have seen in Brazil. So you can start to make those comparisons and you add that up across the wood that is a tremendous opportunity. In terms of large-scale country opportunities, we just talked about India and certainly not in the category of emerging markets, but China is a market that we are very engaged on today in the cross-border business, and you do know that we have a license application out there to participate in the domestic market and we stand ready to invest forward with the Chinese consumers and businesses. So we'll see where that one goes.\nWarren Kneeshaw: Thanks, Michael. Any final comments?\nMichael Miebach: I do have final comments. So I've made it a habit to thank the 30,000 people at Mastercard for what they did, what they all do. And I shall do that again for this quarter. I thought it was a good quarter, and it is reflective of their work. But I do want to thank you as well, Warren. So it's been fun three years for me and previously with Ajay. So thank you for everything that you did. I know we all talk about you. I do want to talk about Devon as well. So if you could picture us here in this room, here's Devon, and we're looking forward Sachin and I to work with you. And I do want to say, Warren has -- you have built a tremendous set of relationships with the folks on the call. And I look to those folks on the call, first of all, thanking you guys for your support, but also to give Devon, the same kind of support that you have in the past. With that, thank you very much and speak to you one quarter from now.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page three, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items, and the impact of gains and losses on equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross border travel. Operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt increase on acquisitions.  Operating income was up 17% which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 2%, which includes the 1 ppt decrease in two acquisitions, EPS was up 4% year over year to $2.80, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. Of note, the respective growth rates of net income and EPS were negatively impacted by a low tax rate in 2022 as a result of sizeable discrete tax benefits last year. During the quarter we repurchase 2.9 billion worth of stock, and an additional 602 million through April 24 2023. So now let's turn to Page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 15% year over year on a local currency basis.  On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV increased by 16%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 9%, with credit growth of 15% reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 3%, excluding the impact of the roll off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 6%. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 18% with credit growth of 17% and debit growth of 19%.  Cross border volume was up 35% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel related cross border spending.  Turning to Page five, Switched transactions grew 12% year over year in Q1. Excluding Russia from the prior year, the switched transactions grew 20% year over year in Q1. Both card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents over 58% of all in person switched purchase transaction. In addition, card growth was 9%, globally there are 3.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued. Turning so Slide six, for a look into our net revenues for the first quarter, which were above our expectations. As a reminder, we recently revised that disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into two new categories, payment network and value added services and solutions.  Now getting into the numbers described on a currency neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 10%, which would have been 1 ppt higher if we excluded the Russia related special item which benefitted Q1 2022. The growth in payment network was primarily driven by domestic and cross border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives.  Value added services and solutions net revenue increased 21%, including a 1 ppt benefit from acquisitions. The growth was primarily driven by the continued strong growth of our cyber and intelligence solutions driven by underlying driver growth, higher demand for our fraud solutions, as well as the scaling of our identity and authentication solutions. And we saw healthy demand for our data analytics, consulting and marketing services, as well as our loyalty solutions.  Now let's turn to Page seven, starting with key metrics related to payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 15%. The difference is primarily driven by mix and the underreporting of volumes from sanctioned customers in Russia last year, which accounted for approximately 2 ppt of the variance. Cross-border assessments increased 39%, while cross-border volumes increased 35%. The both PPT difference is primarily due to favourable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.  Transaction processing assessments were up 14%, while switch transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to FX-related revenues. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $212 million this quarter. It's important to note that these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving now to Page eight. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12%, including a 2 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.  Operating expenses were higher than expected in part due to personnel costs to support higher-than-expected revenue as well as unfavourable foreign exchange related due to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Turning to Page nine. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of April. As a general comment, our metrics are holding up well in April. As expected, the year-over-year growth rates are being impacted by 2 opposing factors: one, more difficult comps as we began lapping the effects of Omicron; and two, the lapping of the drag created by the suspension of our operations in Russia in March of last year. To aid in your understanding of the underlying spending trends and eliminate some of the noise induced by the lapping effects, we have also included the metric Index 2019 levels on the slide. Let's discuss each of the metrics in turn.  Starting with switched volumes. Through the first three weeks ago, we grew 17% year-over-year, down 1 ppt versus Q1. This reflects more difficult comps and some modest slowing in the U.S. due to lower tax refunds. This started in March and continued into April. This is partially offset by a 3 ppt benefit from the lapping of Russia. Switch transactions grew 18% year-over-year through the first 3 weeks of April, up 6 ppt versus Q1. This includes an 8 ppt benefit from the lapping of the suspension of operations in Russia. As a reminder, Russia had a relatively low average ticket size, which results in a larger relative impact to this metric. In terms of cross-border, volumes grew 29% on a year-over-year basis, down 6 ppt from Q1. This reflects the continued recovery in cross-border travel as well as the positive impact of lapping the suspension of our Russian operations, but is more than offset by a tougher year ago comp as travel surged after the passage of Omicron last year. Cross-border volume is indexing at 171% of 2019 levels in April, up from 168% in Q1. To further assist your understanding of the trends in the business ex Russia, where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix to show all data points from the schedule if you exclude activity from Russian issued cards from current and prior periods. Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified business model and our momentum with our customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. Consumer spending overall remains healthy, albeit with some recent moderation in domestic spending in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds this year. At the same time, as Michael noted, the recovery in cross-border travel continues with inbound travel to all regions now well above 2019 levels. Within Asia, in Q1, China outbound cross-border travel increased to approximately 65% of Q1 2019 levels, while inbound reached 45% on the same basis. As a reminder, China made up 2% of outbound and 1% of inbound cross-border travel in 2019. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario assumes consumer spending remains resilient and cross-border travel continues to recover. For the year, our outlook has improved modestly, reflecting our stronger-than-expected performance in Q1. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to be at a low teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact for the year. Again, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth. With respect to the second quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate again on a continual basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off of a strong Q1, this sequentially reflects a tougher year ago comp, lower anticipated FX volatility, partially offset by lapping the suspension of operations in Russia. Foreign exchange and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 growth to be at the high end of a low double-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This includes cost of approximately 2 ppt associated with the wind down of our efforts related to the P27 project, given their decision to withdraw their license application in the Nordics. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt. Other items to keep in mind, first, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $100 million for Q2 given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels, which includes a sequential increase due to our recent debt issuance. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18.5% and 19% for both Q2 and the full year based on the current geographic mix of our business. Before I turn the call back over to Warren to begin the Q&A session, I wanted to express my deep gratitude to Warren for the thought leadership, dedication and friendship he has demonstrated over his last 6-plus years at Mastercard. As previously announced, Warren will be handing over the head of IR role to Devon Core effective May 1, and will be with us through your end in an advisory capacity. Thank you, Warren and over to you for the Q&A session. Darrin, good morning. Look, it's like Michael said, right? I mean, we compete every day in the market. We are being successful in what we're doing in terms of winning new business and retaining existing business. That's very much the mantra on the table, we've adopted as a company. That's a very important part of the growth algorithm, which we have laid out for ourselves to drive growth for us. Because at the end of the day, we believe very firmly that being in the flow is important, picks you get the benefit of PC, you get the benefit of secular shift, but you also get to deliver additional services by being in the flow. And so really, what we are trying to do is we're trying to win profitable market share and, at the same time, drive an accretion in our overall net revenue yield, which is really about taking it together in the composite because payments and services and our new networks are very tightly integrated together. They -- one relies on the other, and we have to look at this from an overall net revenue yield base. So that's really what's going on. To your specific question about rebates and incentives, Look, I mean, we've always kind of shared with you rebates and incentives and be sharing with you what the rebates and incentives on our payment network are even now. The reality is, as and when deals come up, we will compete for them. We will do that in a smart manner. For Q2, I can tell you that rebates and incentives as a percentage of total payment network assessments, it would be roughly similar to what we had in Q1. So based on everything we can see from a line of sight standpoint in terms of deals and activity and so on and so forth, that's what I can share with you at this point in time. Sure, Bryan. Look, just what I would tell you, I'd say the things to keep in mind when you're putting your model together, and this will be no surprise to you is we did see an opening up of economies last year coming out of COVID. And as we mentioned, in Q1, we were in the base of Omicron, you're starting to see that recovery kind of take place. And so what you should expect is there are going to be lapping-related issues, which will be a headwind to year-over-year growth rate on all metrics and in cross-border as well. Now offsetting that, to some extent, would be the recovery from Asia Pacific, which is something we saw happen towards the tail end of last year coming into this year. There are puts and takes. I'm not going to give you a specific forecast as to what that growth rate should look like from our model assumption standpoint. But I think there are these important puts and takes which you've got to kind of keep into consideration as you think about cross-border. The most important thing, I think, is that the value prop we deliver through our cross-border proposition is still fundamentally very sound. This is really important. As you remember, over the last 2 or 3 years, it was being questioned as to whether cross-border was something which was going to remain challenged over the long term. The reality is it has come back. It has come back strong.  We have positioned ourselves really well through the pandemic period. to be winning good portfolios to be able to ride the way back up, and you're seeing the results of that come through with some really strong cross-border performance in Q1 with 35% year-over-year growth. And so the reality is that cross-border proposition remains good. Just as a matter of reference, if you look at our cross-border volumes for Q1 at 168% of 2019, and you can do this math as well. The reality is that reflects approximately a 14% compound annual growth rate over the window from prior to the pandemic to where we are in Q1. And so you've pretty much bought up the last time as part of that process, if you go back to what historical rates in cross-border work. So I kind of wanted to share that with you in terms of how we see cross-border going forward. Yes. Sanjay. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, what we see is what you see from a consumer standpoint. And we have our best estimates as to what we kind of think that looks like on a go-forward basis. Like Michael said, there are positive and negative factors. The health of the consumer remains strong, backed by record low unemployment rates, and that gives us a level of confidence. On the flip side, you've got the headwinds which come along with higher interest rates, more recently the banking crisis, which we're all going through. And we have no idea as to what the implications of the banking crisis are going to look like on a go-forward basis. So our views in terms of the strength of the consumer remains pretty much unchanged. There are puts and takes by region. And based on the fact that at this point in time, there's no real evidence to see that the consumer is not showing good strength from a spend standpoint. They're in good shape. The year-over-year growth rates, like I mentioned earlier, are going to change. You're going to see the lapping effect of that come through because of the recovery last year. That's got less to do with what spend levels this year are as compared to anything else. And it's on the base of that, that we have modestly increased our full year guide on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, to reflect the fact that we had a stronger Q1. And we feel like overall, from a consumer health standpoint, our assumptions are relatively unchanged between what it was one quarter ago towards where we are right now. Harshita, I'll just add a couple of thoughts to what Michael said, I'll get to your question around how the financials play out for -- what we on the services side. So a couple of things. One, just even adding to what Michael said, structurally, if you think about how the world is going more digital and as the world goes more digital, there is going to be likely increasing fraud-related issues which come on increasingly digital world. There are structural tailwinds, which we feel good about. And so long as we can continue to grow our portfolio to ride those structural tailwinds is another piece which helps us think that there is good runway on services.  The second piece, which Michael said, which was around data and the power of data is one of the ingredients which makes us successful across both C&I and D&S. But then there are others, which is do you have the technology? Do you have the AI capabilities? And can you seamlessly deliver this to your customers so that there isn't big implementation challenges? All of which when you think about our network play, allow us to do that in a very efficient manner, which is what's been helping us drive the kind of growth we've seen. On your question on the financials, I will tell you that, I mean, there's a range of, what I would call, incremental costs, which come depending on the nature of the service we deliver. So things which are more, I would say, attached to the payment network, such as some of our cyber and intelligence solutions, some of our data solutions, they tend to come with lower incremental cost. There are others such as our consulting capabilities, such as our service capabilities, they come with a little bit higher in the nature of incremental cost. And so the overall mix is really important because they all kind of hang together. It's important for us to provide those consulting services and marketing services in order to be able to be a full service provider to our customers. And that's only speaking about services. Now when you take that and you kind of tie that back to how it helps us win market share and payments. That's the other piece which is super important as part of this because the economics need to be thought about in the composite as opposed to each one of these services individually. Sure, David. What I'd say, I'd say you hear what we hear as it relates to what the airlines plans are from a capacity release standpoint. And the reality is, I think everybody is trying to kind of find that right balance between bringing on more capacity and what the implications for the price proceed is as part of that process. And so we feel generally good about the prospects of travel. I mean the reality is there's a trend from the convert towards more spending on experiences. Experience tends to be travel and entertainment-related stuff. And so generally speaking, that trend is going in the right direction. As more capacity comes on, which we expect will happen, right, you will tend to see the benefit of that come through in our cross-border travel metrics. Again, I would remind you, strong value prop, year-over-year lapping issues which are there from a year-over rate as a standpoint. And then the third piece is we have the potential for recovery in Asia Pacific. And I wanted to kind of bring that whole thing into the picture beyond the capacity question you asked. Yes. Look, I mean, the data we look at for what we're seeing from a tax refund standpoint is what we see on the IRS website, right? And so you can take that for what it's worth because that's the insight we've kind of garnered. What we've seen is that the tax refunds tend to happen mostly in this window around, call it, March and going into April. So we view this impact of the lower tax refund to be relatively transitory. And I say that only because as the year progresses, if there were lower tax refunds, the implications of that would be minimal just because the vast majority of the refunds happen around the period we're talking about right now. So that's why we use them as being transitory. The other thing to keep in mind is on account of some of the natural which have taken place, there are some states in the U.S., which have -- where from a federal tax standpoint, they've been given more latitude in terms of what the tax filing date is. And so that's the other thing to keep in mind in terms of what the potential might be for a catch-up on some of these lower tax free funds. Again, very hard to predict, but I want to kind of bring those 2 pieces out there. On your second question on U.S. versus rest of world trends. At the highest level, I'd tell you, I feel pretty good about what we are seeing on our overall operating metrics. I mean these are pretty compelling operating metrics from a growth rate standpoint. You've got 15% credit growth taking place in the U.S., is being driven in a large part by just consumers' desire to get back to experiences. Our portfolios, our co-branded portfolios, our travel portfolio are performing very well.  And again, if you kind of were to think about the go forward, the reality comes back to the broader questions we were talking about how do we feel about drivers from a domestic spend standpoint and the cross-border spend standpoint, all of that will manifest itself in terms of what U.S. volumes look like going forward. On the rest of the world side, obviously, we've got some really good metrics there as well, both across debit and credit. And you're seeing the impact of some of our market share wins in those metrics. As the year progresses, you're going to start to see the impact of that market share on some of the players start to tail off just because you'll be reaching the lapping stage on that. So you need to keep that in mind. That should help you kind of model out as to how the gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world plays out as we progress through the year."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. Another quarter, let's jump right in. The headline is that in quarter one, consumer spending has remained remarkably resilient in that despite continued economic uncertainty. We kicked off the year with strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter one adjusted net revenues were up 15% and adjusted operating income was up 17%, both versus a year ago, and as always on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis excluding special items.  Focusing on the macro for a moment. Let's take stock of the positive and negative factors we have been monitoring. First, the labor market in aggregate remains strong by savings remain above historical levels and consumers continue to access credit, which all are key drivers of consumer spending.  Second, central banks continue to combat elevated inflation levels with higher interest rates. Although we are seeing signs of inflation, putting additional stresses on the banking sector have emerged. We will continue to monitor how banks respond to these evolving conditions.  And finally, economic growth around the globe continues to vary by country and sector. The reopening of China is a positive catalyst. However, the impact of monetary and fiscal tightening in many countries will likely be with us for some time. So overall, many moving pieces but even so consumer spending levels have remained resilience while the mix of spending has continued to rebalance towards experiences. Looking at our switched volume trends, domestic volume growth has remained relatively stable with some recent moderation in the U.S., in part due to lower tax refunds. Cross-border travel in quarter one reached 148% of 2019 levels with all regions above 2019 levels. This includes notable improvement in Asia cross-border card not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. We will continue to watch the environment closely. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we are prepared to adjust investment levels appropriately while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. And as a reminder, these three priorities are expanding and payments, extending our services and embracing new networks.  Now I've been on the road for much of the quarter meeting with customers, partners, government leaders, and of course, our teams. These conversations reinforced the energy we have for our collaborative approach, and show the importance that many plays on digital payments and driving much of today's economic activity. And it's with that in mind that I'll share some examples of how we are progressing against our three strategic priorities.  First, we're expanding in payments by winning deals across a diverse set of customers innovating in and growing acceptance, and expanding solutions to address new payment flows. We see our partnership deepening with a diverse set of co-brand partners, financial institutions and fast growing fintechs around the world. This quarter we had a significant win with Costco Wholesale in Taiwan, the largest co-brand portfolio in the market. The deal is a competitive flip that ensures exclusive co-brand issuance and exclusive acceptance of Mastercard, co-brand cards and stores effectives in August this year.  We also announced our exclusive partnership with Wells Fargo and Choice Hotels, to launch their new credit card program in the United States. In the Middle East, we inked a renewal with National Bank of Egypt, the largest issuer in the country. And on the fintech front, we renewed our deal with N26, one of the largest new banks in Europe, for Mastercard to be the exclusive provider for issuing and processing services.  And in Latin America, we've expanded our relationship with Uala\u0301, one of the fastest growing fintechs in the region, to be the exclusive network of prepaid debit and credit. So we are continuing on our trajectory delivering another solid quarter of new and renewed wins, an important element of our growth algorithm. Beyond new wins, we are driving growth in payments through the development of innovative solutions, like our instalment offerings. In Australia, we're scaling our solutions with some of the largest banks in the market, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac. Providing the way to pay is central to what we do, so to is making sure people and businesses can use those payment tools whenever they want. Along those lines, we are continuing to drive growth in acceptance, expanding connectivity and trust across all forms of card payments. Our acceptance footprint has now surpassed 100 million locations effectively doubling over the past five years. And that's just the start. Our innovative contactless, cloud commerce and click to pay solutions give more merchants the ability to accept electronic payments with simple technology connectivity. To us that's an opportunity to bring more physical and digital transactions onto our network. Over 100 markets have now reached at least 50% contactless penetration double the number three years ago. Contactless drives higher consumer engagement and helps to accelerate the secular shift to digital payments by accessing lower ticket size purchases that have historically been cash based. In quarter one, our tokenization capability was selected as part of a mobile payments launches in South Korea, and even a significant number of private label cards for contactless and thereby giving us the opportunity to deliver services on those transactions. We continue to see momentum in tap on phone, with programs across more than 70 markets globally. We continue to scale, including the Stripe announced in quarter 1 that they have enabled tap-to-pay on Android in multiple markets. In addition to helping our partners bring tap-on-phone to market, our cloud commerce acceptance technology is now live in Europe. Our cloud commerce capabilities make it easier and tricker for businesses of all sizes to accept payments on virtually any device. And click-to-pay is now live in nearly 30 markets globally, including key markets such as Australia, Brazil, U.K. and U.S. We are partnering with payment service providers like Mexico and Italy to further expand our presence. This is all complemented by our workers' partners to grow acceptance by integrating the payment experience where their customers are. You see that in the social commerce space with what's happened in Brazil, enabling consumers to make purchases directly from small businesses right within a chat. Further, we remain focused on expanding our set of new payment capabilities to capture a prioritized set of new payment flows. I'll highlight a couple of areas we are targeting, starting with commercial. We had a strong growth in the space with volumes across our commercial credit and debit products in quarter 1, up 21% versus the prior year on a local currency basis. We see substantial opportunity to grow in commercial, particularly with our virtual card and small business solutions. With virtual cards where we are the market leader, one of our initiatives is to integrate our solutions with leading B2B technology platforms. This quarter, we signed a partnership agreement with Coupa to enhance their Coupa Pay solution, which embeds virtual cards to address accounts payable flows. On a small business front, today, only a small fraction of payments are captured on card. We are enhancing the value propositions from programs like Easy Savings, which offers automatic merchant-funded rebates to nearly 40 million enrolled cardholders in over 80 countries. And we are growing by establishing new issuance deals through partners like Galileo in the United States, the Mastercard will be the preferred brand for small business and commercial programs. Now beyond commercial, disbursement and remittances flows represent a significant opportunity for growth through geographic expansion, new distribution partners and an expanding set of use cases. In terms of new markets, our gaming use case is now live in Canada and Peru, and we have added cross-border origination to the UAE and Uzbekistan. By connecting with MFS Africa, a leading digital payment company, we have enabled mobile payouts across 10 markets in Africa. We are working with distribution partners like checkout.com to increase reach to even more customers in Asia and the United States. And we're enabling our cross-border services solutions to small and midsized banks through cross-border services express with this simple-to-use digital-first solution, participating financial institutions can offer their customers the ability to send money or pay vendors across the globe quickly and securely. In terms of expanding use cases, we have enabled cash in U.S., in Europe and the U.K., facilitating underbanked customers to safely load cash into their accounts from a nonbank location, which can also help drive follow-on card spend. So as you can see, we continue to make broad-based progress in addressing our prioritized set of new payment flows. Turning now to services. We love services, where we are focused on growth and resiliency through scaling our existing solutions and adding new capabilities. As merchants as consumers shift to digital, our comprehensive set of cybersecurity solutions becomes even more critical. For instance, risk recon helps an enterprise identify their own cybersecurity vulnerabilities as well as for their ecosystem partners. With our acquisition Baffin Bay Networks this quarter, we now have a solution to help these customers act on this information. Specifically, Baffin Bay's AI enabled cloud based threat protection helps to stop cyber attacks related to malware, ransomware, and DDoS attacks. The acquisition also complements our other cyber offerings, including our simulation and assessment tools, as well as our cybersecurity consulting practice.  You all are familiar with our comprehensive set of data analytics, marketing, and loyalty assets. These are about helping our partners make smarter decisions to drive better outcomes. For example, Agoda, one of the world's fastest growing online travel platforms in Asia, is leveraging our economic insights to inform their strategic planning. To meet among such, the largest electronics retailer in Europe, is utilizing our test and learn capabilities to support the assessment and optimization of new business initiatives.  We also continue to make progress signing deals with retailers and commerce partners, like Hyundai Motors, Europe, and Puma, to utilize our recently acquired personalization platforms Dynamic Yield. We continue to look for ways to combine all these assets to deliver valuable end to end solutions. We just announced elements a suite of applications which brings insights for Mastercards data analytics to enrich dynamic yields personalization experience.  Our third key priority area is embracing new networks where we are making progress in the areas of open banking and digital identity. In open banking, we continue to work with a broad set of banks and fintechs who are interested in its potential across a wide range of use cases. In addition to the Pay-by-Bank solution for JP Morgan that we announced last quarter, we are working with payment risk and identification company GIACT, member of the London Exchange to embed a secure account verification solution.  Also, Saxo Bank will use our open banking technology for account opening and top ups in Europe. Further, we're developing capabilities on top of our open banking platform, we have advanced analytics partner with Fintech, innovators like [indiscernible] Nath, enigma and Gen Equity to expand access to capital, with better data for making lending decisions.  This is another great example of how our technology supports small business. Moving next to digital identity. We continue to see strong adoption of our intelligent identity solutions powered by machine learning. This quarter, we secured a key partnership with Southwest to embed our intelligent identity solutions from content to reduce fraud and friction in digital interactions.  Still early stages with open banking and digital identity, but we are making progress scaling our technology to new markets and use cases with notable partners. So with that, I'll wrap it up and in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, reflecting a resilient consumer and the continued recovery of cross border travel. We will continue to watch the environment closely and are prepared to act as circumstances dictate. We see a significant opportunity ahead having now surpassed 100 million acceptance locations worldwide. And our focus strategy, diversified and resilient business model and strong relationships around the globe position as well through economic cycles.  Sachin over to you. Good morning, Lisa, thanks for your question. I thank you for missing, Warren. So on Fed Now, important development, of course, we've been watching closely. As you know, for years, we've been involved in real-time payments. So it's been our learning over the years that it's really critical that there is a proposition for merchants, there's a position for consumers for really for these systems to grow.  On the merchant side, criticality is reach. And for the consumers, it's got to be a proposition that's an easy experience and it's got consumer protection in it. So those are all aspects that the card systems have demonstrated over years, and we'll have to see where these P2P systems go with that. Fundamentally, we appreciate competition. It makes us a better company as we try to make our proposition even better. Now on FedNow very specifically here, a technical go-live is different from being available for consumers and merchants, as I've just discussed, and we have to see where that goes and what the features will be, what is the user experience, what are any kind of protections that would be in there for consumers and so forth. We will continue to seek ways to partner with B2B systems and the same applies here in the United States. For the flows that this might target, which are currently flows on account-to-account, you will recall the announcement that we've made in the last quarter with Chase on pay-by-account. So those are alternative solutions that would be in the market to capture some of these new flows. So opportunity threats, we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we're well positioned. Correct. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. This is certainly a topic you got a lot of attention, particularly since the latest model of Chat GPT was out there. Bath gets attention every day, there's a whole set of headlines. I've been using AI for the better part of the last decade. So it's embedded in a whole range of our products. Just now, I talked in my prepared remarks about Bath & Bay Networks. Would you will all be surprised is actually not in Canada, but in Sweden, the company, they're using AI-enabled threat protection solutions. So you'll find it embedded in a range of our products, including generative AI. So we have used generative AI technology, particularly in creating data sets that allow us to compare and find threats in the cybersecurity space. You will find AI in our personalization products. So there's a whole range of things that we set us apart. We use this as foundational technology. And internally, you can see increasingly so, that generative AI might be a good solution for us when it comes to customer service propositions and so forth. So we're actively engaged on that. Fundamentally, though, I think we all have to be aware that the application of AI needs to be done in a principled way. We approach data privacy in a principal way. We approach crypto space in a principled way and the same thing applies here. So trustworthy the AI is clearly the focus.  We've encouraged our employees to experiment with the technology but we set very clear guardrails and don't do it in production. But it's something that we cannot afford to ignore, we will not. We will lean in, but make sure that we are a trusted party when it comes to scaling it up. Right. Darrin, let me start on that. We see a very encouraging activity. In fact, we -- it was tough to make choices here, what not to tell you in the 15-minute overview that I gave you. So solid activity in deal wins. And you recall some of the bigger deals that we have announced in 2021 and 2022, which are behind some of the share gains that we're seeing, particularly if you look at the Europe numbers. So that is having some impact on how the R&I plays out. But I'll defer to Sachin to say a little bit more, but overall, the activity is very healthy. Rayna, I think almost partially answered your question just now. So deal activity is strong. But here -- to the second half of your question there, through the last three years, you saw some European markets, some large European markets that have been historically less digitized and more cash focused to really catch up. The stats I gave earlier on contactless penetration that includes a good number of European markets jumping ahead in the ranking. So strong secular shift. That's an opportunity. You start to see some of the payment service providers driving more acceptance into more parts of the economy. And that's also reflected in some of the acceptance growth that we talked about $100 million. A good chunk of that is coming from Europe. So it's a mix of the share wins that we have seen very specifically in the U.K. and the secular shift. So we feel very well positioned in Europe. One thing to add here, I'm just looking at my phone here, can you imagine in the conference call, but it was the reporting of the quarter 1 GDV numbers. And if you look into that, there is -- the consumer does stand out positively. So the resilience even in that number is reflected. I think -- the point on that I mentioned earlier on the impact of stresses on the banking sector. That's another one that we did talk about. And here, if you think about what does this mean in terms of potentially additional regulation, what it means in terms of credit appetite for banks and self-host. Those are all not near-term effects that we're -- we can judge at this point in time.  So some of the outlook that we are taking here is a near-term outlook for the year, and we'll have to see how things develop over time. Again, flexibility and agility is critical. And so we feel ready for all of that. Harshita, let me start on this. So first on the competitive landscape. As Sachin was saying earlier, our services strategy is closely tied in with our payment strategy. So we're not your average service competitor as in a cybersecurity company that competes with a bunch of other cybersecurity companies. We are somewhere in the middle between bolts and being in the flow gives us additional data points that makes us a fairly unique competitive landscape for us, which is why we like the combination of both.  But it's very specifically on cybersecurity. You have a whole set of specialty players Bath & Bay was a specialty player and yet, we're dealing in threat protection. As we were ourselves with Risk Recon before, it's just a slightly different angle of that. So we are very aware of the wide competitive landscape here, but our position, I think, sets us apart. Now there's other potential comes closer to the payment space. So looking at services as well. So we're trying to keep our services set differentiated and ahead of the curve. It's the same thing for data and services. Yet again, a lot of data and SaaS companies that are building their businesses.  But on the other hand, we have a captive set of customers today, and we have a captive set of transactions of these customers that these companies want to understand and where do they come to an integrated provider that helps them with both. So that's, again, a unique position for us. To look at, I think dynamic yield and how we're combining that with our data set, as I referred to my earlier remarks, I think it's an excellent example of that. So that's the competitive landscape that we're looking at. It's a fast-moving one. So we have -- we will continue to have that in focus. So hard to predict, but the fact is capacity isn't fully back. So that's one important aspect when we gave you the outlook later on. Right, David. So let me take a look at that. Conversations in Europe have been going on for years on ACH systems. As you know, when the U.K. was part of the EU, I don't even know if it's Europe right now or not, but we invested in Vocalink. So we have a counter account systems in Europe for a long time. We're having some stakes in other P2P systems on the continent and so forth.  The most late -- the most recent development here is the announcement around the European payment initiative, which is yet another effort in account to account. Europe is the land of domestic systems and domestic payment solutions. It's a very versatile competitive landscape, and there is more coming. We have found ways to partner. We have found ways to compete. And in the case of EPI, we are partnering with the owner banks to push our solutions.  At the same time, we'll have to see where EPI goes, and then we stand ready to engage one way or another depending on their willingness. As you can see, Europe has been a source of share growth for us and revenue growth. So we know how to play this environment. Right. So India is a hugely important market for us. We have a large number of our employees based in India, serving the Indian market as well as other markets in Asia, deep engagements with customers there. It's interesting when you look at the market from where it has gone under the lead of India's government, they've built a tremendous digital economy. So the India tech stack has really opened up the digital economy at a much, much different scale than before, and we like that. That gives you opportunities for us to engage with our customers to many more Indian citizens. So we generally see that opportunity. It's also true, though, that today, every day solution around debit and credit matter. And we have -- now we reached -- we're back to pre-embargo growth on the issuing side with our customers in India. So that is looking very, very positive. We're back in the market there.  So we're playing both of that. It's a market where we'll see more innovation coming from us of the folks that are based there. So there isn't a financial inclusion opportunity. There's an everyday opportunity in credit and debit and it's not the most populous country in the world. So it's going to be the theatre of the future, and we're excited to be involved there. Where is all the engagement going with the India tech stack? What does it mean for our cards? And how will cards be linked into UPI and so forth? The details have yet to be seen, but we're active in those conversations. And in the end, when we have an opportunity to partner, then we will try to do that. I think we have time for one more caller. Right, Jason. So here, the opportunity, I wouldn't really point to a particular geography. I think generally, the set of countries that have a lower digitization rate is a tremendous opportunity for us. We have learned how to drive digitization. Just look at Latin America, you take like a country like Mexico, a tremendous opportunity in terms of driving digitization up. And part of that we have seen in Brazil. So you can start to make those comparisons and you add that up across the wood that is a tremendous opportunity. In terms of large-scale country opportunities, we just talked about India and certainly not in the category of emerging markets, but China is a market that we are very engaged on today in the cross-border business, and you do know that we have a license application out there to participate in the domestic market and we stand ready to invest forward with the Chinese consumers and businesses. So we'll see where that one goes. I do have final comments. So I've made it a habit to thank the 30,000 people at Mastercard for what they did, what they all do. And I shall do that again for this quarter. I thought it was a good quarter, and it is reflective of their work. But I do want to thank you as well, Warren. So it's been fun three years for me and previously with Ajay. So thank you for everything that you did. I know we all talk about you. I do want to talk about Devon as well. So if you could picture us here in this room, here's Devon, and we're looking forward Sachin and I to work with you. And I do want to say, Warren has -- you have built a tremendous set of relationships with the folks on the call. And I look to those folks on the call, first of all, thanking you guys for your support, but also to give Devon, the same kind of support that you have in the past. With that, thank you very much and speak to you one quarter from now."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Incorporated Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Brianna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and joining remotely is Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our Web site for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning everyone. On Halloween, well, nothing spooky here. The headline this quarter, again, we delivered strong results across all aspects of our business. We\u2019re adding to that momentum with the announcement of two planned acquisitions, Recorded Future and Minna Technologies. In the third quarter, net revenues were up 14%, and adjusted net income increased 13% versus a year-ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were underpinned by healthy consumer spending, including strong cross-border volume growth of 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. And value-added services and solutions net revenue grew 19% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. The macroeconomic environment remained supportive, and continues to underpin the strength in consumer spending. The labor market remained strong, even if slightly below historically tight levels. And inflation has moderated, albeit at varied levels across categories and countries. Overall, we remain positive about our growth outlook, but we will continue to monitor the environment. We will continue to focus on the things we can control, and execute on our growth algorithm. By tapping into the sizable secular shift opportunity to electronic payments, and that across both spend and transactions. Also, by further penetrating the addressable market in commercial and new payment flows, by gaining market share, and by growing value-added services and solutions. Let\u2019s take a look at our progress in these four areas, starting with the shift to digital. There\u2019s still a long runway for the secular shift for person to merchant payments. Our diverse global footprint and innovative digital-first proposition enable us to maximize this opportunity. A key driver is acceptance, which we have effectively doubled over the last five years. We are increasing acceptance by digitizing untapped pools of spend in areas, like transit, to open up new transaction flows. Over the years, we have helped hundreds of transit systems around the world move to open loop. And now, our contact-less technology is making it easier for international travelers in Beijing and people in Hong Kong can now seamlessly pay for their train trips. The shift to digital means turning every device into an acceptance device. Just think about that. Tap-on-phone is now live in over 110 markets. Since the beginning of this year, the number of tap-on-phone locations almost doubled. And more than 10% are net new acceptance locations for Mastercard. You see it everywhere, at food trucks in major cities, at the farmers\u2019 market in my town, in the air to make in-flight purchases, and at sporting events like the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. We\u2019re adding more access through acceptance efforts. In Africa, we\u2019re partnering to make our QR pay-by-link technology available to every merchant with a KaiOS-powered phone, that\u2019s putting affordable ways to be paid in the hands of underserved small businesses across the whole continent. We\u2019re investing in cutting-edge technologies, like tokenization and pass keys to make the online shopping experience better and more secure. And that\u2019s the expectation people have when they see our brand. They know it\u2019s convenient, fast, and frictionless. And that ease and simplicity are not sacrificed for world-class security and protection against fraud. They get all that from Mastercard in every transaction. Efforts like these are being developed by our teams across the globe, including at our newly expanded tech hub, in Pune, India, where I was earlier this month. India is where we first launched the Mastercard payment pass key service, which replaces the need for passwords or texts for one-time pass codes with biometrics; simple and seamless ways to address the high levels of fraud and the need for secure payments everywhere, no matter the channel. We\u2019re extending and scaling that into new markets with partners like noon Payments, one of the largest PSPs in Middle East Africa. We\u2019re also collaborating with India\u2019s leading wearables brand, Bolt. We will work with them to enable quick, highly secured tokenized contact-less payments on their devices. The continued adoption of these capabilities positions us well to capture the large secular opportunity in consumer payments. Now, the consumer is one part of the story. There\u2019s a sizable opportunity in unlocking new flows across commercial payments and disbursement and remittances. We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in these spaces. In commercial, we have the right solutions, and we\u2019re expanding into new verticals with specialized partners who offer significant reach. Last quarter, we announced the partnership with CBC to provide car distribution, acceptance and financial education to almost two million retailers. We\u2019re now building on this momentum with a partnership with payment orchestrator, Yallo. They work with some of the largest consumer packaged goods distributors in Latin America, including Nestl\u00e9, Mondelez, and Coca-Cola. This partnership will enable three million small and medium-sized customers to use Mastercard small business cards to make purchases. And in the healthcare industry, we\u2019re partnering with Fundbot, a fintech specializing in supply chain financing. We will work with them to capture additional B2B flows with virtual cards and address insurance payment delays that have historically posed challenged. Now shifting to disbursements and remittances, we\u2019re also scaling with important players in that space. You saw our announcement at Mastercard Move, we\u2019ll be integrated into Citi\u2019s cross-border payments network. Citi customers in 65 countries can now make secure near real-time cross-border payment transfers to Mastercard debt cards in 14 receiving markets worldwide with more to come early next year. In the U.S., we have expanded our partnership with payment platform processor Astra Inc. to accelerate the adoption of Mastercard Move for push-to-card payments. In Latin America, we announced partnerships with Paysend, Leap Financial, and Felix Pago to tackle the significant U.S. and Latin America cross-border corridor opportunity. Another important element of our growth algorithm is gaining more share of the carded market. And we are, even in today\u2019s competitive marketplace, we do this by understanding our customers\u2019 needs and by offering differentiated service that can help them and drive value and/or choice to the end customer. For example, this quarter, in Belgium, Brussels Airlines announced that they will migrate their co-brand card and loyalty program to Mastercard. We extended our agreement with the second largest bank in Europe, BNP Paribas Group. The extension includes additional services such as launch pads to co-create new digital experiences through our dedicated innovation hub. We\u2019re building on our partnership with one of the largest commercial banks in Qatar; Doha Bank. In addition to renewing debit and prepaid, they will migrate the majority of their credit program to Mastercard. They were also the first bank in Qatar to launch our cross-border payment services. We\u2019re teaming up with Alibaba.com to enable their first co-branded U.S. small business credit card. And we signed an exclusive partnership with Mobitel\u2019s mobile wallet: e-Mola, in Mozambique. To me, all these reinforce Mastercard is a valued partner to our customers. Last quarter, I highlighted the progress we\u2019re making against the significant opportunity in Africa. Today, let\u2019s focus on Latin America, a diverse region that embraces new technologies and represents a large untapped opportunity to convert cash and check to electronic forms of payment. External sources estimate that more than 60% of purchase transactions in Latin America are still paid in cash and check. We have been striving strong growth in the region with third quarter year-to-day GDV up 19% year-over-year on a local currency basis. And we are working locally to win share. We\u2019re growing with two of the largest banks in Guatemala. Banco G&T Continental will migrate the majority of their debit portfolio to Mastercard. And Banco Industrial will drive new MasterCard credit and debit issuance, and use us as the network provider for their neobank. In El Salvador, Banco Agricola has agreed to migrate their debit portfolio to Mastercard and drive new credit issuance. The leading credit issuer in Uruguay, OSEA, has renewed our agreement and will convert a private label portfolio to Mastercard. We also have excellent merchant partnerships in Latin America. In Chile, we\u2019re securing our position as the market leader with retail issuing partners. We extended our card issuing partnership with the second largest merchant in Chile, Cencosud. We renewed our exclusive card issuing partnership with Banco Ripley, the financial institution of Ripley Corp, one of the largest retail conglomerates in Chile and Peru. This snapshot of Latin America shows more examples of how we continue to win and retain customer agreements around the globe. Now, turning to value-add services and solutions. Our strong growth here is supported by strong differentiated products, transaction flows, and customer demands. And we aren\u2019t stopping here. We are investing in new products to further expand our addressable market and address the needs of our customers. Let\u2019s start with cybersecurity. We play a critical role advancing trust in securing a global digital ecosystem before, during, and after a transaction. Our agreement to acquire Recorded Future is expected to add threat intelligence capabilities to our leading identity solutions, real-time fraud scoring, and cybersecurity services. The company provides real-time visibility into potential threats through differentiated AI-powered solutions. This enables customers to act on and mitigate risks before they occur. We can enhance these solutions with the addition of Mastercard Insights product. This planned addition is expected to make our cybersecurity value proposition stronger, open up cross-sell opportunities with new customers, and add to our addressable market. Another trend is the growth of the subscription economy. Subscriptions are everywhere; delivery, entertainment, shopping, software, healthcare, and much more. They play a big role in people\u2019s lives and are supported by and help grow digital payments. With that, comes an increasing demand for more transparency and control from consumers as well as regulators. That\u2019s why we have agreed to acquire Minna Technologies. Their payment scheme agnostic services go beyond insights. It enables consumers, like those today with Capital One, to easily modify, extend, or cancel subscriptions directly within their banking applications and websites. And merchants benefit from the ability to re-engage their customers. The technology will also add to our broader set of tools like consumer clarity to enhance the overall value we deliver, including helping merchants build long-term deeper relationships with consumers through loyalty, rewards, and personalized offers. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about creating a win-win approach for all involved; merchants, banks, and consumers. The expectation from consumers for personalized experiences also continues to grow. To meet this demand, we acquired best-in-class personalization assets in 2022 by Dynamic Yield. Since then, we have enriched the consumer-consented personalization experience with insights from our data analytics. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had a lot of success scaling with around 500 retail and commerce partners, including luxury hospitality conglomerate in the Middle East, Kerzner. And now, we have introduced a new solution for issuing banks called Personalization Breeze. It combines our market-leading personalization offering with our propensity modeling to send individualized messages to cardholders. This is a fantastic example of the value we can deliver when we combine the proposition of our acquisitions, data, and other service offerings. Now, one of those offerings is open banking. It\u2019s no surprise. People want greater choice, control, and access to financial services. And banks want faster and more efficient processes. Our open banking technology can deliver all that. We recently announced enhancements to our open banking lending program. Through our partnership with Argyle, lenders can now verify income and employment through consumer-permission payroll data. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have authorized this as a data source. And we work with them to provide asset verification, rent history, and cash flow assessment data during the mortgage underwriting process. This means a streamlined and informed lending process, especially for those with low, thin, or no credit files. We continue to add to, enhance our value-added services and solutions. We provide differentiated value at scale across a diverse set of payment-adjacent areas; cybersecurity, fraud, marketing, personalization, and insights to name a few. All with large addressable markets where we have the right to play, win, and scale, and all that while driving the positive flywheel effect where payments and services reinforce each other. Today\u2019s call is a look at the past quarter. We have accomplished how we continue to set ourselves up for the future. We deliver it again across all facets of the business. And there\u2019s so much opportunity ahead. We look forward to diving into this and more at our investment community meeting on November 13. Now, Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 14%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 12%. And operating income was up 15%. Net income and EPS increased 13% and 16% respectively, primarily reflecting the strong operating income growth in the third quarter. EPS was $3.89, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $983 million through October 28th, 2024. Let\u2019s turn to page four, where I\u2019ll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the third quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 8%. Credit and debit growth was aided by the conversions of the previously announced Wells Fargo commercial credit and citizens\u2019 debit migrations respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 14%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. Turning to page five, switch transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q3. Both card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents approximately 70% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to slide six for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 11% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 19% primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand for our consulting and marketing services, the scaling of our fraud and security, and our identity and authentication solutions, and pricing. Now, let\u2019s turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV also grew 10%. Cross-border assessments increased 22%, while cross-border volumes increased 17%. The five-ppt difference is primarily driven by pricing in international markets and mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 14%, while switched transactions grew 11%. The three-ppt difference is primarily due to mix and pricing. Other network assessments were $227 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchisees, and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12%. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, including planned increased spending in advertising and marketing, as well an increase in indirect access, as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. Turning to page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trends. Our Switch metrics in Q3 and through the first four weeks of October remained generally stable sequentially, both in the U.S. and across the globe as spending remained healthy. Of note, in the U.S., a portion of the uptick in switched volumes in the first four weeks of October was related to certain events, including the mix of high-volume calendar days and the tightening of social security payments this year as compared to last year. Turning now to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. As Michael said, consumer spending remained healthy, and we delivered across all aspects of our business in Q3. We remain well-positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by our diversified business model, the significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment in both consumer and commercial, and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions. While we continue to monitor the economic headwinds and tailwinds, we remain focused on executing on our strategy. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. Now, turning to Q4 2024, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low-teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact on this growth rate, while we expect a zero to one PPT headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expense growth to be the high end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this reflects higher spending in advertising and marketing in Q4, as compared to Q3, primarily driven by the cadence of spend related to our sponsorship activities. Acquisitions and FX are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this OpEx growth for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses, in Q4, we expect an expense of approximately $85 million. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue, and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% for Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. A further comment on tax, there\u2019s now more clarity on the potential impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules as more countries continue to enact these rules. As disclosed in our 10-K, we have an incentive grant in Singapore. Starting in 2025, we expect the new Pillar Two global minimum tax rules will offset the benefit of this incentive brand. For reference, Q3 year-to-date 2024, this benefit had the impact of reducing our tax rate by approximately 4%. On a personal note, I\u2019d like to thank all of you for the well-wishes I\u2019ve received over the last several weeks. I feel good and happy to be here speaking with you today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Devin.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Sachin. Brianna, you may open the call up for questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well, Sachin. Just a quick question on the U.S. volume uptick, I know you mentioned some of it was related to some of those items that you mentioned. But is the rest of it just consumer picking up steam a little bit, and I\u2019m just curious how, through your data, you\u2019ve seen the consumer behave in a lower-rate environment, that\u2019s rated so lower do consumers spend more?\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Sanjay, thanks for the question. Hopefully, can you hear me? Look, I mean the consumer continues to be healthy. We continue to see positive trends from a consumer health standpoint. They\u2019re spending in a very healthy manner. So, that\u2019s the underlying basis for what you\u2019re seeing for our Q3 metrics, as well as what you\u2019re seeing in the first four weeks of October. I will caution and say these are first four weeks of October, so they don\u2019t make the quarter. But that being said, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the consumer continues to show strength. But beyond that, like I mentioned, in the first four weeks, we cannot ignore the fact that there were certain one-time items such as the calendarization impact, which I mentioned, and the timing of social security payments which kind of caused that little bump that you see in U.S. metrics take place. But net-net, here\u2019s the story, that the reality is, overall, with employment continuing to remain strong with interest rates starting to come down -- well, actually, technically, that there were reductions in the Fed-driven interest rates, but we\u2019ve seen that the yield curve has actually gone right back up. But the reality is there continues to be confidence from a consumer standpoint. We\u2019ve seen that come through, and it certainly came through in their spending patterns as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey, great, thanks. And Sachin, I knew you wouldn\u2019t miss delivering these results. I wanted to ask, for Michael, I like your discussion of acceptance, and the trends and the growth, and the benefits there, can you give us -- [technical difficulty] or maybe for tokenization, and where we are with respect to penetration, growth, benefits to the ecosystem and, of course, benefits to Mastercard\u2019s P&L?\nSachin Mehra: Right. So, tokenization cutting-edge technology, as I call it, we\u2019ve been investing it for years. We\u2019re in the billions of tractions now. The benefit of tokenization is pretty clear. It helps on the security side. The tokenized transaction has -- always a more secure transaction as the data will be only available for one-time use. That drives adoption across the ecosystem on the basis of higher securities. This has been rapidly around the world. We are in a whole range of markets around the world today. And it doesn\u2019t end at security, there\u2019s benefit that is coming to merchants from tokenization as there are higher conversion rates, and online commerce, for example. So, disability for us is -- cannot be underestimated. So, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in it. There is a set of base functionality around tokenization as security, as I explained. There will be other solutions that we can tag on to that, for example, toke lifecycle management, and so forth. Now, we have been investing for many years in this capability. And, of course, we see this as an opportunity for us to drive our revenue line, and charge for that, but it\u2019s very clearly related to and direct upside that our customer see, is our merchant from higher conversion or lower fraud on the securities side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Sachin, and I hope you\u2019re feeling better. Michael, I wanted to ask about Mastercard value-added services, specifically in cybersecurity. You made a number of investments here, including the recent recorded future deals. If I look at your large disclosure from three years ago, cyber and intelligence with $3.7 billion in revenues for you already back then, can you talk about how it's being sold to clients? Is it an attached on a transaction or increasingly kind of like a new adjacency for Mastercard where you're studying synergy from the data on the platform and selling beyond just Mastercard transactions? Thank you.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So, when I look at our value-added service portfolios, our security solutions is a very significant share of that. Why is that? Because the world is digitizing more, there's an increasing need to secure those transactions. That's a tremendous underlying secular trend for us to be involved with. It's a huge addressable market. So, we build out a set of transaction related solutions over the years before the transaction, after the transaction. One of the more recent ones that we talked about that we invested heavily in using our Brighterion acquisition from back in 2017 to use our AI capabilities is decision intelligence. We've now boosted the product with Gen AI and the outcome that we see is tremendous. This is up to a 20% lift that we see. Now, these are solutions that our customers opt into because they like those solutions and they like the lift that they get out of that. As I was saying earlier in the prepared remarks is we're not stopping here. Clearly, cybersecurity risk doesn't stop at the transaction. It goes beyond the transaction. It goes into reacting to cybersecurity risk that you see in your business that goes beyond fraud, aware of those vulnerabilities. You recall our RiskRecon acquisition from a few years ago. Again, those are services that our customers buy from us because they feel they are under threat and they want to step up their defenses. Now, recorded future, this is a subscription-based service into threat intelligence, which is the next logical step to go even further and look even further ahead and see what threat is coming my way. So, we have a natural position in here. It starts with the transaction, but we're selling these services way beyond the transaction. We've been historically on the record to say about 50% of our services are somehow related to transactions, but the other 50% are not and we're building out that portfolio with recorded future being one example. We're very excited about that. Threat intelligence, if you look at the customer set of recorded future, it's very impressive and we're looking forward to bringing those into the fold as and when the approval process ends.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nRayna Kumar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We saw some volume acceleration in Europe, which is your largest geography in the quarter. What are you seeing in terms of macro in the region as well as potential for further share gains? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, Rayna. Thanks for your question. So, look, I mean, Europe is clearly a very important region. We continue to perform well in that region. What we're seeing from a macro standpoint, and you've probably seen this in the most recent economic data, is you're starting to see positive trends come through there with momentum in France and Spain, and even in Germany. The reality is, Europe has kind of been a little bit of a tale of two cities. You've had Northern Europe, and then you have Southern Europe. Southern Europe has been actually performing well for the longest time. And now you're starting to see some momentum come through in other parts of Europe as well. So, net-net, I would tell you, the consumer confidence continues to improve, unemployment remains low. And so, from a macro standpoint you're in a good place from a European standpoint. As it relates to Mastercard's business in Europe, a couple of factors, there still remains a tremendous secular opportunity in Europe. We're tapping into that. We continue to actually be performing well on that basis, which is why you're seeing that come through in our drivers. And then, even beyond that, going back to the growth algorithm, which Michael was speaking about earlier, we continue to win share. I mean, the reality is what you're seeing come through in the nature of the drivers is the conversions of the UniCredit portfolio. You're seeing that come through in the nature of the Deutsche Bank portfolio. These are ones we've talked about in the past. You're just starting to see that come through in the metrics now. And also, we continue to be very focused on our efforts for migrating from Maestro to Debit Mastercard. And you're seeing all of that come through in the metrics. So, net-net, very important region; the economy seems to be holding up well, and in some cases showing renewed signs of improvement. And then, our business there, both from a secular and a market share standpoint that this should perform well. I noted such and that you said, even in Germany. I wouldn't miss my chance on that, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about incentives, there's a little bit of a debate going on. Is incentives rising? Is there more renewals going on currently that are going to push incentives higher? Just like to get your thoughts around that. And glad you're feeling well, Sachin.\nSachin Mehra: Thank you. Look, I mean, the reality is, from a competitive environment standpoint, the market continues to be competitive. We continue to compete in this environment. Nothing, from our perspective, is vastly different from what was there already a year ago or two years ago. The reality is we'll continue to compete here. From an incentive standpoint, you're very well aware that in order to actually win volume, you're going to have to incentivize customers, which is what we do. And then, when you win the volume, you have the ability to generate revenues from the volume in question, optimize those portfolios, grow them at a faster pace, and then deliver services, which helps us increase our net value yield. Really, the playbook is very much the same, and from a competitive environment standpoint, not much is changing on that front.\nMichael Miebach: And you see us winning. If you look at some of the movements here in the United States recently on the debit side, there is, on the basis of our differentiated propositions, we keep winning, so that resonates. We keep investing in that, as I just spoke about, but it's also pretty clear in that competitive environment where we hope to have the better solution for our customers in the end consumer. There is not every deal is for us and we don't want to win every deal. There is competitive movement in different parts of the world and we are very thoughtful about that. There is financial discipline. In the end, what we keep in mind is the net revenue yield.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Chiodo. Your line is open.\nTim Chiodo: Great, thank you for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit on Mastercard Move, so the combination of Mastercard Send and the Cross-Border Services. Two brief topics, one around mix. Across that entire capability, would you describe the cross-border mix as similar, higher, or lower than the rest of Mastercard's business? And then, in terms of the accounting for the revenues, I believe, and maybe you could correct me, that any of the domestic-related activity tends to be a little bit more card-based, so it's sitting within payment network. And some of the cross-border activity, some at least, is more account-to-account and would be within Dash net. Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: All right. So, maybe I start on that. So, these are very different and complementary businesses. I think that's the first to think about. So, obviously we have a thriving cross-border driven part of our carded business and the P2M space. We make something very complex across border, pretty simple for consumers. That's a good starting point, but there's many other use cases that are not actually happening through PODS today and as part of our one-stop strategy for payments for years, we have been investing in going after those flows and having a differentiated proposition there. So, Mastercard Move, which has domestic and cross-border type of payments, currently what we see here is this is a pretty differentiated reach that we have across 95% of the world's bank population, 180 countries, 150 currencies, that's a very different proposition. There are kind of use cases that you think about, think insurance distribution, gig workers that work remotely and develop an application for another company somewhere else around the world. So, it's a pain point for many companies how to do this effectively and at attractive price and our growth rates tell us that we're having a right proposition out there. In the third quarter, we're seeing over 40% of transaction growth in this business. So, differentiated solution and I come back to the announcement with Citi here. So, Citi is a strong player in cross-border and here this is one plus one is three as we have more endpoints and starting points for a transaction that we can bring into this partnership.\nMichael Miebach: And then, on your question around the accounting, you have it right, I mean, the stuff which is on card rails, for example, domestic send, related revenues, send and payment network, and then the cross-border volumes, which flow on non-card rails are sitting in our value-added services and solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. Sachin, first of all, I just want to reiterate, it's great to hear you on the call again. Guys, I just want to start off first. I mean, the yield and the spread and what we're seeing in growth of transaction revenues and cross-border, continuing to outperform the KPIs, I think it just shows the value add you're bringing to your customers. Can you just touch on the expansion of that and what kind of opportunities you're seeing taken on by the customers to allow you to have those better yields relative to the volumetrics, so just basically incremental VAS or services or even pricing. And then, Sachin, just a quick follow-up on tax rate, I think you said four points, so just want to be clear, we should be expecting around 20% tax rate next year? Thanks.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. So, sure, Darrin. Thanks for your question. So, let me take the tax rate question first, and I'll come back to your question around what you're seeing in terms of yield trends. So, on the tax rate look, now we see greater clarity as it relates to the implementation of this bill of two global minimum tax. And what we thought, and you've seen this in our 10K disclosures in the past that we've had this incentive agreement with Singapore. The reality is now Singapore has actually enacted those rules. There's one final step which is left to be done in Singapore, but the reality is it's getting pretty close. So, what we wanted to do was help our investors understand the impact of Q3 year-to-date that we had experienced as a result of these incentive plans from Singapore on our tax rate. And that's that four percentage number which I kind of shared with you. I can't tell you exactly what our tax rate is going to look like on a going forward basis, but order of magnitude, right, the impact of not getting the incentive grant in Singapore this year would have had an impact about four points on our tax rate. So, I wanted to get that clarity out for the investor community on that. On the first part of your question, which is around yields, look, we're very pleased with the value we're delivering to our customers, whether it's in cross-border, whether it's in domestic, whether it's through the services we bring. And the reality is what you're seeing come through is, I think you were talking about the spread between the driver metric and the revenue metric here, look, there are a number of factors which go into this, right? So, for example, on the transaction processing side, you can see the impact of mix come through. And this is a mix from both a cross-border and domestic standpoint when you're comparing the driver trend with the revenue trend, but it's also geographical mix, depending on which geographies are going faster and which geographies are going slower. So, you've got to take those factors into consideration. We certainly do when we're running the business. We look, like Michael said, we're not looking to win every portfolio. We want to win the right portfolios in the right regions with the fastest growth opportunity, which have the best yield. Because at the end of the day, what we're trying to optimize is driving that yield up. And that's what you're seeing come through in my comments around the mixed spread, which is there both on cross-border as well as in transaction processing. The other factor I'll point out is in the third quarter, you did get a little bit of a lift come through from FX volatility. Now, that sits in our transaction processing assessments line item. That is very hard to predict. I will tell you right now, FX volatility is running at record low levels over the last few weeks. So, it's a little bit of what we can do to enable the yield, which is what we do by delivering good value, good products, good services, as well as winning the right portfolios. And then, there's a little bit of stuff which happens from a macro standpoint, such as FX yield, et cetera, et cetera, which kind of plays into that. So, hopefully, Darrin, that gives you a little bit of color as to how we're trying to optimize the mix between what we're seeing from a driver trend standpoint and what we're seeing from an overall assessment revenue standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to dig in a little bit into B2B and commercial volumes. I think there's been good and steady progress there over the years, including this year. But at the same time, a lot of us are surprised that there hasn't been an acceleration. So, I'm just wondering kind of how you would assess that situation and what are the tools and capabilities of Mastercard? We should think about that Mastercard is bringing the market to help accelerate that market, or you think this is going to continue to be the cadence that we should expect, that it'll be steadily contributing to growth, but it just takes time? Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you. Great question. One of my favorite topics to talk about commercial, earlier, I spoke about the tremendous secular opportunity we see in consumer, and then build on that and said, what is an even bigger opportunity in commercial? So we like it for those reasons. As I commented on previous calls, there were various structural issues over the years why this hasn't really unlocked in emerging markets, there were issues that we're not familiar with the risk. There wasn't technology that was available in back offices of smaller companies and so on and so on. If you pass forward to today, we're seeing a situation where this the momentum feels solid. We're seeing 11% growth in commercial. And that's good. And that's above consumer. And that's we like that. So, when I look ahead and say, what should we expect going forward? I'm not going to give you an outlook right now. Maybe you should dial into the Investor Day in a little while. But the point here is, we see our ability to put out solutions with different partners more globally into the back office systems of companies, our partnership with Oracle and SAP, for example, we see a whole new generation of treasurers that are digitally minded and businesses that are having an expectation that their digital lives in the office should be not worse than their digital lives and their personal lives. So, when we put out our mobile based T&E card proposition, then people are saying that it's cool. We like that. So, there is definitely changes happening. The most significant change that I see is really the interest of our issuing partners around the world to start to see this is a proposition to go into. I can talk to my customer about the working capital effect of a virtual card as part of their payment. That's 30 days of working capital. That is a real winning argument that everybody can understand, including our issuers getting very excited about. So, we see this as a space that's going to continue and drive growth for us. And you saw our reorganization where we align behind commercial and new payment flows because we believe it's going to be a tremendous growth driver.\nSachin Mehra: Hey, I'll just quickly jump in and clarify when Michael talked about the 11% growth rate on commercial, he was talking about the currency neutral growth rate for the third quarter of this year. Just want to be sure that we have that.\nMichael Miebach: Sachin, thank you for clarifying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Maurer: Hi, thanks, and good to hear you, Sachin. I want -- there's a lot of discussion around VAS and it's difficult for us to really get under the covers on that too much, but wanted to ask you, Michael, if you could characterize perhaps where you think Mastercard is better than your closest competitors in VAS when you're presenting to an issuer or merchant and it allows you to win that business. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So, value-added services and solutions, it's been a true differentiator for Mastercard for the last seven years at least. And we anchored around two fundamental points. I talked about one earlier, which is in a digitizing world, keeping that digital ecosystem in a company or in a consumer context or a bank context safe. So, our security solutions have been a differentiator and I think it's a truly differentiated proposition. The second big underlying trend here is with a highly and a rapidly digitizing world, more and more data becomes available and a lot of more businesses want to make sense of that data. So, this is another powerful trend. So, the second leg of this tool was we're building out a set of data insights solutions. So, that is the general proposition. Now, if you look under the hood of that, to your point there isn't much of a hood under look under the hood that you have. Well, I think we actually did share quite a bit of that over the years. So, on the security side, it's before the transaction, during the transaction, after the transaction, that's our digital identity solutions before. Those are per click solutions where we provide data to give an identity score to somebody that wants to find out, is this the real customer? And then, all the way to our fraud scoring solutions directly linked to the payments, all of that. So, that is pretty known. And on the data insight solution here again, it is a whole set of solutions that help customers that could be a merchant, that could be a bank to engage their customers, their end consumers in a better way through campaign management solutions, test and learn through marketing services, through loyalty and so forth. They are all very different business models, some of them subscription based, some of them per transaction clicks in a very different way. So, all of it, it's a whole mix. The point of all of this is two powerful underlying trends. And within each of these solutions, you have an arc where all of these solutions build on top of each other. They are finely and clearly curated for us to provide an end-to-end solution. So, I can say to our customer, I don't have this widget and that widget for you. I have a solution that can allow you to run your business better. Our engagement is always to help our customers drive their top line. And that's what we do. This is a different proposition than maybe others have out there. We like that because that makes us a strategic partner for our customers, for our customers. Overall, we believe this is differentiated. You've seen strong growth for us for years. You've seen another set of strong numbers for this quarter. And it's been boosting the revenue of the company and our yield.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. With the Q4 outlook for low teens growth, if we think about that as the stepping off point for '25, is there anything in that fourth quarter growth that we should be mindful of either working for or against you that might not carry into next year or that a reasonable baseline for us to use as we start to think about '25? Thanks very much.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. So, first of all we'll talk about '25 at the right time, but let me give you a little bit of color and things to think about between what you're seeing in 2024 and 2025, right? Obviously, you guys know about the leap year effect. And I know you're asking a few poor questions, but more broadly speaking, you've got the leap year effect taking place in 2024. You're not going to have that in 2025. The things which you've got to keep in mind are, number one, we've had significant share wins, which have started to actually roll on in 2024. So, we talked a little bit about the citizens win. We talked a little bit about the Wells Fargo win. We talked about UniCredit, Deutsche Bank. Now, these will lap and the lapping effect of this will come through four quarters after they typically come on our books. So, for example, take something like the Wells Fargo commercial credit win. That was completely migrated onto Mastercard in the second quarter, second quarter of this year, 2024. So, you'll see the lapping effect of that come through in 2025. Similarly, as it relates to citizens, the vast majority of the ramp up on citizens took place in Q2 of 2024 with a little tail effect in Q3. So, you'll see that again lap off in 2025. So, I want to kind of just make sure that you've got that as a line of sight element. The other element is around pricing, right? I mean we've talked a little bit about some of the pricing actions which we've taken for all the innovation investments that we've been doing as a company. You're going to see the lapping effect of that come through as well. So, these are a couple of things which I would keep in mind as you go in from 2024 to 2025. But we'll talk in more detail about '25 at the right time over the next few months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nJamie Friedman: Let me echo my warm wishes, Sachin. I wanted to ask about China, if I may. You obviously have high ambitions there and are well positioned and you've had some significant developments on the operating side. So, I was just wondering how you're performing relative to your expectations as you roll out in China.\nSachin Mehra: Thank you. So, you mentioned it, I think, in the July call, you said we're alive now in China. So, we're alive as of May with a whole number of issuers and we're alive in China with a very unique proposition, which is a single use card that can be used domestically as well as cross-border. We've been in China for a long time, but that was a cross-border only use case. Now, this single proposition is a card that gives full global acceptance and it gives increasing domestic acceptance through a combination of measures. One is some of the local QR wallets that you can load your card into so you can benefit from that acceptance. And then, we're busy investing in acceptance across the country. There's interest from the Chinese government to link their economy more closely to the global economy. So, they're keen on building out acceptance so that people who travel into China can use cards as they would normally anywhere else in the world. Now, we're excited about the opportunity for a number of reasons. It's a huge economy, obviously, and we want to participate. So, that is a significant secular opportunity for us as we invest in this market. And this is regardless of up and down of the overall economy in China. This is a share situation. It's a secular opportunity as a starting point. But it will take investment. It will take investment. It will take time. Coming back to the acceptance part, issuing is a little easier to solve, but without acceptance, then that's going to be hard to do. So, we will continue to focus on that. As you know, we have a joint venture there and we have our own set of activities in China through services and so forth, which we continue that we have always done in China. So, exciting opportunity, medium to long term, the fact that we are in China does make us now the most accepted payment solution in the world and that is a differentiating factor for us as we look ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Fahed Kunwar with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nFahed Kunwar: Hi, thanks, and also part of my well wishes to Sachin as well. Love to get just a bit more on price and we've touched on it a few times over these questions, but you've obviously taken pricing, I think, on cross-border and elements of that. But is there more room for pricing increases? And if we were looking across your stack and suite of products, where do you see that kind of potential for pricing more for value? Thank you.\nSachin Mehra: Sorry, just want to make sure. Can you hear me, Fahed?\nFahed Kunwar: Yes.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Okay. I'm looking at the end of the day. Yes. Yes. I just want to be sure you can hear me. Look, at the end of the day, I think the way you should think about our philosophy along both our investments as well as how we drive remuneration from those investments is unchanged. We've always been in the business of investing heavily in driving innovation. As we drive innovation, we deliver value to our customers and to our merchants and consumers. And like with every other business, when you make investments, you want to realize the value for that. And that's what we talk about in the nature of pricing. And that's what we do. So, nothing's changed philosophically. I would tell you in terms of how we're running the business there, you can see that year-over-year, we look to make investments from an OpEx standpoint for all the investments we're doing in our people to drive our strategic initiatives that comes up with value propositions, which allows us to price for them. And that's really the way we're executing on our business. I would tell you that if you think about our business, broadly speaking, you should think about it as no different than in the past, right? On the one hand, we're operating in a very competitive market where you're seeing us compete for winning important portfolios. When you do that, you pay rebates and incentives. So, we like to think about pricing in the context of net pricing, which is net of the compression we take on rebates and incentives. And we continue to still see that environment as one where we have minimal net pricing, which is the combination of what we do in the nature of investments and the reiteration we derive for it, net of what we have to do in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. So, it's a combination of both of those factors which we're balancing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question this morning. Michael, I was wondering if you could give us your reaction to the DOJ antitrust suit against Visa. Comment on whether you see a potential opportunity for Mastercard if the legal and regulatory kind of pressure faced by your competitor ends up shifting some market share around.\nMichael Miebach: Right. Ramsey, thanks for the question. So, obviously, we all read the headlines, we saw that allegations have been made. Obviously, we can't comment on that. Our view always has been we have to compete in a competitive market. We're doing it exactly in the way that Sachin just laid out, investing our products and solutions. That's how we win. And that's what we believe in. We believe in choice back in 2016 when we stepped into real time payments we were clearly the first in the industry to do that in a significant way. So, all of that, I think, is true. And we see all of that being differentiated and helping us win. If I look at how we've moved, make moves here in the market, in the U.S. with citizens, how we make moves in the market in Europe with UniCredit or NatWest. So, that model isn't changing. That's exactly what we're doing. If you look back at my prepared remarks, all that we're doing on strengthening our product solutions and our acquisitions and everything there, I think is going to be the way for us to win. I see there is a tremendous opportunity for us and that it's unrelated to this particular set of headlines that are out there. And we'll see how that plays out. But we will lean in with our customers and be there with them for their needs and push on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hey, I appreciate you squeezing me in here. I just wanted to kind of follow up on the earlier question around the value-added services that you're attaching to kind of transactions around the world and heard the earlier context around some of the breakouts you provided historically. But I wanted, I was wondering if you could kind of talk specifically to the kind of multi-rail strategy and the embrace of new networks and just what the progress has been and where you see the most opportunity to attach your value-added services to other networks, what those conversations look like? And if there are any kind of areas in the VAS portfolio where you think that you could potentially add more capabilities over time to address some of the needs of other networks. Thanks.\nMichael Miebach: Right. It\u2019s interesting when you look at the rise of alternative payment tools, or basically the breadth of the choice that is available to consumers and businesses in terms of payments today. So, you\u2019ve got cards obviously. Then, you have account-to-account payments. You have digital public infrastructure government-sponsored account-to-account, you have P2P systems and so forth. So, the choice is broader than ever before. But if you look at the world outside of cards and you compare it to the world of card payments, wherever cards are available in a competitive-level playing field, a lot of businesses and consumers opt for cards because they give them protections. They give them protections for fraud. They give them protections around digital identity, theft and so forth. And this is coming right back to your question. We see tremendous opportunity here in the cybersecurity space. That is where I think there is the opportunity, the foremost, first and foremost opportunity for our vast portfolio to apply to non-Mastercard transactions. We talked about MasterCard access in the past. So, we have found ways through technology to make the connection into non-Mastercard brand and transactions easier for customers. So, we\u2019re a truly scheme-agnostic provider for a whole range of our services because everybody needs security solutions. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. But data analytics solutions, test and learn, campaign management, what should I have on my shelves, when should I open my branches, these are a set of common questions that customers, particularly in the retail and commerce space, ask us. Again, that\u2019s a set of services that goes way beyond the relationship that we have on the payment side. Again, that is an ability for us to continue to diversify and pull in new customers. So, for us, keeping other payment networks\u2019 transactions safe is an opportunity. We will continue to do that wherever we can and lean in with that.\nDevin Corr: Thank you. Brianna, I think we\u2019re out of time for questions. Is there anything, Michael, you\u2019d like to wrap with?\nMichael Miebach: Well, I just want to thank everybody again for your support. We\u2019re looking to have you all and hopefully everybody else who\u2019s not on the call, to join us for the Investor Community Meeting on November 13. As I said earlier, this has been a bit of a look back onto the quarter, onto this year, into the fourth quarter. And then, we\u2019re going to take a look further out when we get together in a couple of weeks from now. I\u2019m excited about that. As always, everything that we share with you is the fruit of the work of the 34,000 people here at Mastercard. And I will never have a call where I don\u2019t thank them for everything they do, and that goes out to everyone here at Mastercard. Thank you very much, and speak soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning to page three, which shows our financial performance for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 14%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 12%. And operating income was up 15%. Net income and EPS increased 13% and 16% respectively, primarily reflecting the strong operating income growth in the third quarter. EPS was $3.89, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $983 million through October 28th, 2024. Let's turn to page four, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the third quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 8%. Credit and debit growth was aided by the conversions of the previously announced Wells Fargo commercial credit and citizens' debit migrations respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 14%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. Turning to page five, switch transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q3. Both card present and card not present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration, as contactless now represents approximately 70% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to slide six for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the third quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 11% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 19% primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand for our consulting and marketing services, the scaling of our fraud and security, and our identity and authentication solutions, and pricing. Now, let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric, domestic assessments were up 10%, while worldwide GDV also grew 10%. Cross-border assessments increased 22%, while cross-border volumes increased 17%. The five-ppt difference is primarily driven by pricing in international markets and mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 14%, while switched transactions grew 11%. The three-ppt difference is primarily due to mix and pricing. Other network assessments were $227 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation, and other franchisees, and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 12%. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, including planned increased spending in advertising and marketing, as well an increase in indirect access, as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. Turning to page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trends. Our Switch metrics in Q3 and through the first four weeks of October remained generally stable sequentially, both in the U.S. and across the globe as spending remained healthy. Of note, in the U.S., a portion of the uptick in switched volumes in the first four weeks of October was related to certain events, including the mix of high-volume calendar days and the tightening of social security payments this year as compared to last year. Turning now to page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. As Michael said, consumer spending remained healthy, and we delivered across all aspects of our business in Q3. We remain well-positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by our diversified business model, the significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment in both consumer and commercial, and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions. While we continue to monitor the economic headwinds and tailwinds, we remain focused on executing on our strategy. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. Now, turning to Q4 2024, year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low-teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact on this growth rate, while we expect a zero to one PPT headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 operating expense growth to be the high end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this reflects higher spending in advertising and marketing in Q4, as compared to Q3, primarily driven by the cadence of spend related to our sponsorship activities. Acquisitions and FX are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this OpEx growth for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses, in Q4, we expect an expense of approximately $85 million. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue, and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% for Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business. A further comment on tax, there's now more clarity on the potential impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules as more countries continue to enact these rules. As disclosed in our 10-K, we have an incentive grant in Singapore. Starting in 2025, we expect the new Pillar Two global minimum tax rules will offset the benefit of this incentive brand. For reference, Q3 year-to-date 2024, this benefit had the impact of reducing our tax rate by approximately 4%. On a personal note, I'd like to thank all of you for the well-wishes I've received over the last several weeks. I feel good and happy to be here speaking with you today. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Devin. Hey, Sanjay, thanks for the question. Hopefully, can you hear me? Look, I mean the consumer continues to be healthy. We continue to see positive trends from a consumer health standpoint. They're spending in a very healthy manner. So, that's the underlying basis for what you're seeing for our Q3 metrics, as well as what you're seeing in the first four weeks of October. I will caution and say these are first four weeks of October, so they don't make the quarter. But that being said, there's no doubt in my mind that the consumer continues to show strength. But beyond that, like I mentioned, in the first four weeks, we cannot ignore the fact that there were certain one-time items such as the calendarization impact, which I mentioned, and the timing of social security payments which kind of caused that little bump that you see in U.S. metrics take place. But net-net, here's the story, that the reality is, overall, with employment continuing to remain strong with interest rates starting to come down -- well, actually, technically, that there were reductions in the Fed-driven interest rates, but we've seen that the yield curve has actually gone right back up. But the reality is there continues to be confidence from a consumer standpoint. We've seen that come through, and it certainly came through in their spending patterns as well. Right. So, tokenization cutting-edge technology, as I call it, we've been investing it for years. We're in the billions of tractions now. The benefit of tokenization is pretty clear. It helps on the security side. The tokenized transaction has -- always a more secure transaction as the data will be only available for one-time use. That drives adoption across the ecosystem on the basis of higher securities. This has been rapidly around the world. We are in a whole range of markets around the world today. And it doesn't end at security, there's benefit that is coming to merchants from tokenization as there are higher conversion rates, and online commerce, for example. So, disability for us is -- cannot be underestimated. So, we're going to continue to invest in it. There is a set of base functionality around tokenization as security, as I explained. There will be other solutions that we can tag on to that, for example, toke lifecycle management, and so forth. Now, we have been investing for many years in this capability. And, of course, we see this as an opportunity for us to drive our revenue line, and charge for that, but it's very clearly related to and direct upside that our customer see, is our merchant from higher conversion or lower fraud on the securities side. Hey, Rayna. Thanks for your question. So, look, I mean, Europe is clearly a very important region. We continue to perform well in that region. What we're seeing from a macro standpoint, and you've probably seen this in the most recent economic data, is you're starting to see positive trends come through there with momentum in France and Spain, and even in Germany. The reality is, Europe has kind of been a little bit of a tale of two cities. You've had Northern Europe, and then you have Southern Europe. Southern Europe has been actually performing well for the longest time. And now you're starting to see some momentum come through in other parts of Europe as well. So, net-net, I would tell you, the consumer confidence continues to improve, unemployment remains low. And so, from a macro standpoint you're in a good place from a European standpoint. As it relates to Mastercard's business in Europe, a couple of factors, there still remains a tremendous secular opportunity in Europe. We're tapping into that. We continue to actually be performing well on that basis, which is why you're seeing that come through in our drivers. And then, even beyond that, going back to the growth algorithm, which Michael was speaking about earlier, we continue to win share. I mean, the reality is what you're seeing come through in the nature of the drivers is the conversions of the UniCredit portfolio. You're seeing that come through in the nature of the Deutsche Bank portfolio. These are ones we've talked about in the past. You're just starting to see that come through in the metrics now. And also, we continue to be very focused on our efforts for migrating from Maestro to Debit Mastercard. And you're seeing all of that come through in the metrics. So, net-net, very important region; the economy seems to be holding up well, and in some cases showing renewed signs of improvement. And then, our business there, both from a secular and a market share standpoint that this should perform well. I noted such and that you said, even in Germany. I wouldn't miss my chance on that, Michael. Thank you. Look, I mean, the reality is, from a competitive environment standpoint, the market continues to be competitive. We continue to compete in this environment. Nothing, from our perspective, is vastly different from what was there already a year ago or two years ago. The reality is we'll continue to compete here. From an incentive standpoint, you're very well aware that in order to actually win volume, you're going to have to incentivize customers, which is what we do. And then, when you win the volume, you have the ability to generate revenues from the volume in question, optimize those portfolios, grow them at a faster pace, and then deliver services, which helps us increase our net value yield. Really, the playbook is very much the same, and from a competitive environment standpoint, not much is changing on that front. All right. So, maybe I start on that. So, these are very different and complementary businesses. I think that's the first to think about. So, obviously we have a thriving cross-border driven part of our carded business and the P2M space. We make something very complex across border, pretty simple for consumers. That's a good starting point, but there's many other use cases that are not actually happening through PODS today and as part of our one-stop strategy for payments for years, we have been investing in going after those flows and having a differentiated proposition there. So, Mastercard Move, which has domestic and cross-border type of payments, currently what we see here is this is a pretty differentiated reach that we have across 95% of the world's bank population, 180 countries, 150 currencies, that's a very different proposition. There are kind of use cases that you think about, think insurance distribution, gig workers that work remotely and develop an application for another company somewhere else around the world. So, it's a pain point for many companies how to do this effectively and at attractive price and our growth rates tell us that we're having a right proposition out there. In the third quarter, we're seeing over 40% of transaction growth in this business. So, differentiated solution and I come back to the announcement with Citi here. So, Citi is a strong player in cross-border and here this is one plus one is three as we have more endpoints and starting points for a transaction that we can bring into this partnership. Yes. So, sure, Darrin. Thanks for your question. So, let me take the tax rate question first, and I'll come back to your question around what you're seeing in terms of yield trends. So, on the tax rate look, now we see greater clarity as it relates to the implementation of this bill of two global minimum tax. And what we thought, and you've seen this in our 10K disclosures in the past that we've had this incentive agreement with Singapore. The reality is now Singapore has actually enacted those rules. There's one final step which is left to be done in Singapore, but the reality is it's getting pretty close. So, what we wanted to do was help our investors understand the impact of Q3 year-to-date that we had experienced as a result of these incentive plans from Singapore on our tax rate. And that's that four percentage number which I kind of shared with you. I can't tell you exactly what our tax rate is going to look like on a going forward basis, but order of magnitude, right, the impact of not getting the incentive grant in Singapore this year would have had an impact about four points on our tax rate. So, I wanted to get that clarity out for the investor community on that. On the first part of your question, which is around yields, look, we're very pleased with the value we're delivering to our customers, whether it's in cross-border, whether it's in domestic, whether it's through the services we bring. And the reality is what you're seeing come through is, I think you were talking about the spread between the driver metric and the revenue metric here, look, there are a number of factors which go into this, right? So, for example, on the transaction processing side, you can see the impact of mix come through. And this is a mix from both a cross-border and domestic standpoint when you're comparing the driver trend with the revenue trend, but it's also geographical mix, depending on which geographies are going faster and which geographies are going slower. So, you've got to take those factors into consideration. We certainly do when we're running the business. We look, like Michael said, we're not looking to win every portfolio. We want to win the right portfolios in the right regions with the fastest growth opportunity, which have the best yield. Because at the end of the day, what we're trying to optimize is driving that yield up. And that's what you're seeing come through in my comments around the mixed spread, which is there both on cross-border as well as in transaction processing. The other factor I'll point out is in the third quarter, you did get a little bit of a lift come through from FX volatility. Now, that sits in our transaction processing assessments line item. That is very hard to predict. I will tell you right now, FX volatility is running at record low levels over the last few weeks. So, it's a little bit of what we can do to enable the yield, which is what we do by delivering good value, good products, good services, as well as winning the right portfolios. And then, there's a little bit of stuff which happens from a macro standpoint, such as FX yield, et cetera, et cetera, which kind of plays into that. So, hopefully, Darrin, that gives you a little bit of color as to how we're trying to optimize the mix between what we're seeing from a driver trend standpoint and what we're seeing from an overall assessment revenue standpoint. Hey, I'll just quickly jump in and clarify when Michael talked about the 11% growth rate on commercial, he was talking about the currency neutral growth rate for the third quarter of this year. Just want to be sure that we have that. Sure. So, first of all we'll talk about '25 at the right time, but let me give you a little bit of color and things to think about between what you're seeing in 2024 and 2025, right? Obviously, you guys know about the leap year effect. And I know you're asking a few poor questions, but more broadly speaking, you've got the leap year effect taking place in 2024. You're not going to have that in 2025. The things which you've got to keep in mind are, number one, we've had significant share wins, which have started to actually roll on in 2024. So, we talked a little bit about the citizens win. We talked a little bit about the Wells Fargo win. We talked about UniCredit, Deutsche Bank. Now, these will lap and the lapping effect of this will come through four quarters after they typically come on our books. So, for example, take something like the Wells Fargo commercial credit win. That was completely migrated onto Mastercard in the second quarter, second quarter of this year, 2024. So, you'll see the lapping effect of that come through in 2025. Similarly, as it relates to citizens, the vast majority of the ramp up on citizens took place in Q2 of 2024 with a little tail effect in Q3. So, you'll see that again lap off in 2025. So, I want to kind of just make sure that you've got that as a line of sight element. The other element is around pricing, right? I mean we've talked a little bit about some of the pricing actions which we've taken for all the innovation investments that we've been doing as a company. You're going to see the lapping effect of that come through as well. So, these are a couple of things which I would keep in mind as you go in from 2024 to 2025. But we'll talk in more detail about '25 at the right time over the next few months. Thank you. So, you mentioned it, I think, in the July call, you said we're alive now in China. So, we're alive as of May with a whole number of issuers and we're alive in China with a very unique proposition, which is a single use card that can be used domestically as well as cross-border. We've been in China for a long time, but that was a cross-border only use case. Now, this single proposition is a card that gives full global acceptance and it gives increasing domestic acceptance through a combination of measures. One is some of the local QR wallets that you can load your card into so you can benefit from that acceptance. And then, we're busy investing in acceptance across the country. There's interest from the Chinese government to link their economy more closely to the global economy. So, they're keen on building out acceptance so that people who travel into China can use cards as they would normally anywhere else in the world. Now, we're excited about the opportunity for a number of reasons. It's a huge economy, obviously, and we want to participate. So, that is a significant secular opportunity for us as we invest in this market. And this is regardless of up and down of the overall economy in China. This is a share situation. It's a secular opportunity as a starting point. But it will take investment. It will take investment. It will take time. Coming back to the acceptance part, issuing is a little easier to solve, but without acceptance, then that's going to be hard to do. So, we will continue to focus on that. As you know, we have a joint venture there and we have our own set of activities in China through services and so forth, which we continue that we have always done in China. So, exciting opportunity, medium to long term, the fact that we are in China does make us now the most accepted payment solution in the world and that is a differentiating factor for us as we look ahead. Sorry, just want to make sure. Can you hear me, Fahed? Yes. Okay. I'm looking at the end of the day. Yes. Yes. I just want to be sure you can hear me. Look, at the end of the day, I think the way you should think about our philosophy along both our investments as well as how we drive remuneration from those investments is unchanged. We've always been in the business of investing heavily in driving innovation. As we drive innovation, we deliver value to our customers and to our merchants and consumers. And like with every other business, when you make investments, you want to realize the value for that. And that's what we talk about in the nature of pricing. And that's what we do. So, nothing's changed philosophically. I would tell you in terms of how we're running the business there, you can see that year-over-year, we look to make investments from an OpEx standpoint for all the investments we're doing in our people to drive our strategic initiatives that comes up with value propositions, which allows us to price for them. And that's really the way we're executing on our business. I would tell you that if you think about our business, broadly speaking, you should think about it as no different than in the past, right? On the one hand, we're operating in a very competitive market where you're seeing us compete for winning important portfolios. When you do that, you pay rebates and incentives. So, we like to think about pricing in the context of net pricing, which is net of the compression we take on rebates and incentives. And we continue to still see that environment as one where we have minimal net pricing, which is the combination of what we do in the nature of investments and the reiteration we derive for it, net of what we have to do in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. So, it's a combination of both of those factors which we're balancing."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning everyone. On Halloween, well, nothing spooky here. The headline this quarter, again, we delivered strong results across all aspects of our business. We're adding to that momentum with the announcement of two planned acquisitions, Recorded Future and Minna Technologies. In the third quarter, net revenues were up 14%, and adjusted net income increased 13% versus a year-ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were underpinned by healthy consumer spending, including strong cross-border volume growth of 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis. And value-added services and solutions net revenue grew 19% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. The macroeconomic environment remained supportive, and continues to underpin the strength in consumer spending. The labor market remained strong, even if slightly below historically tight levels. And inflation has moderated, albeit at varied levels across categories and countries. Overall, we remain positive about our growth outlook, but we will continue to monitor the environment. We will continue to focus on the things we can control, and execute on our growth algorithm. By tapping into the sizable secular shift opportunity to electronic payments, and that across both spend and transactions. Also, by further penetrating the addressable market in commercial and new payment flows, by gaining market share, and by growing value-added services and solutions. Let's take a look at our progress in these four areas, starting with the shift to digital. There's still a long runway for the secular shift for person to merchant payments. Our diverse global footprint and innovative digital-first proposition enable us to maximize this opportunity. A key driver is acceptance, which we have effectively doubled over the last five years. We are increasing acceptance by digitizing untapped pools of spend in areas, like transit, to open up new transaction flows. Over the years, we have helped hundreds of transit systems around the world move to open loop. And now, our contact-less technology is making it easier for international travelers in Beijing and people in Hong Kong can now seamlessly pay for their train trips. The shift to digital means turning every device into an acceptance device. Just think about that. Tap-on-phone is now live in over 110 markets. Since the beginning of this year, the number of tap-on-phone locations almost doubled. And more than 10% are net new acceptance locations for Mastercard. You see it everywhere, at food trucks in major cities, at the farmers' market in my town, in the air to make in-flight purchases, and at sporting events like the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. We're adding more access through acceptance efforts. In Africa, we're partnering to make our QR pay-by-link technology available to every merchant with a KaiOS-powered phone, that's putting affordable ways to be paid in the hands of underserved small businesses across the whole continent. We're investing in cutting-edge technologies, like tokenization and pass keys to make the online shopping experience better and more secure. And that's the expectation people have when they see our brand. They know it's convenient, fast, and frictionless. And that ease and simplicity are not sacrificed for world-class security and protection against fraud. They get all that from Mastercard in every transaction. Efforts like these are being developed by our teams across the globe, including at our newly expanded tech hub, in Pune, India, where I was earlier this month. India is where we first launched the Mastercard payment pass key service, which replaces the need for passwords or texts for one-time pass codes with biometrics; simple and seamless ways to address the high levels of fraud and the need for secure payments everywhere, no matter the channel. We're extending and scaling that into new markets with partners like noon Payments, one of the largest PSPs in Middle East Africa. We're also collaborating with India's leading wearables brand, Bolt. We will work with them to enable quick, highly secured tokenized contact-less payments on their devices. The continued adoption of these capabilities positions us well to capture the large secular opportunity in consumer payments. Now, the consumer is one part of the story. There's a sizable opportunity in unlocking new flows across commercial payments and disbursement and remittances. We're seeing strong momentum in these spaces. In commercial, we have the right solutions, and we're expanding into new verticals with specialized partners who offer significant reach. Last quarter, we announced the partnership with CBC to provide car distribution, acceptance and financial education to almost two million retailers. We're now building on this momentum with a partnership with payment orchestrator, Yallo. They work with some of the largest consumer packaged goods distributors in Latin America, including Nestle\u0301, Mondelez, and Coca-Cola. This partnership will enable three million small and medium-sized customers to use Mastercard small business cards to make purchases. And in the healthcare industry, we're partnering with Fundbot, a fintech specializing in supply chain financing. We will work with them to capture additional B2B flows with virtual cards and address insurance payment delays that have historically posed challenged. Now shifting to disbursements and remittances, we're also scaling with important players in that space. You saw our announcement at Mastercard Move, we'll be integrated into Citi's cross-border payments network. Citi customers in 65 countries can now make secure near real-time cross-border payment transfers to Mastercard debt cards in 14 receiving markets worldwide with more to come early next year. In the U.S., we have expanded our partnership with payment platform processor Astra Inc. to accelerate the adoption of Mastercard Move for push-to-card payments. In Latin America, we announced partnerships with Paysend, Leap Financial, and Felix Pago to tackle the significant U.S. and Latin America cross-border corridor opportunity. Another important element of our growth algorithm is gaining more share of the carded market. And we are, even in today's competitive marketplace, we do this by understanding our customers' needs and by offering differentiated service that can help them and drive value and/or choice to the end customer. For example, this quarter, in Belgium, Brussels Airlines announced that they will migrate their co-brand card and loyalty program to Mastercard. We extended our agreement with the second largest bank in Europe, BNP Paribas Group. The extension includes additional services such as launch pads to co-create new digital experiences through our dedicated innovation hub. We're building on our partnership with one of the largest commercial banks in Qatar; Doha Bank. In addition to renewing debit and prepaid, they will migrate the majority of their credit program to Mastercard. They were also the first bank in Qatar to launch our cross-border payment services. We're teaming up with Alibaba.com to enable their first co-branded U.S. small business credit card. And we signed an exclusive partnership with Mobitel's mobile wallet: e-Mola, in Mozambique. To me, all these reinforce Mastercard is a valued partner to our customers. Last quarter, I highlighted the progress we're making against the significant opportunity in Africa. Today, let's focus on Latin America, a diverse region that embraces new technologies and represents a large untapped opportunity to convert cash and check to electronic forms of payment. External sources estimate that more than 60% of purchase transactions in Latin America are still paid in cash and check. We have been striving strong growth in the region with third quarter year-to-day GDV up 19% year-over-year on a local currency basis. And we are working locally to win share. We're growing with two of the largest banks in Guatemala. Banco G&T Continental will migrate the majority of their debit portfolio to Mastercard. And Banco Industrial will drive new MasterCard credit and debit issuance, and use us as the network provider for their neobank. In El Salvador, Banco Agricola has agreed to migrate their debit portfolio to Mastercard and drive new credit issuance. The leading credit issuer in Uruguay, OSEA, has renewed our agreement and will convert a private label portfolio to Mastercard. We also have excellent merchant partnerships in Latin America. In Chile, we're securing our position as the market leader with retail issuing partners. We extended our card issuing partnership with the second largest merchant in Chile, Cencosud. We renewed our exclusive card issuing partnership with Banco Ripley, the financial institution of Ripley Corp, one of the largest retail conglomerates in Chile and Peru. This snapshot of Latin America shows more examples of how we continue to win and retain customer agreements around the globe. Now, turning to value-add services and solutions. Our strong growth here is supported by strong differentiated products, transaction flows, and customer demands. And we aren't stopping here. We are investing in new products to further expand our addressable market and address the needs of our customers. Let's start with cybersecurity. We play a critical role advancing trust in securing a global digital ecosystem before, during, and after a transaction. Our agreement to acquire Recorded Future is expected to add threat intelligence capabilities to our leading identity solutions, real-time fraud scoring, and cybersecurity services. The company provides real-time visibility into potential threats through differentiated AI-powered solutions. This enables customers to act on and mitigate risks before they occur. We can enhance these solutions with the addition of Mastercard Insights product. This planned addition is expected to make our cybersecurity value proposition stronger, open up cross-sell opportunities with new customers, and add to our addressable market. Another trend is the growth of the subscription economy. Subscriptions are everywhere; delivery, entertainment, shopping, software, healthcare, and much more. They play a big role in people's lives and are supported by and help grow digital payments. With that, comes an increasing demand for more transparency and control from consumers as well as regulators. That's why we have agreed to acquire Minna Technologies. Their payment scheme agnostic services go beyond insights. It enables consumers, like those today with Capital One, to easily modify, extend, or cancel subscriptions directly within their banking applications and websites. And merchants benefit from the ability to re-engage their customers. The technology will also add to our broader set of tools like consumer clarity to enhance the overall value we deliver, including helping merchants build long-term deeper relationships with consumers through loyalty, rewards, and personalized offers. At the end of the day, it's about creating a win-win approach for all involved; merchants, banks, and consumers. The expectation from consumers for personalized experiences also continues to grow. To meet this demand, we acquired best-in-class personalization assets in 2022 by Dynamic Yield. Since then, we have enriched the consumer-consented personalization experience with insights from our data analytics. That's why we've had a lot of success scaling with around 500 retail and commerce partners, including luxury hospitality conglomerate in the Middle East, Kerzner. And now, we have introduced a new solution for issuing banks called Personalization Breeze. It combines our market-leading personalization offering with our propensity modeling to send individualized messages to cardholders. This is a fantastic example of the value we can deliver when we combine the proposition of our acquisitions, data, and other service offerings. Now, one of those offerings is open banking. It's no surprise. People want greater choice, control, and access to financial services. And banks want faster and more efficient processes. Our open banking technology can deliver all that. We recently announced enhancements to our open banking lending program. Through our partnership with Argyle, lenders can now verify income and employment through consumer-permission payroll data. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have authorized this as a data source. And we work with them to provide asset verification, rent history, and cash flow assessment data during the mortgage underwriting process. This means a streamlined and informed lending process, especially for those with low, thin, or no credit files. We continue to add to, enhance our value-added services and solutions. We provide differentiated value at scale across a diverse set of payment-adjacent areas; cybersecurity, fraud, marketing, personalization, and insights to name a few. All with large addressable markets where we have the right to play, win, and scale, and all that while driving the positive flywheel effect where payments and services reinforce each other. Today's call is a look at the past quarter. We have accomplished how we continue to set ourselves up for the future. We deliver it again across all facets of the business. And there's so much opportunity ahead. We look forward to diving into this and more at our investment community meeting on November 13. Now, Sachin, over to you. Right. So, when I look at our value-added service portfolios, our security solutions is a very significant share of that. Why is that? Because the world is digitizing more, there's an increasing need to secure those transactions. That's a tremendous underlying secular trend for us to be involved with. It's a huge addressable market. So, we build out a set of transaction related solutions over the years before the transaction, after the transaction. One of the more recent ones that we talked about that we invested heavily in using our Brighterion acquisition from back in 2017 to use our AI capabilities is decision intelligence. We've now boosted the product with Gen AI and the outcome that we see is tremendous. This is up to a 20% lift that we see. Now, these are solutions that our customers opt into because they like those solutions and they like the lift that they get out of that. As I was saying earlier in the prepared remarks is we're not stopping here. Clearly, cybersecurity risk doesn't stop at the transaction. It goes beyond the transaction. It goes into reacting to cybersecurity risk that you see in your business that goes beyond fraud, aware of those vulnerabilities. You recall our RiskRecon acquisition from a few years ago. Again, those are services that our customers buy from us because they feel they are under threat and they want to step up their defenses. Now, recorded future, this is a subscription-based service into threat intelligence, which is the next logical step to go even further and look even further ahead and see what threat is coming my way. So, we have a natural position in here. It starts with the transaction, but we're selling these services way beyond the transaction. We've been historically on the record to say about 50% of our services are somehow related to transactions, but the other 50% are not and we're building out that portfolio with recorded future being one example. We're very excited about that. Threat intelligence, if you look at the customer set of recorded future, it's very impressive and we're looking forward to bringing those into the fold as and when the approval process ends. And you see us winning. If you look at some of the movements here in the United States recently on the debit side, there is, on the basis of our differentiated propositions, we keep winning, so that resonates. We keep investing in that, as I just spoke about, but it's also pretty clear in that competitive environment where we hope to have the better solution for our customers in the end consumer. There is not every deal is for us and we don't want to win every deal. There is competitive movement in different parts of the world and we are very thoughtful about that. There is financial discipline. In the end, what we keep in mind is the net revenue yield. And then, on your question around the accounting, you have it right, I mean, the stuff which is on card rails, for example, domestic send, related revenues, send and payment network, and then the cross-border volumes, which flow on non-card rails are sitting in our value-added services and solutions. Thank you. Great question. One of my favorite topics to talk about commercial, earlier, I spoke about the tremendous secular opportunity we see in consumer, and then build on that and said, what is an even bigger opportunity in commercial? So we like it for those reasons. As I commented on previous calls, there were various structural issues over the years why this hasn't really unlocked in emerging markets, there were issues that we're not familiar with the risk. There wasn't technology that was available in back offices of smaller companies and so on and so on. If you pass forward to today, we're seeing a situation where this the momentum feels solid. We're seeing 11% growth in commercial. And that's good. And that's above consumer. And that's we like that. So, when I look ahead and say, what should we expect going forward? I'm not going to give you an outlook right now. Maybe you should dial into the Investor Day in a little while. But the point here is, we see our ability to put out solutions with different partners more globally into the back office systems of companies, our partnership with Oracle and SAP, for example, we see a whole new generation of treasurers that are digitally minded and businesses that are having an expectation that their digital lives in the office should be not worse than their digital lives and their personal lives. So, when we put out our mobile based T&E card proposition, then people are saying that it's cool. We like that. So, there is definitely changes happening. The most significant change that I see is really the interest of our issuing partners around the world to start to see this is a proposition to go into. I can talk to my customer about the working capital effect of a virtual card as part of their payment. That's 30 days of working capital. That is a real winning argument that everybody can understand, including our issuers getting very excited about. So, we see this as a space that's going to continue and drive growth for us. And you saw our reorganization where we align behind commercial and new payment flows because we believe it's going to be a tremendous growth driver. Sachin, thank you for clarifying. Right. So, value-added services and solutions, it's been a true differentiator for Mastercard for the last seven years at least. And we anchored around two fundamental points. I talked about one earlier, which is in a digitizing world, keeping that digital ecosystem in a company or in a consumer context or a bank context safe. So, our security solutions have been a differentiator and I think it's a truly differentiated proposition. The second big underlying trend here is with a highly and a rapidly digitizing world, more and more data becomes available and a lot of more businesses want to make sense of that data. So, this is another powerful trend. So, the second leg of this tool was we're building out a set of data insights solutions. So, that is the general proposition. Now, if you look under the hood of that, to your point there isn't much of a hood under look under the hood that you have. Well, I think we actually did share quite a bit of that over the years. So, on the security side, it's before the transaction, during the transaction, after the transaction, that's our digital identity solutions before. Those are per click solutions where we provide data to give an identity score to somebody that wants to find out, is this the real customer? And then, all the way to our fraud scoring solutions directly linked to the payments, all of that. So, that is pretty known. And on the data insight solution here again, it is a whole set of solutions that help customers that could be a merchant, that could be a bank to engage their customers, their end consumers in a better way through campaign management solutions, test and learn through marketing services, through loyalty and so forth. They are all very different business models, some of them subscription based, some of them per transaction clicks in a very different way. So, all of it, it's a whole mix. The point of all of this is two powerful underlying trends. And within each of these solutions, you have an arc where all of these solutions build on top of each other. They are finely and clearly curated for us to provide an end-to-end solution. So, I can say to our customer, I don't have this widget and that widget for you. I have a solution that can allow you to run your business better. Our engagement is always to help our customers drive their top line. And that's what we do. This is a different proposition than maybe others have out there. We like that because that makes us a strategic partner for our customers, for our customers. Overall, we believe this is differentiated. You've seen strong growth for us for years. You've seen another set of strong numbers for this quarter. And it's been boosting the revenue of the company and our yield. Right. Ramsey, thanks for the question. So, obviously, we all read the headlines, we saw that allegations have been made. Obviously, we can't comment on that. Our view always has been we have to compete in a competitive market. We're doing it exactly in the way that Sachin just laid out, investing our products and solutions. That's how we win. And that's what we believe in. We believe in choice back in 2016 when we stepped into real time payments we were clearly the first in the industry to do that in a significant way. So, all of that, I think, is true. And we see all of that being differentiated and helping us win. If I look at how we've moved, make moves here in the market, in the U.S. with citizens, how we make moves in the market in Europe with UniCredit or NatWest. So, that model isn't changing. That's exactly what we're doing. If you look back at my prepared remarks, all that we're doing on strengthening our product solutions and our acquisitions and everything there, I think is going to be the way for us to win. I see there is a tremendous opportunity for us and that it's unrelated to this particular set of headlines that are out there. And we'll see how that plays out. But we will lean in with our customers and be there with them for their needs and push on. Right. It's interesting when you look at the rise of alternative payment tools, or basically the breadth of the choice that is available to consumers and businesses in terms of payments today. So, you've got cards obviously. Then, you have account-to-account payments. You have digital public infrastructure government-sponsored account-to-account, you have P2P systems and so forth. So, the choice is broader than ever before. But if you look at the world outside of cards and you compare it to the world of card payments, wherever cards are available in a competitive-level playing field, a lot of businesses and consumers opt for cards because they give them protections. They give them protections for fraud. They give them protections around digital identity, theft and so forth. And this is coming right back to your question. We see tremendous opportunity here in the cybersecurity space. That is where I think there is the opportunity, the foremost, first and foremost opportunity for our vast portfolio to apply to non-Mastercard transactions. We talked about MasterCard access in the past. So, we have found ways through technology to make the connection into non-Mastercard brand and transactions easier for customers. So, we're a truly scheme-agnostic provider for a whole range of our services because everybody needs security solutions. So, that's how we think about it. But data analytics solutions, test and learn, campaign management, what should I have on my shelves, when should I open my branches, these are a set of common questions that customers, particularly in the retail and commerce space, ask us. Again, that's a set of services that goes way beyond the relationship that we have on the payment side. Again, that is an ability for us to continue to diversify and pull in new customers. So, for us, keeping other payment networks' transactions safe is an opportunity. We will continue to do that wherever we can and lean in with that. Well, I just want to thank everybody again for your support. We're looking to have you all and hopefully everybody else who's not on the call, to join us for the Investor Community Meeting on November 13. As I said earlier, this has been a bit of a look back onto the quarter, onto this year, into the fourth quarter. And then, we're going to take a look further out when we get together in a couple of weeks from now. I'm excited about that. As always, everything that we share with you is the fruit of the work of the 34,000 people here at Mastercard. And I will never have a call where I don't thank them for everything they do, and that goes out to everyone here at Mastercard. Thank you very much, and speak soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Incorporated Q2, 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then, that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.\nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning everyone. The headline this quarter we delivered very strong results powered by broad based momentum across all aspects of our business. Second quarter net revenues were up 13% and adjusted net income up 24% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP, currency neutral basis. These results were underpinned by healthy consumer spending, including strong cross border volume growth of 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis and value added services and solutions. Net revenue grew 19% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. The macroeconomic environment remains mixed and we continue to monitor the positives and negatives. A few to note, strength in consumer spending continues to be supported by a solid labor market and wage growth. While there are some signs of labor market growth moderating, this is off very strong levels of job creation, as in also, inflation and interest rates remain in focus. We've seen inflation cool, but to varying degrees across carded and non-carded categories. Price levels are still elevated for many goods and services. Interest rates also remain elevated, but many central banks have started to ease and economic indicators support broader rate reductions. While tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain on balance, we remain positive about our growth outlook, but that as a backdrop, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm across core payments, new payment flows and services. You may remember that we recently announced organizational changes to further increase our focus on these priorities. They included the realignment of both regional operations and payments and services to support our growth algorithm. These changes were designed to accelerate growth and unlock capacity to invest in long-term business opportunities. This also helps us continue to deliver positive operating leverage over the long-term. For example, we plan to redeploy resources into growth markets with high cash levels. We will invest in opening acceptance in new verticals, and we will continue to apply technology to help us realize even more of the shift to digital across both consumer and commercial. We will also enhance and expand our value added services, such as in data analytics, fraud and cybersecurity, particularly as we further embed AI into our products and services. As a result of this organizational realignment, which positions us well for the long-term growth, we expect to incur a onetime restructuring charge in the third quarter. Now, moving on to an update on some specific elements of our growth algorithm. In payments, we're driving growth by winning and retaining deals, and we're tapping into the vast secular shift opportunity by expanding in new geographies and further digitizing the payments ecosystem. Let's start with our continued deal momentum. I'm happy to announce that Varo Bank will convert their debit and credit portfolios to Mastercard. They were the first all digital bank to receive a national charter in the United States. Varo chose Mastercard due to our differentiated data insights, merchant funded offers platform and our ability to seamlessly integrate into their technology stack. We extended our enterprise agreement with Wells Fargo and partnered to launch the Attune World Elite Mastercard. This is our first proprietary consumer credit program with the bank. We also want to renew deals this quarter with key US prepaid partners, including our H&R Block, Blackhawk network, relevate and dash solutions. In aggregate, these partnerships will drive meaningful increase in our US prepaid market share. In Canada, we extended our longstanding partnership with the National Bank of Canada across consumer credit, commercial and prepaid for the next decade. And PostaPay, who already issues millions of Mastercard cards in Italy, has expanded our collaboration to drive additional growth across debit and prepaid. Let's deep dive into a few specific verticals and geographies. Travel is, of course a key focus. It has strong growth potential and a meaningful cross border component. Travel is also a natural fit with our virtual car technology and our marketing loyalty and consulting capabilities. We executed several new travel partnerships this quarter. We signed a deal with global digital payments provider checkout.com to enable them to deploy their virtual card issuing solution to their online travel agency customers. We also announced a multi-year agreement with Wells Fargo and Expedia to launch two new co-brand cards with a range of unique travel benefits. And we executed a new co-brand deal with Dashen and Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline in Africa.This builds on a co-brand deal with RwandAir and INM Rwanda that we initiated earlier this year. I'm sure it wasn't lost on you that these two last deals I mentioned are in Africa. The continent is a great example of the vast secular opportunity in emerging markets. External sources estimate that approximately 90% of transactions in Africa are made in cash. We are committed to the digital transformation of the regions and we're doing so by ranking up our investments, developing new partnerships and rapidly expanding our acceptance footprint. For example, Africa is the world's largest adopter of mobile money accounts. Our partnerships with large Telco's and mobile network operators like Airtel, MTN, Vodafone Egypt and others put us in a great position to accelerate inclusion and cash conversion. On the acceptance front, we've more than tripled the number of acceptance locations in Africa over the last five years. We recently signed deals with the Commercial bank of Ethiopia, the largest bank in the country, and I&M Bank in Kenya. These partnerships will enable us to increase share in both markets. In Nigeria and Ghana In Nigeria and Ghana, we partner with BlueSoft Financial, who will work with fintechs across the region to issue Mastercard cards. Also, our Mastercard move capabilities are the foundation for a new cross-border money movement solution with Access Bank Group. Together, we're enabling businesses and consumers in several African markets to send and receive international payments across over 140 countries. Now this secular opportunity is not limited to Africa, we see opportunities around the globe. Think about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Fully capitalizing on that secular trend requires that we continue to innovate to support the digital economy at scale, and we're doing just that. We're enhancing the checkout experience and expanding our tap-on-phone acceptance capabilities. We're scaling our contactless technology in areas like transit, and we are driving the ongoing conversion of Maestro to Debit Mastercard. Let's dig into one, online shopping. It must be simple and it must work on all devices and all channels. That's why we are leaning into a new area of one-click payments. We announced that we will phase out manual card entry for e-commerce payments in Europe by 2030 in favor of a one-click checkout button. There are three foundational components to this effort, all anchored on driving simplicity and security. First, tokenization. Tokenization replaces payment credentials with a digitally secure token. When deployed, fraud rates decrease and approval rates improve. So launching a decade ago, the technology has been broadly adopted around the world. In fact, we surpassed $22 billion tokenized transactions in the first half of 2024, up 49% versus a year ago. Second is Click to Pay. Click to Pay simplifies online guest checkout by eliminating the need to manually enter payment credentials. Guest checkout becomes as easy as remembering your e-mail address. It also makes checkout more secure using the token technology I just mentioned. We are working with our merchants and bank partners to drive adoption. Click to Pay transactions more than doubled year-over-year in the first half of 2024. And third, up payment passes. Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords or text for onetime pass cold. They allow consumers to authenticate online, purchases using a fingerprint or facial features that you use every day when opening your phone. When combined, these powerful technologies are enabling us to deliver on our promise of a simple and secure one-click online checkout experience for consumers. We also continue to enhance in-store checkout. For example, we are scaling our biometric checkout program to new regions. In Europe, we're partnering with Polish Fintech payee to allow shoppers to pay with a simple glance. And in Latin America, we are working with Ingenico, so that consumers that participate in supermarkets can pay with a wave. We're also working at pace to migrate Maestro cards to Debit Mastercard outside the United States. Shifting to Debit Mastercard is a critical element of our strategy as we see a 2x spend lift on cards once they are migrated. This is primarily due to the ability to capture both cross-border and online spend on debit Mastercard. The first half of 2024, we converted over 14 million cards, which brings us to almost 300 million cards migrated since 2016. These innovations are examples of the investments we are making to differentiate the MasterCard experience versus other payment methods like P2P or local payment schemes. We also continue to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new payment flows. Today, I will focus on commercial, starting with accounts payable payments. We are operating from a position of strength. Our market-leading virtual card capabilities have been deployed with over 90 issuers worldwide. Additionally, we are integrating our technology into four of the top five leading global procure-to-pay solution providers, completed the integration of our virtual card technology into Oracle Cloud ERP and commenced invoice payments for the first HSBC corporate customer in US. On the supplier side, we signed several acquirers onto Mastercard receivables managers. This includes Elavon, whose customers are using our AI-powered platform to streamline the process of accepting virtual cards. We also continue to expand distribution of our virtual cards, signing new deals with Brex and ad groups world first. On commercial point of sale, we're increasing the distribution of our commercial card products worldwide. In the US, the Wells Fargo small business credit card portfolio migration is now complete. In Europe, we've extended our partnership with Virgin Money to continue growing our small business portfolio, and our partnership with SAP Concur, which automatically integrates our corporate card data into Concur expense is yielding results. Large insurer Score awarded their T&E card program to Mastercard based on the value delivered through this joint offering. And finally, we're executing against our strategy to penetrate new B2B verticals. This quarter, we signed an exclusive partnership with Latin America, with CBC, the largest Pepsi distributor in the region, and the fintech enabler YalloTech Migo payments. This partnership will provide car distribution acceptance and financial education to almost two million retailers. These small businesses can now use their Mastercard small business cards to purchase inventory and other items. In the health care space, we signed an exclusive partnership with the Medical Tourism Association. They will now accept cards from consumers and utilize virtual cards to make cross-border payments to medical providers. Separately, we are working with Square to broaden card acceptance amongst smaller health care providers in the U.K. Now turning to services, payments support our services and vice versa. Services played an important part in winning many of the deals I just mentioned. And the strong payments drivers helped fuel services growth. That, coupled with strong demand drove 19% value-add services and solutions net revenue growth in the second quarter on a year-over-year currency neutral basis, this is our powerful flywheel turning. I'm excited about our momentum and the future potential whether it's deepening penetration of existing customers, launching new capabilities or distributing our services in new ways and across new customer and transaction types. A few examples. First, our services help to improve MasterCard issuer portfolio performance, thereby supporting our customers' core business objectives. For example, SEB in the Baltics is building their customer loyalty strategy together with Mastercard and Revolut is working with us to develop and execute their marketing strategy, launching campaigns across the U.K., Ireland and Italy. We're also deploying our services across non-FIs, helping to diversify our business and capture a new set of growth opportunities. Customers as varied as Paramount and McDonald's in Taiwan are using our test and learn capabilities to address core business needs, including media measurement and new product introductions. And we're working with LATAM Airlines in Brazil to optimize their co-brand portfolio and develop innovative marketing campaigns. We're partnering to distribute our capabilities in new and more efficient ways, Salesforce has integrated our dispute resolution services into its financial services cloud. This enables banks and other financial institutions to handle disputes and prevent chargebacks more effectively. And KPMG Norway has partnered with the Norwegian government to distribute our risk recount capabilities. The solution will help hundreds of local governments evaluate their cyber risk posture and that of their suppliers. Turning to open banking, we continue to make strong progress in scaling new use cases. I'll use our account opening and account linking use case as an example. Klarna in the US is now using Mastercard's open banking for this purpose. PayPal will leverage account linking, balance check and transaction history for their wallet in the US and Jack Henry will distribute these capabilities to streamline the account opening process for hundreds of issuers they support. So with that, I'll wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We're driving growth by winning and retaining deals, we're penetrating the substantial secular opportunity, and we continue to see strong demand for our services. Now our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead of us. Sachin, over to you.\nSachin Mehra: Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 13%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 10%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 15%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 24% and 27%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a lower tax rate in the current quarter compared to Q2, 2023, primarily due to a sizable discrete tax expense in the prior year as well as the change in the geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $3.59, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $820 million through July 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the second quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, increased by 9% year-over-year. In the US, GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 7%. Debit growth was aided by the conversion of a previously announced debit win in the US Outside of the US, volume increased 11% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 11%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q2, both card present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 69% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards are issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the second quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 9%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives, which were lower than anticipated, primarily due to the timing of planned deal activity. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 19%, primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers Strong demand for our consulting, data analytics and marketing services and the scaling of our fraud and security and our identity and authentication solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%, primarily due to mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 17%, the four ppt difference is primarily driven by mix and pricing. Transaction processing assessments were up 13%, while switch transactions grew 11%. The two ppt difference is primarily due to mix and pricing. Other network assessments were $244 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend within the year. Turning to Page 9. Let me comment on the operating metric trends in the second quarter and then through the first four weeks of July. As a reminder, our Q1 switch metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over one ppt to growth across each of switched volumes, switch transactions and cross-border volumes. In addition, our switch metrics in Q1 and April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After adjusting for the leap year, the timing of Easter and excluding the benefit from the US debit portfolio when I previously discussed, our switch metrics in Q2 were generally stable sequentially in the US and across the globe. Looking at the first four weeks of July, trends remained generally stable versus Q2. Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. As Michael said, there are a number of economic headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we remain focused on executing on our strategy. Business fundamentals remain strong as evidenced by the results we delivered this quarter across all aspects of our business. Our diversified business model underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the continued secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions continues to position us well for the opportunities ahead. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. Now turning to Q3, 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate while we expect a one to two ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expense growth to be at the low double-digit range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We expect higher growth in advertising and marketing in Q3 compared to the first half of the year primarily driven by the cadence of spend related to our sponsorship activities. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this OpEx growth for the quarter, while we expect a 0 to one ppt tailwind from foreign exchange. Separately, as Michael mentioned, as part of our recent reorganization, we expect to record a onetime restructuring charge in Q3 of approximately $190 million. This will be recorded as a special item and excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. We expect these actions will free up capacity to further invest in our strategic priorities as we continue to execute on our growth algorithm. We also expect they will contribute to delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. As it relates to the full year we expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year, and foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately one ppt for the year. In terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth for the year. Other items to keep in mind. On other income and expenses, in Q3, we expect an expense of approximately $100 million. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 17% and 18% for Q3 and 17% to 17.5% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. One last point. I wanted to let you know that we are planning to host an Investor Day in New York on November 13. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.\nDevin Corr: Thank you, Sachin. Julianne, please open the call for questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good morning. Michael, can you talk about US merchant litigation, the settlement rejection and the ball forward from here? How should we think about the range of outcomes?\nMichael Miebach: Right. Thanks, Harshita. You're not asking about the secular opportunity. I know the same. So the merchant settlement. So the first thing I would say is we're disappointed where this has landed for now. And I would describe it as we respectfully disagree with the court's ruling to reject the settlement. This has been negotiated over many years across many parties. I think with best intentions, and they would have produced a lot of benefits for consumers, for merchants and across all parties. So this is now not happening. We are obviously ready and we will take all efforts to ensure that a solution is found before it goes to trial, engage our parties. We've done this in previous scenarios before. It's difficult to speculate our outcomes at this point. But I think this intention to lean in and see how we can provide more security predictability to merchants and to banks and our parties here is what's driving us. So there's a number of co-defendants in this, and everybody will obviously take their own decisions here. But across the board, obviously, there has to be a dialogue and we find the best outcome of this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTrevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask on rebates and incentives growth. I think that came in a little bit better than you guys have been expecting for 2Q. Sachin, if you could just unpack some of the upside there relative to expectations and then any help for what you're expecting for R&I growth over the next couple of quarters.\nSachin Mehra: Sure. Thanks, Trevor. So you're right. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our rebates and incentives did come in slightly lower than our expectations for the second quarter. I just want to kind of take it up a level, just to kind of remind everybody, we're very active in the markets. We are constantly looking at what opportunities exist with existing customers and then with who could be potential new customers. And we have a view on what our pipeline of activities is. So the vast majority of what we had in the nature of better or, I would say, lower rebates and incentives in the second quarter were driven by some of those -- that deal activity not materializing in the second quarter. It still remains in the pipeline. It's still something we expect will occur as the year progresses. And then more specifically, as it relates to Q3, we expect that our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments will be higher than it was in Q2. And it's essentially based on exactly what I just said, which is it's a very rich deal pipeline that we have. And again, this is more of a timing issue than anything else.\nMichael Miebach: It comes back to the point. In the end, we want to be in the transactional floor. We want to be relevant to our customers. We want to be relevant in the eyes of the consumers that they have a Mastercard product in their hand, and we fight for the deals that we find strategically relevant that also meet our financial criteria. In the end, it all has to add up in combination between payments and services that our net revenue yield develops positively and that we keep in focus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaniel Perlin: Thanks. Good morning. Can we just spend a second on the realignment of the organization a little bit? I know you talk about it to create capacity and drive incremental growth. I think the question I have is how should we think about that in driving kind of new constituencies as you talk about new verticals and maybe expansion of data analytics. And then more specifically, how does that open up the aperture of the network as we think about that going forward?\nMichael Miebach: Right, Dan. So as I said earlier, the idea here is to accelerate growth. The idea is not to reposition our strategy. We've articulated our strategy. You'll hear more of that in the investor community meeting in November and how we see that play out in more detail across our core payment solutions, new flows and the services portfolio. I purposefully stated the point on markets with high cash penetration. So here is as I laid out in the context of Africa, but there's more in other emerging markets around the world, there's a tremendous opportunity here. So we want to strengthen our front line. It's also clear that the recipe to participate in the secular opportunity emerging markets isn't the same as in developed markets. So we're investing in product and so forth. It's pretty clear that on the services side, as far as the areas of focus are concerned. We continue to be guided by underlying strong secular trends, and one of that is for really any of our corporate partners and B2B partners that they want to make sense of their enterprise data and make better decisions. And how do we do that? We do that by leveraging our artificial intelligence solutions set of assistance, a set of fine-tuning how they could have more personalized suggestions to their end consumers, et cetera, et cetera. That's one part, help our customers make better decisions, not changing, but very specific solutions with a higher weightage to AI. And then on the security side and the cybersecurity side, all of this data has to be kept safe. We kept saying that for years. That's a strong secular trend in itself, and making sure that we fine-tune our solutions here. We've got to move faster because the bad guys are also moving faster, and they have the similar technology tools at their hand now. So leveraging artificial intelligence, an example I gave last quarter around Decision Intelligence Pro, that's predicting what is the next card that might be frauded. Before it actually happens, those kind of solutions provide significant lift to our customers in terms of preventing fraud obviously giving peace of mind to their consumers and overall helping our business, and it's a close link to our payments underlying payments business. So all of that -- it's largely the same strategy, but we're really focusing on very specific aspects of that, and there are other aspects of our portfolio that we're going to dial down as a result of this effort.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning, Michael and Sachin. Europe continues to be your largest geo by GDV and also highly differentiated growth there continues. Would appreciate your look forward on cash digitization opportunity, thoughts on the consumer. And then the outlook also for cross-border travel in and out of Europe.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So let me start. I want to anchor on what you -- how you framed your question. It's been a strong growth story for us in Europe. That's Continental Europe as well as the U.K. We've seen tremendous share growth there. And that's really focusing down and investing more locally in Europe, have a better presence there, engage with national governments as well as with European institutions, which we feel very European and Europe. That's the first thing I would say. When I come back to the times of COVID, it was -- there was a large set of economies in Europe that were lagging, I would argue on the digitization front, changing behaviors to consumers have increased the pressure to digitize further, and it has happened. So we've seen Europe catch up and obviously shows in our numbers. But back to the point of secular opportunity we just discussed. If you look at the economies in Germany, in Italy, there's significant cash in the higher double digits that we're seeing that and we can go after and we will continue to go after. So I continue to expect a growth opportunity there. But it's also true that there are markets that are so highly digitized today that the secular opportunity in itself is something that from cash to check isn't really happening. And there, you come to the point about what are the emerging business models in a highly digitized world. The Nordics is a good example of that. There's a whole new set of business models coming up, and we're supporting those fintechs which is why Europe is one of the geographies around the world where we have a tremendous position in fintech and other market leaders in those partnerships. So I'm excited about the Europe outlook, and we continue to invest there. Bottom line.\nSachin Mehra: And David, on your question around cross-border in and out of Europe, a couple of thoughts around there. Look, I mean, globally, I would say we're well positioned from a cross-border standpoint. You can see that in our metrics. And then as it relates to Europe, back to what Michael just said, as we've been winning portfolios, there's been a mix of portfolios We've been there, some of which are high cross-border and others are lowered from a cross-border standpoint. The idea is to actually be in the flow, participate and create opportunities for ourselves to actually leverage our services, our loyalty assets in order to drive cross-border, whether it's Europe or anywhere else in the world. Last point I'll make is sensitivity to foreign exchange rates, right? Strong dollar certainly helps in terms of the inbound into Europe because you tend to see a lot more travel from the US actually show up in Europe as part of that process. So again, we feel good about the cross-border opportunity, not only in out of Europe, but globally for the company.\nMichael Miebach: Right. And one last point to add on -- based on the financial frame that Sachin just put around it, back to the R&I question. So in Europe, we really feel we are well positioned in the market from a share perspective. So this aspect of financial discipline as we continue to look for deals and partnerships in Europe really rises to the top.\nOperator: Next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDarrin Peller: Hey guys, thanks. It's good to see the stability into July and the US volume side. So if you could just help us understand a little more on the cadence if there's anything from CrowdStrike or weather? And then I guess, really, Michael, also, more importantly, just the ability for you guys to win these portfolios, if you could help us just remind us understanding what the driving factors are? How much of it is -- if there's any competitive pricing dynamics, how much of it might be just mass, maybe a little bit more of what you see ahead.\nSachin Mehra: Yes. Why don't I take the first part of that question, Darrin. In terms of the trends we've seen for the first four weeks of July, like I said, look, I mean, general stability and drivers across the board. And you can see that on Page 9 of our presentation. And really, I mean, to your question as to whether there was an impact from the events over with CrowdStrike or weather. I mean the reality is the weather piece has a little bit of an impact. That's what I would actually mention. But it's kind of muted in terms of the context that we've got now four weeks' worth of data in there. And so the reality is these things kind of happen, they come a particular week, if you look at it, it might look lower or higher and then there might be a catch-up factor which takes place as we tend to follow. By and large, we feel good about what we're seeing from a consumer spending standpoint, and that's reflective of what you see on the metrics right here.\nMichael Miebach: Right. And then the second part of your question, the [indiscernible] market in the US and same as Europe since we just talked about, remains incredibly competitive. I think we haven't seen such elevated level of competition and payments that we're currently seeing. You see a lot of movements in the market. There's banks looking at network opportunities and so forth. So there's a lot going on. But it's also true that for us, we continue to broaden our payment solutions and our service offerings. And really, that comes to that part of your question is what matters here. What matters here is that we can help our customers run their business in a better way. So what are they trying to do and our solutions helping data insights, cybersecurity certainly matter. The fact that cards isn't the best answer to all payments, but there is also a multi-rail set of solutions that customers are looking for. We have all of that. So that puts us in a differentiated position. We're trying to not to sell product but really come in with solutions through our sales force. That's working for us, but it's pretty clear. We have to be financially competitive. That always matters. But if you can have a conversation around the top line outcome with your customer vis-a-vis the cost of payments that changes the dialogue quite significantly. So when I talk to CEOs and the customer side, that's what they're really interested in. So that's working. That's a lot of value that we bring, and we price for that. So we continue to price for that. You've heard us mention pricing changes in the last quarter. So we do that wherever we see the opportunity. Tokenization is a great example. We've invested in tokenization and we needed to scale it up. Now we have an opportunity to build a whole set of services on top of the basic token that we can price for and that we feel we should price for because they drive a better outcome in terms of better approval rates, lower fraud and so forth for our customers. So I think we're well positioned in a very competitive market, and we're going to continue to try to keep that edge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Koning: Yes.Hey, guys. Thank you. And I guess my question on the cross-border line, you've had a very nice positive divergence between constant currency revenues and constant currency volumes. This quarter was about 4%. And I think for 13 quarters in a row, it's been nicely positive. In prior years, it was pretty close to neutral, sometimes even a little negative. Why does that continue to be positive? And how should we think of that going forward? Is that going to stay that nice positive divergence?\nSachin Mehra: Yes, David. So look, I mean, it's like I said, right, it's been driven by favorable mix and a little bit of pricing in the second quarter. The reality is that the mix piece is really what's been actually causing that positive divergence you're talking about. As you are aware, our cross-border volumes are -- and we show you the metrics on this. We have intra-Europe cross-border and then we have other cross-border. Intra-Europe is lower yielding, other cross-border is high yielding for us. And so as you think about this, if the other cross-border volumes are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe, you tend to see that positive divergence. I'll remind you, during COVID, we actually had the reverse phenomenon take place. We had intra-Europe growing faster than other cross-border and you actually had the reverse happening, which is you had cross-border assessment is growing at a slower clip than the actual underlying driver growth. So that's really what we mean by mix there. And then, of course, there's a pricing which we do back to the point Michael was making around the value we deliver, which is another contributing factor in the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, Sachin, could you just talk about the share gain benefits in the quarter and maybe what's on the horizon. I think you mentioned it in the context of incentives. And then just specific to some of the revenue items or revenue lines. When I look at domestic assessment revenue, that kind of slowed from a trend line that we've seen that was much stronger. I know some of it was FX. But was there anything else similar for other revenues. Those were down a little bit. I know it's a smaller line, but any call-outs there?\nSachin Mehra: So I'll take -- I think there are three questions there. So I'm going to take all three of them, which is -- on domestic assessments, it's -- the delta you're seeing in terms of domestic assessment is growing at 7% compared to GDP growing at 9%, and is primarily being driven by mix. I need to remind everybody that GDV and domestic assessments is not a perfect proxy, just because in domestic assessments, there's a whole bunch of other stuff which is there. You've got card fees. You've got a bunch of stuff going on in there. So there's always going to be some level of kind of difference in terms of growth rates there. But what we like to call out is what are the salient features or factors which are causing for that -- for the different growth rates between domestic assessments and GDV growth. And when I talk about mix there, just so that you're clear, I mean, the mix could come from a whole host of things. So for example, our GDV includes our cross-border volumes. Our domestic assessments do not include our cross-border-related revenues. And so what you've got is with GDV growing you don't have the associated cross-border revenue, which is there, which would come in terms of domestic assessments. You could also have changes in geographic mix. You've got high-yielding and lower-yielding regions and depending on the growth rate of regions, you might see deltas come to the positive or the negative there. So that, Sanjay, is the domestic assessment piece. On the other payment network revenues, again, look, I mean, this is not something which we are necessarily focused on as a business. That is -- it's one of the things which is required to run the network. It's a range of things from licensing fees, implementation fees, franchise fees, things of that sort. And those things move around. So I wouldn't get too fussed about the fact that in one quarter, it grows at an exceptional pace in the next quarter is actually going the opposite direction. Just because, first, the number is fairly small. And second, it's -- there's a whole host of reasons why that might happen. For example, as customers get more compliant, you might have less than the nature of compliance fees that you're charging them. So that's a good thing for the network, by the way, over the long term. And then the last point you asked, actually the first question you asked, which was around share gain benefits in the quarter -- the one I called out really was around the debit conversion in the US And we have previously announced this. We announced our win of the debit portfolio from citizens. We are super pleased with our relationship with citizens. That conversion is going exceptionally well. That conversion for the most part was complete in the second quarter. So we had new [ costs ] which were sent out to customers. So there's a little bit of that, which is there. Again, but what I wanted to share was that when we're looking at drivers, right, between Q2 and the first four weeks of July, or for that matter between Q1 and Q2. When you take out the impact of these share wins, there's still underlying stability in terms of consumer spending trends. On share gains, just so that you've got the overall picture, right? So we've talked a little bit about systems. We had the Webster win. You've got a whole bunch of stuff which will roll on, and those will be multiyear kind of conversions, which will come through. In particular, I'd call out UniCredit. So in UniCredit, we had announced this deal win in 2023. While that conversion is underway. That will be over a multiyear kind of time frame again. Deutsche Bank, again, the conversion is underway. It will take a couple of years before you actually start to set of completion of that. So all of these things will play out over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Just go ahead, your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you. Good results here. Just on the value-added services and solutions, that accelerated. I know there's an easy comp from the first quarter, but any interesting trends in terms of composition of growth within VAS and any call out for the second half of the year in terms of VAS growth?\nMichael Miebach: Right. Tien-Tsin, good to hear you. 19%, a strong growth rate for sure. The usual suspects in terms of driving for growth is the payments related part of this, particularly on the cybersecurity side. So that continues to grow and grow very well. So there's more need for more fraud solutions. That's one thing. And on the data analytics side, we continue to see great interest, as I laid out in remarks, test and learn, for example. So I'll give you a number of examples how customers are trying to figure out what kind of campaigns make sense, how can they serve their customers better and so forth. So no particular change there. I think the fundamental trend that I touched on earlier in an earlier response, more infusion of AI across the board to make these products scale better and be more effective, that's certainly a trend. Overall, the whole mix of this is largely unchanged. We continue to invest in newer aspects of our services portfolio, particularly in the open banking side. I talked through a couple of use cases here. They still have scale up in a significant way, but we feel we're well positioned in Europe, Australia and the US on the open banking side. So good to see. We said in the first quarter where we had a slightly lower growth rate. We're going to be higher quarter -- every single quarter for the rest of this year, and that is playing out as predicted. So occasionally, you have tougher comps and so forth, but this is a pretty solid trend for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Oh, hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question last quarter. I believe you gave us a cadence on rebates and incentives, growing slower in the second half versus the first half. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on to the cadence of rebates and incentives this year. And great results again.\nSachin Mehra: Dan, yes, last quarter, I shared with you a point of view around what we thought rebates and incentives would look like in the second quarter. And what we had said is it would be flat to slightly lower for the second quarter. And in the second quarter, rebates and incentives came in lower than the first quarter, lower than even what we had expected for the reasons which I mentioned earlier, which is the timing of deal activity. And then today, I shared with you what I think will be rebates and incentives in the third quarter, which we expect that rebates and incentives as a percentage of payment network assessments will be higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We really haven't shared much on nature of rebates and incentives beyond that. So really just for clarification, that's what I want to share with you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Michael, I want to ask about open banking and particularly in the US hearing some conflicting things about the price of real-time payments, interchange in real-time payments, I guess, versus debit, especially Durbin-regulated debit and perhaps the enthusiasm on consumers' behalf to pay from their bank accounts, but maybe some charge back and customer service dispute issues that banks are facing. I just wonder if you could maybe parse some of the puts and takes and give an outlook on the future of open banking, particularly in the US\nMichael Miebach: Right. So interesting, you call that out. I just mentioned that just before. And I said it's not quite where I think most market participants would have wished open banking got to over the years. And that applies, I think, globally. Here in the United States, when I look at open banking with a focus on particular services, a set of actions around account opening or account linking or data aggregation or things like that, we see good momentum. I talked about that earlier. When it comes to payments, the payment side of open banking, it's still true that the value that the card ecosystem brings is significant, and you made a point on chargebacks. That is -- it's not comfortable if there is a problem, and then there is no established way to get your money back. On cards, we do that. The same is for fraud protection. I think we know exactly how that works in the world of card payments. It's not so clear yet in the world of counter account payments. Nevertheless, it's our role as an ecosystem custodian to understand where emerging technologies are going, whereas customer interest going that consumers want to use their data footprint to get better services, well, absolutely. First of all, that starts with data protection and data consent management, which we invest a lot of energy on. But then to say, all right, how could this kind of technology be used. So we do invest in it, which is why we called out open banking as an element of kind of future-oriented activity for us and investment. What we currently see are those use cases that I mentioned, they are the most near-term opportunity. And this is around lending. It's around account Opening, account linking, asset verification, and more recently around data aggregation. Our smart subscription solution is one example of that. That works really well for consumers. If you got 15 subscriptions and you see them in one place and it makes a real difference. So I think it's evolving. It's evolving and we're at the forefront of evolving it, but we're also trying to make sure that it's understood that the value we bring through cards is really unparalleled.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fahed Kunwar from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFahed Kunwar: Hi both. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about profitability. Obviously, there's a lot of various moving parts with VAS growing really nicely, cross-border. How do you think about margin expansion, though versus kind of investing in all of these various product areas in distribution and the products themselves, should we expect margins to carry on expanding as they have been? Or will there be continued areas of investment that you think will kind of drive expenses higher from here?\nSachin Mehra: So a couple of thoughts here for you, which is, number one, I think we mentioned in the past and this philosophy of ours remains unchanged, which is we aspire to deliver positive operating leverage, which is showing -- driving net revenue growth at a faster clip than operating expense growth over the long term. So that's really what the aspiration is for how we're running the business. The most important thing to remember is we're running the business for top line growth and bottom line growth. And in order to do that, we keep a very close eye on making investments to drive growth in the near term, medium term and long term. So yes, we are investing in things which will drive growth in the near, medium and long term. That is super essential from our perspective, not only because that's what our shareholders desire, but also because we believe the set of opportunities in front of us are sizable. And so for us to leave those opportunities underinvested would be a bad move for the long-term health of our company. So we will continue to invest in the business. We will do that with the strategic priorities, which Michael has laid out. With that focus, we will constantly look at those priorities to see how the market conditions are evolving, and we will pivot as necessary. But the general kind of flow is, yes, we will continue to invest in the growth of our business because we see tremendous opportunity on a going-forward basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Golding from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Golding: Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about AI in a fraud sense. I know that you're incorporating AI into your products and presumably as part of VAS to combat fraud. Just wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of the offense of fraud using AI and how that might accelerate the adoption of your new products and your investment in new products around AI to combat that.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So with rapid digitization around the world, we've seen a lot of new entrants into the ecosystem. A lot of small businesses have digitized post-COVID as you see in emerging markets, a lot of people for the first time using digital solutions. So digitalization is growing, vulnerabilities are growing and technology in the hands of fraudsters is also evolving. So this makes for an environment where players like ourselves who oversee an ecosystem, a franchise between banks and merchants and for the benefit of the end consumer need to really invest in safety and security. We've done that. And AI isn't actually anything new for us. So we've -- for the better part of a decade, we've been using AI. This is a discrete machine learning technology to really predict where is the next problem and analyze data of -- that we have and the data that our customers have to prevent fraud. So that's been very successful. As far as generative AI is concerned, evolving technology here, there's obviously an opportunity for us to understand more data in a quicker way. And we have used that initially to you to train our AI models, our discriminative AI models using generative AI to create artificial data set. So that was the first step. And then we went into putting out a new set of products. I mentioned Decision Intelligence. Our Decision Intelligence is that we've had for a long time, machine learning driven that was predicting fraud outcomes and now we're using more data sets to -- that are externally available, stole the card data and so forth to understand where our fraud vulnerabilities might be. The lift is tremendous, 20%, we see in terms of effectiveness out of that product. So we start to see demand for the whole reason on the vulnerabilities that I talked about. So we expect continued growth. We also expect the fraudsters to come up with new techniques themselves, we need to continue to evolve. So I believe that the penetration of generative AI and our fraud and cybersecurity product that will only expand. Now I talked a lot about transaction-related fraud. The vectors around cybersecurity, obviously much broader. It's prediction of fraud. It is what's the general cybersecurity posture of a company, risk recon capabilities and so forth. We try to cover the whole ecosystem and become a true strategic partner of our customers. So if anything, this whole space is going to grow further, and you're going to continue to see us invest in that area.\nDevin Corr: We time for one more question, Julianne.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Schmidt: Hi, Michael. Hey, Sachin, thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to double-click on macro viewpoint. If I hear in the message correctly, it sounds like not mix, but consumer spend trends are stable for the most part. If you could just double click on that and let us know if there's any divergence amongst different consumer demographics and correspondingly what that might mean for debit versus credit, transaction sizes, anything like that, that would be super helpful.\nMichael Miebach: Right. So at the outset of my prepared remarks, I talked about the puts and takes on inflation, on the prices. The bottom line there is that for now, the consumer is supported, and that's pretty much irrelevant of income cohort, is supported by a strong labor market. So that's fundamentally true, and it's fundamentally true around the world. But it's in aggregate, but it's not a uniform answer. The picture obviously plays out very differently country-by-country. We have a very global business. So we look at what is the Central Bank of Japan doing and we saw that today. They raised rates. And then Europe, you see Germany came through with actually a small recession in the past quarter. So there's a lot of back and forth. But that fundamental point that the consumer is supported by a strong labor market and some wage growth. I think that's true, and we don't expect any dramatic changes on that front, and that's why we remain positive about the outlook. You peel the onion a bit further, you look into different cohorts. And it's pretty clear that when it comes to higher income versus lower income, if you spend on an expensive trip or an experiences during the summer, whatever you're trying to do, you have more income, then you can do more of that and you have less income and you can do less of that. What we generally see though as a function of the digital economy. The higher-end consumer, but certainly the mid-income and lower-income consumer is much more empowered, empowered by having more data and the ability to look for a better deal. And that's what everybody is trying to do to make things add up and work for them that they still want to do that trip. So all of that together overall adds up to a picture that we feel pretty good, at least about our side of the business. And why do I say that? Because inflation and prices cut across carded and non-carded. But we are obviously particularly positioned. So you saw that rise. And right now, you see a lot of inflation in auto insurance and rent. That's not necessarily so much carded. So these are all the things that we think through comes back down to the fundamental point in aggregate, we see healthy consumer spending and don't see that changing in the short term.\nSachin Mehra: And Andrew, I'll just add one point, and Michael touched on this before, which is at the end of the day, our diversified business model lends really well in different environments because at the end of the day, right, we are geographically diversified. We've got great diversification across debit and credit. We've got good diversification around channels of spend. So the reality is when these puts and takes take place in certain sectors of the economy, a dollar spent on one sector versus the dollar spent on the other sector, we're relatively indifferent so long as it's got to spend. And that diversification really helps our business the way we are actually structured, which has not happened by chat. It's happened by design. And so that's something which is super important for us.\nDevin Corr: Thank you. Now I'll hand it back to Michael for any closing comments.\nMichael Miebach: All right. Thanks, Devin. So everybody past, we talked about the momentum and a good quarter. all of this obviously only happens because it takes the hard work of our colleagues at Mastercard, I thank them, and I also want to thank you for your support for Mastercard. We're looking forward to speak to you in a quarter from now and hopefully see some of you at our Investor Day Community Meeting on November 13 in New York. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 13%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 10%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 15%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 24% and 27%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a lower tax rate in the current quarter compared to Q2, 2023, primarily due to a sizable discrete tax expense in the prior year as well as the change in the geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $3.59, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion worth of stock and an additional $820 million through July 26, 2024. So let's turn to Page 4, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the second quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, increased by 9% year-over-year. In the US, GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 7%. Debit growth was aided by the conversion of a previously announced debit win in the US Outside of the US, volume increased 11% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 11%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending. Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q2, both card present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 69% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 7%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards are issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the second quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 9%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives, which were lower than anticipated, primarily due to the timing of planned deal activity. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 19%, primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers Strong demand for our consulting, data analytics and marketing services and the scaling of our fraud and security and our identity and authentication solutions. Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%, primarily due to mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 17%, the four ppt difference is primarily driven by mix and pricing. Transaction processing assessments were up 13%, while switch transactions grew 11%. The two ppt difference is primarily due to mix and pricing. Other network assessments were $244 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend within the year. Turning to Page 9. Let me comment on the operating metric trends in the second quarter and then through the first four weeks of July. As a reminder, our Q1 switch metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over one ppt to growth across each of switched volumes, switch transactions and cross-border volumes. In addition, our switch metrics in Q1 and April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After adjusting for the leap year, the timing of Easter and excluding the benefit from the US debit portfolio when I previously discussed, our switch metrics in Q2 were generally stable sequentially in the US and across the globe. Looking at the first four weeks of July, trends remained generally stable versus Q2. Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. As Michael said, there are a number of economic headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we remain focused on executing on our strategy. Business fundamentals remain strong as evidenced by the results we delivered this quarter across all aspects of our business. Our diversified business model underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the continued secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions continues to position us well for the opportunities ahead. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. Now turning to Q3, 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate while we expect a one to two ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 operating expense growth to be at the low double-digit range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We expect higher growth in advertising and marketing in Q3 compared to the first half of the year primarily driven by the cadence of spend related to our sponsorship activities. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this OpEx growth for the quarter, while we expect a 0 to one ppt tailwind from foreign exchange. Separately, as Michael mentioned, as part of our recent reorganization, we expect to record a onetime restructuring charge in Q3 of approximately $190 million. This will be recorded as a special item and excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. We expect these actions will free up capacity to further invest in our strategic priorities as we continue to execute on our growth algorithm. We also expect they will contribute to delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. As it relates to the full year we expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year, and foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately one ppt for the year. In terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth for the year. Other items to keep in mind. On other income and expenses, in Q3, we expect an expense of approximately $100 million. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 17% and 18% for Q3 and 17% to 17.5% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. One last point. I wanted to let you know that we are planning to host an Investor Day in New York on November 13. We look forward to discussing our future plans with you at that time. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Sure. Thanks, Trevor. So you're right. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our rebates and incentives did come in slightly lower than our expectations for the second quarter. I just want to kind of take it up a level, just to kind of remind everybody, we're very active in the markets. We are constantly looking at what opportunities exist with existing customers and then with who could be potential new customers. And we have a view on what our pipeline of activities is. So the vast majority of what we had in the nature of better or, I would say, lower rebates and incentives in the second quarter were driven by some of those -- that deal activity not materializing in the second quarter. It still remains in the pipeline. It's still something we expect will occur as the year progresses. And then more specifically, as it relates to Q3, we expect that our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments will be higher than it was in Q2. And it's essentially based on exactly what I just said, which is it's a very rich deal pipeline that we have. And again, this is more of a timing issue than anything else. And David, on your question around cross-border in and out of Europe, a couple of thoughts around there. Look, I mean, globally, I would say we're well positioned from a cross-border standpoint. You can see that in our metrics. And then as it relates to Europe, back to what Michael just said, as we've been winning portfolios, there's been a mix of portfolios We've been there, some of which are high cross-border and others are lowered from a cross-border standpoint. The idea is to actually be in the flow, participate and create opportunities for ourselves to actually leverage our services, our loyalty assets in order to drive cross-border, whether it's Europe or anywhere else in the world. Last point I'll make is sensitivity to foreign exchange rates, right? Strong dollar certainly helps in terms of the inbound into Europe because you tend to see a lot more travel from the US actually show up in Europe as part of that process. So again, we feel good about the cross-border opportunity, not only in out of Europe, but globally for the company. Yes. Why don't I take the first part of that question, Darrin. In terms of the trends we've seen for the first four weeks of July, like I said, look, I mean, general stability and drivers across the board. And you can see that on Page 9 of our presentation. And really, I mean, to your question as to whether there was an impact from the events over with CrowdStrike or weather. I mean the reality is the weather piece has a little bit of an impact. That's what I would actually mention. But it's kind of muted in terms of the context that we've got now four weeks' worth of data in there. And so the reality is these things kind of happen, they come a particular week, if you look at it, it might look lower or higher and then there might be a catch-up factor which takes place as we tend to follow. By and large, we feel good about what we're seeing from a consumer spending standpoint, and that's reflective of what you see on the metrics right here. Yes, David. So look, I mean, it's like I said, right, it's been driven by favorable mix and a little bit of pricing in the second quarter. The reality is that the mix piece is really what's been actually causing that positive divergence you're talking about. As you are aware, our cross-border volumes are -- and we show you the metrics on this. We have intra-Europe cross-border and then we have other cross-border. Intra-Europe is lower yielding, other cross-border is high yielding for us. And so as you think about this, if the other cross-border volumes are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe, you tend to see that positive divergence. I'll remind you, during COVID, we actually had the reverse phenomenon take place. We had intra-Europe growing faster than other cross-border and you actually had the reverse happening, which is you had cross-border assessment is growing at a slower clip than the actual underlying driver growth. So that's really what we mean by mix there. And then, of course, there's a pricing which we do back to the point Michael was making around the value we deliver, which is another contributing factor in the second quarter. So I'll take -- I think there are three questions there. So I'm going to take all three of them, which is -- on domestic assessments, it's -- the delta you're seeing in terms of domestic assessment is growing at 7% compared to GDP growing at 9%, and is primarily being driven by mix. I need to remind everybody that GDV and domestic assessments is not a perfect proxy, just because in domestic assessments, there's a whole bunch of other stuff which is there. You've got card fees. You've got a bunch of stuff going on in there. So there's always going to be some level of kind of difference in terms of growth rates there. But what we like to call out is what are the salient features or factors which are causing for that -- for the different growth rates between domestic assessments and GDV growth. And when I talk about mix there, just so that you're clear, I mean, the mix could come from a whole host of things. So for example, our GDV includes our cross-border volumes. Our domestic assessments do not include our cross-border-related revenues. And so what you've got is with GDV growing you don't have the associated cross-border revenue, which is there, which would come in terms of domestic assessments. You could also have changes in geographic mix. You've got high-yielding and lower-yielding regions and depending on the growth rate of regions, you might see deltas come to the positive or the negative there. So that, Sanjay, is the domestic assessment piece. On the other payment network revenues, again, look, I mean, this is not something which we are necessarily focused on as a business. That is -- it's one of the things which is required to run the network. It's a range of things from licensing fees, implementation fees, franchise fees, things of that sort. And those things move around. So I wouldn't get too fussed about the fact that in one quarter, it grows at an exceptional pace in the next quarter is actually going the opposite direction. Just because, first, the number is fairly small. And second, it's -- there's a whole host of reasons why that might happen. For example, as customers get more compliant, you might have less than the nature of compliance fees that you're charging them. So that's a good thing for the network, by the way, over the long term. And then the last point you asked, actually the first question you asked, which was around share gain benefits in the quarter -- the one I called out really was around the debit conversion in the US And we have previously announced this. We announced our win of the debit portfolio from citizens. We are super pleased with our relationship with citizens. That conversion is going exceptionally well. That conversion for the most part was complete in the second quarter. So we had new [ costs ] which were sent out to customers. So there's a little bit of that, which is there. Again, but what I wanted to share was that when we're looking at drivers, right, between Q2 and the first four weeks of July, or for that matter between Q1 and Q2. When you take out the impact of these share wins, there's still underlying stability in terms of consumer spending trends. On share gains, just so that you've got the overall picture, right? So we've talked a little bit about systems. We had the Webster win. You've got a whole bunch of stuff which will roll on, and those will be multiyear kind of conversions, which will come through. In particular, I'd call out UniCredit. So in UniCredit, we had announced this deal win in 2023. While that conversion is underway. That will be over a multiyear kind of time frame again. Deutsche Bank, again, the conversion is underway. It will take a couple of years before you actually start to set of completion of that. So all of these things will play out over time. Dan, yes, last quarter, I shared with you a point of view around what we thought rebates and incentives would look like in the second quarter. And what we had said is it would be flat to slightly lower for the second quarter. And in the second quarter, rebates and incentives came in lower than the first quarter, lower than even what we had expected for the reasons which I mentioned earlier, which is the timing of deal activity. And then today, I shared with you what I think will be rebates and incentives in the third quarter, which we expect that rebates and incentives as a percentage of payment network assessments will be higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We really haven't shared much on nature of rebates and incentives beyond that. So really just for clarification, that's what I want to share with you. So a couple of thoughts here for you, which is, number one, I think we mentioned in the past and this philosophy of ours remains unchanged, which is we aspire to deliver positive operating leverage, which is showing -- driving net revenue growth at a faster clip than operating expense growth over the long term. So that's really what the aspiration is for how we're running the business. The most important thing to remember is we're running the business for top line growth and bottom line growth. And in order to do that, we keep a very close eye on making investments to drive growth in the near term, medium term and long term. So yes, we are investing in things which will drive growth in the near, medium and long term. That is super essential from our perspective, not only because that's what our shareholders desire, but also because we believe the set of opportunities in front of us are sizable. And so for us to leave those opportunities underinvested would be a bad move for the long-term health of our company. So we will continue to invest in the business. We will do that with the strategic priorities, which Michael has laid out. With that focus, we will constantly look at those priorities to see how the market conditions are evolving, and we will pivot as necessary. But the general kind of flow is, yes, we will continue to invest in the growth of our business because we see tremendous opportunity on a going-forward basis. And Andrew, I'll just add one point, and Michael touched on this before, which is at the end of the day, our diversified business model lends really well in different environments because at the end of the day, right, we are geographically diversified. We've got great diversification across debit and credit. We've got good diversification around channels of spend. So the reality is when these puts and takes take place in certain sectors of the economy, a dollar spent on one sector versus the dollar spent on the other sector, we're relatively indifferent so long as it's got to spend. And that diversification really helps our business the way we are actually structured, which has not happened by chat. It's happened by design. And so that's something which is super important for us."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning everyone. The headline this quarter we delivered very strong results powered by broad based momentum across all aspects of our business. Second quarter net revenues were up 13% and adjusted net income up 24% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP, currency neutral basis. These results were underpinned by healthy consumer spending, including strong cross border volume growth of 17% year-over-year on a local currency basis and value added services and solutions. Net revenue grew 19% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. The macroeconomic environment remains mixed and we continue to monitor the positives and negatives. A few to note, strength in consumer spending continues to be supported by a solid labor market and wage growth. While there are some signs of labor market growth moderating, this is off very strong levels of job creation, as in also, inflation and interest rates remain in focus. We've seen inflation cool, but to varying degrees across carded and non-carded categories. Price levels are still elevated for many goods and services. Interest rates also remain elevated, but many central banks have started to ease and economic indicators support broader rate reductions. While tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain on balance, we remain positive about our growth outlook, but that as a backdrop, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm across core payments, new payment flows and services. You may remember that we recently announced organizational changes to further increase our focus on these priorities. They included the realignment of both regional operations and payments and services to support our growth algorithm. These changes were designed to accelerate growth and unlock capacity to invest in long-term business opportunities. This also helps us continue to deliver positive operating leverage over the long-term. For example, we plan to redeploy resources into growth markets with high cash levels. We will invest in opening acceptance in new verticals, and we will continue to apply technology to help us realize even more of the shift to digital across both consumer and commercial. We will also enhance and expand our value added services, such as in data analytics, fraud and cybersecurity, particularly as we further embed AI into our products and services. As a result of this organizational realignment, which positions us well for the long-term growth, we expect to incur a onetime restructuring charge in the third quarter. Now, moving on to an update on some specific elements of our growth algorithm. In payments, we're driving growth by winning and retaining deals, and we're tapping into the vast secular shift opportunity by expanding in new geographies and further digitizing the payments ecosystem. Let's start with our continued deal momentum. I'm happy to announce that Varo Bank will convert their debit and credit portfolios to Mastercard. They were the first all digital bank to receive a national charter in the United States. Varo chose Mastercard due to our differentiated data insights, merchant funded offers platform and our ability to seamlessly integrate into their technology stack. We extended our enterprise agreement with Wells Fargo and partnered to launch the Attune World Elite Mastercard. This is our first proprietary consumer credit program with the bank. We also want to renew deals this quarter with key US prepaid partners, including our H&R Block, Blackhawk network, relevate and dash solutions. In aggregate, these partnerships will drive meaningful increase in our US prepaid market share. In Canada, we extended our longstanding partnership with the National Bank of Canada across consumer credit, commercial and prepaid for the next decade. And PostaPay, who already issues millions of Mastercard cards in Italy, has expanded our collaboration to drive additional growth across debit and prepaid. Let's deep dive into a few specific verticals and geographies. Travel is, of course a key focus. It has strong growth potential and a meaningful cross border component. Travel is also a natural fit with our virtual car technology and our marketing loyalty and consulting capabilities. We executed several new travel partnerships this quarter. We signed a deal with global digital payments provider checkout.com to enable them to deploy their virtual card issuing solution to their online travel agency customers. We also announced a multi-year agreement with Wells Fargo and Expedia to launch two new co-brand cards with a range of unique travel benefits. And we executed a new co-brand deal with Dashen and Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline in Africa.This builds on a co-brand deal with RwandAir and INM Rwanda that we initiated earlier this year. I'm sure it wasn't lost on you that these two last deals I mentioned are in Africa. The continent is a great example of the vast secular opportunity in emerging markets. External sources estimate that approximately 90% of transactions in Africa are made in cash. We are committed to the digital transformation of the regions and we're doing so by ranking up our investments, developing new partnerships and rapidly expanding our acceptance footprint. For example, Africa is the world's largest adopter of mobile money accounts. Our partnerships with large Telco's and mobile network operators like Airtel, MTN, Vodafone Egypt and others put us in a great position to accelerate inclusion and cash conversion. On the acceptance front, we've more than tripled the number of acceptance locations in Africa over the last five years. We recently signed deals with the Commercial bank of Ethiopia, the largest bank in the country, and I&M Bank in Kenya. These partnerships will enable us to increase share in both markets. In Nigeria and Ghana In Nigeria and Ghana, we partner with BlueSoft Financial, who will work with fintechs across the region to issue Mastercard cards. Also, our Mastercard move capabilities are the foundation for a new cross-border money movement solution with Access Bank Group. Together, we're enabling businesses and consumers in several African markets to send and receive international payments across over 140 countries. Now this secular opportunity is not limited to Africa, we see opportunities around the globe. Think about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Fully capitalizing on that secular trend requires that we continue to innovate to support the digital economy at scale, and we're doing just that. We're enhancing the checkout experience and expanding our tap-on-phone acceptance capabilities. We're scaling our contactless technology in areas like transit, and we are driving the ongoing conversion of Maestro to Debit Mastercard. Let's dig into one, online shopping. It must be simple and it must work on all devices and all channels. That's why we are leaning into a new area of one-click payments. We announced that we will phase out manual card entry for e-commerce payments in Europe by 2030 in favor of a one-click checkout button. There are three foundational components to this effort, all anchored on driving simplicity and security. First, tokenization. Tokenization replaces payment credentials with a digitally secure token. When deployed, fraud rates decrease and approval rates improve. So launching a decade ago, the technology has been broadly adopted around the world. In fact, we surpassed $22 billion tokenized transactions in the first half of 2024, up 49% versus a year ago. Second is Click to Pay. Click to Pay simplifies online guest checkout by eliminating the need to manually enter payment credentials. Guest checkout becomes as easy as remembering your e-mail address. It also makes checkout more secure using the token technology I just mentioned. We are working with our merchants and bank partners to drive adoption. Click to Pay transactions more than doubled year-over-year in the first half of 2024. And third, up payment passes. Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords or text for onetime pass cold. They allow consumers to authenticate online, purchases using a fingerprint or facial features that you use every day when opening your phone. When combined, these powerful technologies are enabling us to deliver on our promise of a simple and secure one-click online checkout experience for consumers. We also continue to enhance in-store checkout. For example, we are scaling our biometric checkout program to new regions. In Europe, we're partnering with Polish Fintech payee to allow shoppers to pay with a simple glance. And in Latin America, we are working with Ingenico, so that consumers that participate in supermarkets can pay with a wave. We're also working at pace to migrate Maestro cards to Debit Mastercard outside the United States. Shifting to Debit Mastercard is a critical element of our strategy as we see a 2x spend lift on cards once they are migrated. This is primarily due to the ability to capture both cross-border and online spend on debit Mastercard. The first half of 2024, we converted over 14 million cards, which brings us to almost 300 million cards migrated since 2016. These innovations are examples of the investments we are making to differentiate the MasterCard experience versus other payment methods like P2P or local payment schemes. We also continue to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new payment flows. Today, I will focus on commercial, starting with accounts payable payments. We are operating from a position of strength. Our market-leading virtual card capabilities have been deployed with over 90 issuers worldwide. Additionally, we are integrating our technology into four of the top five leading global procure-to-pay solution providers, completed the integration of our virtual card technology into Oracle Cloud ERP and commenced invoice payments for the first HSBC corporate customer in US. On the supplier side, we signed several acquirers onto Mastercard receivables managers. This includes Elavon, whose customers are using our AI-powered platform to streamline the process of accepting virtual cards. We also continue to expand distribution of our virtual cards, signing new deals with Brex and ad groups world first. On commercial point of sale, we're increasing the distribution of our commercial card products worldwide. In the US, the Wells Fargo small business credit card portfolio migration is now complete. In Europe, we've extended our partnership with Virgin Money to continue growing our small business portfolio, and our partnership with SAP Concur, which automatically integrates our corporate card data into Concur expense is yielding results. Large insurer Score awarded their T&E card program to Mastercard based on the value delivered through this joint offering. And finally, we're executing against our strategy to penetrate new B2B verticals. This quarter, we signed an exclusive partnership with Latin America, with CBC, the largest Pepsi distributor in the region, and the fintech enabler YalloTech Migo payments. This partnership will provide car distribution acceptance and financial education to almost two million retailers. These small businesses can now use their Mastercard small business cards to purchase inventory and other items. In the health care space, we signed an exclusive partnership with the Medical Tourism Association. They will now accept cards from consumers and utilize virtual cards to make cross-border payments to medical providers. Separately, we are working with Square to broaden card acceptance amongst smaller health care providers in the U.K. Now turning to services, payments support our services and vice versa. Services played an important part in winning many of the deals I just mentioned. And the strong payments drivers helped fuel services growth. That, coupled with strong demand drove 19% value-add services and solutions net revenue growth in the second quarter on a year-over-year currency neutral basis, this is our powerful flywheel turning. I'm excited about our momentum and the future potential whether it's deepening penetration of existing customers, launching new capabilities or distributing our services in new ways and across new customer and transaction types. A few examples. First, our services help to improve MasterCard issuer portfolio performance, thereby supporting our customers' core business objectives. For example, SEB in the Baltics is building their customer loyalty strategy together with Mastercard and Revolut is working with us to develop and execute their marketing strategy, launching campaigns across the U.K., Ireland and Italy. We're also deploying our services across non-FIs, helping to diversify our business and capture a new set of growth opportunities. Customers as varied as Paramount and McDonald's in Taiwan are using our test and learn capabilities to address core business needs, including media measurement and new product introductions. And we're working with LATAM Airlines in Brazil to optimize their co-brand portfolio and develop innovative marketing campaigns. We're partnering to distribute our capabilities in new and more efficient ways, Salesforce has integrated our dispute resolution services into its financial services cloud. This enables banks and other financial institutions to handle disputes and prevent chargebacks more effectively. And KPMG Norway has partnered with the Norwegian government to distribute our risk recount capabilities. The solution will help hundreds of local governments evaluate their cyber risk posture and that of their suppliers. Turning to open banking, we continue to make strong progress in scaling new use cases. I'll use our account opening and account linking use case as an example. Klarna in the US is now using Mastercard's open banking for this purpose. PayPal will leverage account linking, balance check and transaction history for their wallet in the US and Jack Henry will distribute these capabilities to streamline the account opening process for hundreds of issuers they support. So with that, I'll wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We're driving growth by winning and retaining deals, we're penetrating the substantial secular opportunity, and we continue to see strong demand for our services. Now our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead of us. Sachin, over to you. Right. Thanks, Harshita. You're not asking about the secular opportunity. I know the same. So the merchant settlement. So the first thing I would say is we're disappointed where this has landed for now. And I would describe it as we respectfully disagree with the court's ruling to reject the settlement. This has been negotiated over many years across many parties. I think with best intentions, and they would have produced a lot of benefits for consumers, for merchants and across all parties. So this is now not happening. We are obviously ready and we will take all efforts to ensure that a solution is found before it goes to trial, engage our parties. We've done this in previous scenarios before. It's difficult to speculate our outcomes at this point. But I think this intention to lean in and see how we can provide more security predictability to merchants and to banks and our parties here is what's driving us. So there's a number of co-defendants in this, and everybody will obviously take their own decisions here. But across the board, obviously, there has to be a dialogue and we find the best outcome of this. It comes back to the point. In the end, we want to be in the transactional floor. We want to be relevant to our customers. We want to be relevant in the eyes of the consumers that they have a Mastercard product in their hand, and we fight for the deals that we find strategically relevant that also meet our financial criteria. In the end, it all has to add up in combination between payments and services that our net revenue yield develops positively and that we keep in focus. Right, Dan. So as I said earlier, the idea here is to accelerate growth. The idea is not to reposition our strategy. We've articulated our strategy. You'll hear more of that in the investor community meeting in November and how we see that play out in more detail across our core payment solutions, new flows and the services portfolio. I purposefully stated the point on markets with high cash penetration. So here is as I laid out in the context of Africa, but there's more in other emerging markets around the world, there's a tremendous opportunity here. So we want to strengthen our front line. It's also clear that the recipe to participate in the secular opportunity emerging markets isn't the same as in developed markets. So we're investing in product and so forth. It's pretty clear that on the services side, as far as the areas of focus are concerned. We continue to be guided by underlying strong secular trends, and one of that is for really any of our corporate partners and B2B partners that they want to make sense of their enterprise data and make better decisions. And how do we do that? We do that by leveraging our artificial intelligence solutions set of assistance, a set of fine-tuning how they could have more personalized suggestions to their end consumers, et cetera, et cetera. That's one part, help our customers make better decisions, not changing, but very specific solutions with a higher weightage to AI. And then on the security side and the cybersecurity side, all of this data has to be kept safe. We kept saying that for years. That's a strong secular trend in itself, and making sure that we fine-tune our solutions here. We've got to move faster because the bad guys are also moving faster, and they have the similar technology tools at their hand now. So leveraging artificial intelligence, an example I gave last quarter around Decision Intelligence Pro, that's predicting what is the next card that might be frauded. Before it actually happens, those kind of solutions provide significant lift to our customers in terms of preventing fraud obviously giving peace of mind to their consumers and overall helping our business, and it's a close link to our payments underlying payments business. So all of that -- it's largely the same strategy, but we're really focusing on very specific aspects of that, and there are other aspects of our portfolio that we're going to dial down as a result of this effort. Right. So let me start. I want to anchor on what you -- how you framed your question. It's been a strong growth story for us in Europe. That's Continental Europe as well as the U.K. We've seen tremendous share growth there. And that's really focusing down and investing more locally in Europe, have a better presence there, engage with national governments as well as with European institutions, which we feel very European and Europe. That's the first thing I would say. When I come back to the times of COVID, it was -- there was a large set of economies in Europe that were lagging, I would argue on the digitization front, changing behaviors to consumers have increased the pressure to digitize further, and it has happened. So we've seen Europe catch up and obviously shows in our numbers. But back to the point of secular opportunity we just discussed. If you look at the economies in Germany, in Italy, there's significant cash in the higher double digits that we're seeing that and we can go after and we will continue to go after. So I continue to expect a growth opportunity there. But it's also true that there are markets that are so highly digitized today that the secular opportunity in itself is something that from cash to check isn't really happening. And there, you come to the point about what are the emerging business models in a highly digitized world. The Nordics is a good example of that. There's a whole new set of business models coming up, and we're supporting those fintechs which is why Europe is one of the geographies around the world where we have a tremendous position in fintech and other market leaders in those partnerships. So I'm excited about the Europe outlook, and we continue to invest there. Bottom line. Right. And one last point to add on -- based on the financial frame that Sachin just put around it, back to the R&I question. So in Europe, we really feel we are well positioned in the market from a share perspective. So this aspect of financial discipline as we continue to look for deals and partnerships in Europe really rises to the top. Right. And then the second part of your question, the [indiscernible] market in the US and same as Europe since we just talked about, remains incredibly competitive. I think we haven't seen such elevated level of competition and payments that we're currently seeing. You see a lot of movements in the market. There's banks looking at network opportunities and so forth. So there's a lot going on. But it's also true that for us, we continue to broaden our payment solutions and our service offerings. And really, that comes to that part of your question is what matters here. What matters here is that we can help our customers run their business in a better way. So what are they trying to do and our solutions helping data insights, cybersecurity certainly matter. The fact that cards isn't the best answer to all payments, but there is also a multi-rail set of solutions that customers are looking for. We have all of that. So that puts us in a differentiated position. We're trying to not to sell product but really come in with solutions through our sales force. That's working for us, but it's pretty clear. We have to be financially competitive. That always matters. But if you can have a conversation around the top line outcome with your customer vis-a-vis the cost of payments that changes the dialogue quite significantly. So when I talk to CEOs and the customer side, that's what they're really interested in. So that's working. That's a lot of value that we bring, and we price for that. So we continue to price for that. You've heard us mention pricing changes in the last quarter. So we do that wherever we see the opportunity. Tokenization is a great example. We've invested in tokenization and we needed to scale it up. Now we have an opportunity to build a whole set of services on top of the basic token that we can price for and that we feel we should price for because they drive a better outcome in terms of better approval rates, lower fraud and so forth for our customers. So I think we're well positioned in a very competitive market, and we're going to continue to try to keep that edge. Right. Tien-Tsin, good to hear you. 19%, a strong growth rate for sure. The usual suspects in terms of driving for growth is the payments related part of this, particularly on the cybersecurity side. So that continues to grow and grow very well. So there's more need for more fraud solutions. That's one thing. And on the data analytics side, we continue to see great interest, as I laid out in remarks, test and learn, for example. So I'll give you a number of examples how customers are trying to figure out what kind of campaigns make sense, how can they serve their customers better and so forth. So no particular change there. I think the fundamental trend that I touched on earlier in an earlier response, more infusion of AI across the board to make these products scale better and be more effective, that's certainly a trend. Overall, the whole mix of this is largely unchanged. We continue to invest in newer aspects of our services portfolio, particularly in the open banking side. I talked through a couple of use cases here. They still have scale up in a significant way, but we feel we're well positioned in Europe, Australia and the US on the open banking side. So good to see. We said in the first quarter where we had a slightly lower growth rate. We're going to be higher quarter -- every single quarter for the rest of this year, and that is playing out as predicted. So occasionally, you have tougher comps and so forth, but this is a pretty solid trend for us. Right. So interesting, you call that out. I just mentioned that just before. And I said it's not quite where I think most market participants would have wished open banking got to over the years. And that applies, I think, globally. Here in the United States, when I look at open banking with a focus on particular services, a set of actions around account opening or account linking or data aggregation or things like that, we see good momentum. I talked about that earlier. When it comes to payments, the payment side of open banking, it's still true that the value that the card ecosystem brings is significant, and you made a point on chargebacks. That is -- it's not comfortable if there is a problem, and then there is no established way to get your money back. On cards, we do that. The same is for fraud protection. I think we know exactly how that works in the world of card payments. It's not so clear yet in the world of counter account payments. Nevertheless, it's our role as an ecosystem custodian to understand where emerging technologies are going, whereas customer interest going that consumers want to use their data footprint to get better services, well, absolutely. First of all, that starts with data protection and data consent management, which we invest a lot of energy on. But then to say, all right, how could this kind of technology be used. So we do invest in it, which is why we called out open banking as an element of kind of future-oriented activity for us and investment. What we currently see are those use cases that I mentioned, they are the most near-term opportunity. And this is around lending. It's around account Opening, account linking, asset verification, and more recently around data aggregation. Our smart subscription solution is one example of that. That works really well for consumers. If you got 15 subscriptions and you see them in one place and it makes a real difference. So I think it's evolving. It's evolving and we're at the forefront of evolving it, but we're also trying to make sure that it's understood that the value we bring through cards is really unparalleled. Right. So with rapid digitization around the world, we've seen a lot of new entrants into the ecosystem. A lot of small businesses have digitized post-COVID as you see in emerging markets, a lot of people for the first time using digital solutions. So digitalization is growing, vulnerabilities are growing and technology in the hands of fraudsters is also evolving. So this makes for an environment where players like ourselves who oversee an ecosystem, a franchise between banks and merchants and for the benefit of the end consumer need to really invest in safety and security. We've done that. And AI isn't actually anything new for us. So we've -- for the better part of a decade, we've been using AI. This is a discrete machine learning technology to really predict where is the next problem and analyze data of -- that we have and the data that our customers have to prevent fraud. So that's been very successful. As far as generative AI is concerned, evolving technology here, there's obviously an opportunity for us to understand more data in a quicker way. And we have used that initially to you to train our AI models, our discriminative AI models using generative AI to create artificial data set. So that was the first step. And then we went into putting out a new set of products. I mentioned Decision Intelligence. Our Decision Intelligence is that we've had for a long time, machine learning driven that was predicting fraud outcomes and now we're using more data sets to -- that are externally available, stole the card data and so forth to understand where our fraud vulnerabilities might be. The lift is tremendous, 20%, we see in terms of effectiveness out of that product. So we start to see demand for the whole reason on the vulnerabilities that I talked about. So we expect continued growth. We also expect the fraudsters to come up with new techniques themselves, we need to continue to evolve. So I believe that the penetration of generative AI and our fraud and cybersecurity product that will only expand. Now I talked a lot about transaction-related fraud. The vectors around cybersecurity, obviously much broader. It's prediction of fraud. It is what's the general cybersecurity posture of a company, risk recon capabilities and so forth. We try to cover the whole ecosystem and become a true strategic partner of our customers. So if anything, this whole space is going to grow further, and you're going to continue to see us invest in that area. Right. So at the outset of my prepared remarks, I talked about the puts and takes on inflation, on the prices. The bottom line there is that for now, the consumer is supported, and that's pretty much irrelevant of income cohort, is supported by a strong labor market. So that's fundamentally true, and it's fundamentally true around the world. But it's in aggregate, but it's not a uniform answer. The picture obviously plays out very differently country-by-country. We have a very global business. So we look at what is the Central Bank of Japan doing and we saw that today. They raised rates. And then Europe, you see Germany came through with actually a small recession in the past quarter. So there's a lot of back and forth. But that fundamental point that the consumer is supported by a strong labor market and some wage growth. I think that's true, and we don't expect any dramatic changes on that front, and that's why we remain positive about the outlook. You peel the onion a bit further, you look into different cohorts. And it's pretty clear that when it comes to higher income versus lower income, if you spend on an expensive trip or an experiences during the summer, whatever you're trying to do, you have more income, then you can do more of that and you have less income and you can do less of that. What we generally see though as a function of the digital economy. The higher-end consumer, but certainly the mid-income and lower-income consumer is much more empowered, empowered by having more data and the ability to look for a better deal. And that's what everybody is trying to do to make things add up and work for them that they still want to do that trip. So all of that together overall adds up to a picture that we feel pretty good, at least about our side of the business. And why do I say that? Because inflation and prices cut across carded and non-carded. But we are obviously particularly positioned. So you saw that rise. And right now, you see a lot of inflation in auto insurance and rent. That's not necessarily so much carded. So these are all the things that we think through comes back down to the fundamental point in aggregate, we see healthy consumer spending and don't see that changing in the short term. All right. Thanks, Devin. So everybody past, we talked about the momentum and a good quarter. all of this obviously only happens because it takes the hard work of our colleagues at Mastercard, I thank them, and I also want to thank you for your support for Mastercard. We're looking forward to speak to you in a quarter from now and hopefully see some of you at our Investor Day Community Meeting on November 13 in New York. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Inc. Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n Mr. Devin Corr, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. \nDevin Corr: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments for Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce you opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. There is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. \n Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach. \nMichael Miebach: Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Our momentum continued this quarter as we once again delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter 1 net revenues were up 11% and adjusted net income up 16% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were powered by healthy consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth of 18% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We had new deal wins in every region, and we're driving growth by scaling our innovative technologies. That's why people choose Mastercard, a simple, seamless and secure way to pay. With these strong results, we are reiterating our full year 2024 outlook for both net revenue and operating expense on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. On the macroeconomic front, the picture remains mixed. First, strong labor markets and solid wage growth remain in countries across the globe. This is supportive of healthy consumer spending. Second, inflation has been moderating with a path towards normalization of monetary policy in most countries. Persistent inflation in the United States could delay rate cuts here. And third, geopolitical uncertainty remains in several countries. In addition to these areas, we are closely monitoring the strength of the dollar, commodity prices and consumer balance sheet health. With tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain on balance, we are positive about the growth outlook. With this backdrop, we are focused on our strategic priorities: consumer payments, new flows and services and new networks. The recent realignment of our organizational structure will help our teams to execute on these priorities faster to deliver more value to our partners and customers. \n In payments, our growth algorithm consists of being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments, further penetrating new flows, growing market share and optimizing our customer portfolios. I will address a few of those. Starting with the shift to digital for person to merchant payments, this secular opportunity has been a very important component of our growth algorithm across both volume and transactions. We are confident this will continue over the long term. Our acceptance footprint is a key competitive advantage, and we continue to expand our reach globally while enhancing the user experience for digital transactions through our technologies. Our fast and secure Contactless technology has been instrumental in displacing cash. Contactless now represents more than 2 of every 3 in-person [ switch ] purchase transactions, up from 1 in 3 prior to the pandemic. And our Tap on Phone capabilities are simply a cost-effective way for merchants of all sizes to accept digital card payments. We're now live in over 100 markets. In Brazil alone, the number of active devices is now over 1.5 million. And Apple continues to expand Tap to Pay on iPhone in markets like Brazil, where recently the solution was rolled out by fintechs, Stone, [ NuBank ], SumUp and Cloud Walk. As payments become more digital, there is an increasing demand from consumers and merchants for a simpler and more secure payment experience. Whether online or through a wallet provider, our tokens, deliver an elevated level of security and payment credentials are shared between the bank and the merchant. This improves the performance of a client's portfolio while supporting new ways to pay. This key differentiator creates a flywheel effect. Lower fraud, higher approval rates and a better consumer experience bring more transactions and volume to the MasterCard network, which in turn drives more payments revenue and brings more data. Tokens also create a streamlined way to accelerate the monetization of associated services to our customers. \n In quarter 1, tokenized transactions grew over 50% year-over-year with more room to go as only approximately 1 in 4 transactions on the MasterCard network are tokenized today. Further opportunity lies in the verticals traditionally underpenetrated by Card. Merchants are embracing solutions to simplify checkout, reduce missed payments and drive engagement. We are focused on segments such as housing and health care that have sizable spend and where our solutions can address the needs of providers and consumers. Rent payments is one vertical where we are working with aggregators to enable digital payments. \n In health care, we're partnering with several providers to grow acceptance in key markets like Germany. And we are playing in the gaming community or puns intended, with partners like global video game commerce company, Xsolla to improve the payment experience. The opportunity to bring more transactions onto the Mastercard network remains. We now switch approximately 2/3 of our total transactions worldwide, up from approximately 55% in 2018. Our actions in markets where switching penetration was historically low like Japan, Mexico, Colombia and Chile have increased this penetration, and we will continue to focus on this. My takeaway for you is the secular opportunity is large and it's lasting, and we are well positioned to go after it. Our momentum also continues with issuers and co-brand partners as we are winning new deals and retaining key business in every region. \n Starting in the Americas. In the fi quarter, we further solidified our position in Brazil. signing an agreement with Banco Bradesco, one of the largest banks in the market across credit, commercial and services. We're making great progress in converting the previously announced debit wins in the United States. The Fiserv Money Network card program for the California Employment Development Department has now gone live with Mastercard. On the conversions of Citizens and Webster, we are well underway. We're further strengthening our leadership position with retail co-brands in the U.S., Mastercard will be the exclusive network for the Citi issued Dillard's co-brand. We have also extended our long-standing partnerships with Target and the TJX companies. In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, we signed a 10-year exclusive partnership with First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest bank in the UAE. The agreement spans consumer and commercial issuance across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt. We entered into a new exclusive co-brand agreement across the EMEA region with Global Hotel Alliance, the world's largest alliance of independent hotel brands. And in India, we signed a 10-year consumer credit issuance deal with Axis Bank.  And finally, in Europe, we extended our long-standing partnership with [indiscernible]. The deal renews our payments relationship with one of the largest banks in the region while continuing to embed comprehensive marketing, consulting and loyalty solutions. These examples, like many others, are true partnerships. Our teams are invested in making them a win-win experience, and we will continue to use our innovative product capabilities and differentiated service offerings and our solution selling approach [ produce ] positive results for our customers and for Mastercard. Now you asked before, why are we winning? That's exactly why we're winning.  \n Moving next to the new flows pillar of our growth algorithm. We continue to execute against our strategy to further penetrate the addressable market in targeted areas like commercial payments, and disbursements and remittances. Growth in commercial is about making sure we are connected to the right partners and have the right solutions to power growth. made great strides in securing key partnerships, including traditional banks, travel and ERP providers. We previously announced our expanded agreement with Wells Fargo in the U.S. As part of our small business relationship, I'm happy to share that we've made significant progress in the conversion of this card portfolio to the Mastercard network. Also this quarter, we won our first commercial credit issue deal with SBI Card in India. In commercial solutions [ we're ] components of the Banco Bradesco and First Abu Dhabi Bank deals I mentioned earlier.  \n In addition to aligning with the right partners, it's also about having the right solutions to help commercial clients address their needs, like consumers, they want an easy and secure payment experience. Our new innovative mobile virtual card app enables commercial cards to be seamlessly added to digital wallets as we do as a consumer, but businesses can easily enable employees to pay for expenses with a click and a smile. At the same time, they can optimize back-office processes with robust spend controls, enhanced reconciliation data. HSBC Australia and Westpac will be the first financial institutions to offer this solution. The same principle applies to the open-loop commercial fleet space, where we are the market leader. Our differentiated capabilities have positioned us as a preferred partner with the market-leading fleet providers such as Corepay. And fleet fintech AtoB has announced they will now convert their commercial credit card program exclusively to the Mastercard network.  \n And sticking to new flows, disbursement and remittances, we continue to extend our reach to new markets. In quarter 1, we grew transactions by over 40%, [ in combined ], our portfolio of domestic and international money movement capabilities into 1 offering, Mastercard Move. It includes our Mastercard Send and cross-border services and reaches nearly 10 billion endpoints worldwide. This quarter, we extended our reach further in China with our connection to Alipay, in the U.S., we're partnering with Verituity to create a white label solution for banks to modernize their disbursements and remittances through a plug-and-play solution. And we will work with Sweden based Pagero to support account-based cross-border and domestic payments.  \n Now shifting from payments to services and new networks, another important component of our growth algorithm. It starts with a powerful set of diversified solutions with best-in-class fraud capabilities, data analytics, consulting, marketing, loyalty, identity and open banking assets. These carefully curated assets help us grow and diversify our revenues and differentiate our payments. We drive growth in services and new networks across several vectors. First, remember, a portion of our services revenue is driven by payments. and these metrics continue to perform well. In addition, we're driving growth by increasing the penetration of existing customers. We're extending our services across new customers and new payment flows and we build and deploy new solutions.  \n Here are a few examples of how we're executing against these. Starting with increasing penetration with existing customers, success in delivering our services, strengthen relationships and can generate opportunities for future service engagements. Our best-in-class conversion support is often an entry point. A great example is with Westpac in Australia and New Zealand, where we expanded our service offerings to include digital strategy, marketing solutions, innovation sprints and portfolio optimization campaigns. We have a diverse set of solutions to also help banks manage critical business needs outside of payments, take credit risk, for example, core to all banks. Our consultants are working with Ford Brazil to improve their credit policies and management.  \n In a Saudi National Bank, we are enabling new credit risk modeling and scoring capabilities. There's still room to further penetrate services. Our top 50 services customers on average are using 2 to 3x more services than the balance of our issuing and acquiring customer base. We're also driving growth by extending our reach across multiple rails and networks outside of the Mastercard network. Mastercard Access provides customers with a single trusted connection to quickly and easily source a suite of services and we are seeing great traction. For example, Saudi National Bank will leverage Access to deploy a set of scheme-agnostic services across their portfolio. We also continue to innovate and develop new services and solutions. This helps us to meet the evolving needs of our clients while growing our addressable target market. Here's an example. Think about how people are shifting to streaming and other digital services. As they do, they're looking for 1 simple view of all their subscriptions. I think we've all been there. It's why we developed smart subscriptions. It's an open banking powered solution that puts a simple dashboard of all subscriptions regardless of network right into their consumer banking application. Cybercrime is a growing concern, last year alone, people in the United States lost over $12 billion to Internet scams. Scam Protect builds on the cybersecurity protections we have delivered for years, combines our identity biometric AI and open banking capabilities to identify and prevent scans before they occur. As part of this, we're partnering with organizations around the world, including Verizon, to collaborate on new solutions to protect consumers. By combining Mastercard's Identity Insights with Verizon's robust network technologies, new AI power tools will be designed to more accurately identify and block scammers. We continue to enhance our solutions with generative AI to deliver even more value, a world-leading real-time fraud solution, Decision Intelligence, has been helping banks score and safely approve billions of transactions, ensuring the safety of consumers and the entire payments networks for years. The next-generation technology, Decision Intelligence Pro is supercharged by generative AI to improve the overall score and boost fraud detection rates on average by 20%. So overall, there's a strong demand for our services and new networks across a diverse customer base. They continue to grow faster than the core, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead. With that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We are successfully executing against our strategy in realizing our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, our diversified business model and our focused strategy poses well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you. \nSachin Mehra: Well, thank you, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. In line with our outlook, net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 12%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 16% and 19%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as [ the ] lower tax rate, primarily due to a change in geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. EPS was $3.31, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2 billion worth of stock and an additional $815 million through April 26, 2024.  \n Let's turn to Page 4, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the first quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDP increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 6%. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 13% with credit growth of 12% and debit growth of 13%. The Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.  \n Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 13% year-over-year in Q1. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as Contactless now represents approximately 67% of all in-person, Switched to Purchase Transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  \n Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the first quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-Added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 15% despite tougher comps in Q1 2023. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our underlying drivers and continued demand for our Consulting and Marketing Services, Loyalty Solutions and Fraud and Security capabilities. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions.  \n Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic Assessments were up 10%, while Worldwide GDV also grew 10%. Cross-border Assessments increased 22%, while Cross-Border volumes increased 18%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix and pricing. Transaction Processing Assessments were up 12%, while Switched Transactions grew 13%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year, partially offset by favorable mix. Other Network Assessments were $226 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period.  \n Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend.  \n Turning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the first quarter and through the first 4 weeks of April. As a reminder, our Q1 Switched metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over 1 ppt of growth across each of Switched volumes, Switched Transactions and Cross-Border volumes. In addition, our Switched metrics in Q1 and in the first 4 weeks of April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After removing the impact of those 2 items, our operating metric trends were generally stable for the quarter as well as when looking at the first 4 weeks of April. A few items to note. U.S. Switched volume and transaction growth benefited from the commencement of the conversion of the Citizens debit portfolio to Mastercard. Outside of the U.S., growth was negatively impacted primarily by the lapping of the conversion of the NatWest debit portfolio to Mastercard. Cross-border card-not-present, ex travel continues to show strength and cross-border travel growth was impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel, particularly in Asia Pacific, which opened up later from COVID restrictions than the rest of the world.  \n  Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. Our business fundamentals remain strong and our diversified business model and momentum with customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. This is all underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand across our value-added services and solutions offerings. As Michael said, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we stand ready to manage investment levels as appropriate, while maintaining focus on the execution of our strategy. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. As it relates to the full year 2024, our thoughts for net revenue and operating expenses remain unchanged on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects continued healthy consumer spending and higher value-added services and solutions growth in all quarters for the balance of the year as compared to Q1. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. And foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily driven by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar. \n In terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year, while we expect a 0 to 1 ppt benefit from foreign exchange. \n Now turning to Q2 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while we expect an approximately 2 ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. \n Other items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses in Q2, we expect an expense of approximately $85 million. This expense is higher than what we had in Q1, driven by lower forecasted net average cash balances in Q2, primarily due to higher working capital requirements as well as the geographic mix of cash. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% for both Q2 and on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. \nDevin Corr: Thank you. [ Audra ], you may open up the line for Q&A now. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Yes. Sachin, just a question on the guide. I mean, it seems like a lot of the guide lower on revenues is just FX, but I'm just confirming when we look at the volume and yield trends, those seem to be doing fairly well, if not slightly better than expectations. And you mentioned the conversion beginning, just trying to think through as we look ahead, it seems like those trends seem constructive. I just want to make sure that's the way you're looking at it. \nSachin Mehra: Sanjay, I think you said it exactly right. First of all, just to be very clear, like I said, our guide for the full year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, is unchanged relative to what we shared at the last earnings call. what we're seeing, generally speaking, is healthy consumer spending. These trends are very much in line with what we expected when we put the guide out in the first place. So nothing unusual to report from an overall spending trend standpoint. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has appreciated quarter-over-quarter. And what you're seeing is really our best reflection of what we think the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar is going to be on our as reported numbers, which is what we shared with you. That's the only real update. Our guide otherwise is very much unchanged. And as it relates to your question on conversions, the conversions which are taking place are very much things which we had contemplated in our original guide. So that's very much part and parcel of what we had contemplated. So business as usual, I want to be very clear, there's nothing which has really changed from a guide standpoint, when you look at it on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. \nOperator: We'll move next to Craig Maurer at FT Partners. \nCraig Maurer: Two questions. First, it looks in the April trends as if the most material slowdown was intra-Europe cross-border. Could you just confirm if that's the case and if that was really predominantly Easter like you suggested. Secondly, we should be coming up on the 6-month anniversary of your announcement of Chinese domestic market approval. When should we expect the first transaction to be processed? And have you been able to work out whether you'll be able to use existing issued cards in the domestic market after a workaround on the EMV code or will you have to reissue? \nSachin Mehra: Craig, I'll take the first question. Your observation on intra-Europe is exactly right. What you're seeing in the first 4 weeks of April is exactly what you said. It's related to the timing of Easter. Easter has actually a more pronounced impact in intra-Europe and that's why you're seeing a more exaggerated number out there. And then on your second question, as it relates to China, Michael is going to just take that right now. \nMichael Miebach: So on China, we got the license in November, and we shared our excitement about that. So the excitement continues. The teams have been busy building out issuance relationships with our banking partners in China and building out the acceptance footprint. We're obviously not starting from 0 here. We had a strong cross-border business. So we have relationships in play that give us a heads up. There was a time line associated with the license, and we're expecting to go live with the first transactions to a very specific question here in the month of May. As far as using existing cards in China, I think the key question here behind that is -- how can you use existing acceptance in China and start to generate volume. And here, our approach is through the partnership with the digital wallets to have cards put into the digital wallet so they can be used at the whole wide range of merchants in China. So I do want to say we are excited. At the same time, it's clear we're going to start processing, [indiscernible] transactions domestically, this is a medium- to long-term opportunity. In the short term, there's more work that we need to do to build out more acceptance and continue to get more card programs out, but we feel very encouraged about that. Our teams are very busy with that activity. \nSachin Mehra: And Craig, I'll just add a couple of points as it relates to China. One, I think you might have seen in the press that the Chinese government is pushing hard to increase inbound cross-border travel by expanding acceptance of international cards. That's their way of making sure that they're encouraging tourism inbound into the country. And we're actively working on expanding our footprint there, just expanding on what Michael said. That's point number one, as it relates to how we're seeing the China play, play out. The second point I'll make on China is -- it's kind of interesting when you think about a MasterCard card issued in China going forward, that will probably be 1 of the few networks which is most widely accepted across the globe, just by virtue of the fact that those cards are now going to be accepted in China and they're already accepted across the globe, different from our competitors in many ways. So we like what we're doing in terms of pursuing our strategy down there. I just wanted to make sure I kind of brought those 2 points out as well. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Michael, how would you characterize or how do you think about the penetration rate of existing customers when it comes to value-added services. It's more important part of the growth algorithm, how do you measure -- how do you think about how mature the long-term opportunity is when it comes to cross-selling value-added services into your base? \nMichael Miebach: Ramsey, you are hitting on a really important point. value-added services, a key differentiator for our payment solutions, payment solutions. The link is pretty clear, more volume, more data, and I talked about the whole growth algorithm earlier on the call. Now this doesn't just naturally have to us. It requires really focused execution. To your point, we are all at any point in time, very clear what our cross-sell ratios are, what value we can offer to our customers and who we have it offered to and who we haven't offered it to. I give you a stat earlier that talked about that you have 2 to 3x more services with our top 50 customers. So there is tremendous potential in there. And our teams are very focused on that. Across the company, we have our existing relationship manager, sales force out there across the whole world, but we're also having a set of very specific more hunter-oriented sales forces that drive very specific new products with deep value that we drive into separate selling centers into these customers. So it's a pretty broad approach. At any point in time, we see that data, and we drive that because as you said, this is a near-term growth opportunity that we should leverage and we will. \nOperator: We'll go next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein. \nHarshita Rawat: Michael, can you talk about the U.S. merchant class action settlement. I know this still needs to be approved by the courts, but how should we think about the implications from the changes proposed on surcharging for specific brands? And how do you think you stay down? \nMichael Miebach: Right. Thanks, Harshita. So the first word, I would say, relief. This has been long standing, and we are happy that there was an agreement found with the merchant community as well as with Visa and this is behind us. So what this was about is the U.S. merchant rules class. So what was in focus here was the business rules that make up the Mastercard promise. And the conversation was around how can we provide opportunities to merchants to manage their cost of acceptance on 1 hand, at the same time, how do we keep the major promise to consumers of the Mastercard brand and that is, you can pay anywhere and you will not be discriminated against your payment. So that was the toggle over the years and an agreement was reached. And basically, what happens is we're going to have a mild reduction of interchange rates, number one. and we're providing more clarity and simplification around surcharging rules and discounting rules on the 1 hand. At the same time, we retain the promise of [ to ] honor all card rule out there. So that is what is out there. We don't expect any dramatic impact on the business from the interchange changes. And for merchants, they -- we will see what the choices they make on surcharging and on discounting. We've seen in the past that surcharging is not always clear to consumers. It's not always prepared, so we'll see what choices will come up. So broadly speaking, I don't expect a major impact on our business. In terms of financial impact, we have accounted for the legal fees associated with that. Otherwise, there is no impact directly on Mastercard. So all in, a very good outcome, and it proves 1 point. It proves the point that there is a lot of momentum and a lot of competition in the payments market and yet again another moving item and merchants agreed to this, and this is a good step forward for everybody. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev at Mizuho. \nDan Dolev: So rebates and incentives were a little bit higher than what we had expected in the first quarter. How should we think about the remainder of the year? And do we expect it to cool off a little bit? \nSachin Mehra: So on rebates and incentives, very much in line with what I kind of shared in terms of our thoughts at the last earnings call, very much in line with our expectations as how we ended up in the first quarter. As it relates -- and you know what the usual puts and takes are as it relates to what drives this incentive, so I won't kind of repeat that. But the reality is, we continue to be out in the market, working to win business. We've got a strong pipeline of deals. We'll continue to execute on that. You hear about them on every earnings call. As it relates to the second quarter, as we see it right now, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to slightly down from what we saw in the first quarter. So the reality is -- I want to kind of just make sure we put this in perspective, right? We do these rebates and incentives to bring more volume onto our network. When we bring more volume onto our network, it gives us the opportunity to optimize those portfolios to grow them at a faster pace, it helps us deliver more services, which helps us drive net revenue accretion from a yield standpoint. And so it's very much in line with our strategy, and that's what I've got in the nature of thoughts for the second quarter. \nMichael Miebach: Yes. It's a competitive marketplace. So we have to be competitive on the financial side. We clearly see the flywheel effect that Sachin just talked about between payments and services, more volume on, more ability to sell our services. But it's also clear that we are very, very focused on what deals we want to win. So we don't want to win every deal and we're very, very targeted here whatever meets our financial criteria and our strategic focus in certain markets and certain verticals. \nOperator: We'll go next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. \nDarrin Peller: Maybe we just hit on some specific travel trends. I mean, and really more broadly, consumer trends. If you could just give us a little more on what you're seeing from a travel dynamics standpoint. It did decel a bit into April. And I know Easter timing was a factor, but it seems like it could be a little more than that. So is there anything you're seeing behavior-wise that's impacting that? Do you expect that to rebound and then maybe just, Michael, if you can give us a sense of your view of where we are in the, the dynamic of conversion on to electronic payments for the consumer payment side. Any changes in patterns we're seeing in terms of the U.S. growth rate in particular and then more broadly. \nSachin Mehra: Sure. I'll take the first part of your question. As it relates to cross-border travel, really, what we are seeing is exactly what we said, which is the lower growth rate that you're seeing in the first 4 weeks of April, as we've seen and we've analyzed as being primarily driven by just the timing of Easter. There's nothing unusual to call out. The only thing I will say is when you think about cross-border travel, you should think about it in the context of also tougher comps, particularly as it relates to Asia because Asia was late to come out of the restrictions of COVID. So last year, you saw a strong recovery take place in terms of cross-border travel in Asia and then it just creates [ for ] tougher comps this year. But fundamentally, the value prop is very sound. We've got great portfolios, we continue to win portfolios which are travel leaning, cross-border travel leaning, and we're executing on this portfolio. So nothing unusual that I'm seeing, travel growth rates are very healthy, and they're actually, I would say, are running at a cliff, which is -- when I go back to the pre COVID days, it actually is running at a cliff, which is pretty comparable to what we used to see in the pre COVID days when adjusted for the timing of Easter and the comp impact. \nMichael Miebach: Right, just a last comment on travel and tourism in general. Sachin earlier mentioned that the Chinese government is really focused on driving inbound tourism. I just came back from a series of trips Indonesia, 1 of them, and you see yet another government that is driving inbound tourism. We see it in India. We see it in Spain and so forth. In order to work with governments and how to actually do that. There's a whole practice around our public sector business to build out, use the data that we have to create not -- in order to aid the portfolios that we have, create approaches with governments to promote their respective destinations. And all this comes hand-in-hand to a much more holistic approach that we're now seeing around travel vis-a-vis competitors out there. So that was 1 thing I wanted to add. \n On the conversion piece and the shift to digital payments, you asked specifically about the United States. I want to hang it up a little bit broader. Starting off with -- there is a tremendous secular opportunity from a geographic perspective. So there is opportunity left here in the United States, but if you look around the world and you see some other countries, G7 economies like Italy, you have 45% cash. So tremendous opportunity even in developed opportunities to -- developed companies to go after that. I just mentioned Indonesia. In Indonesia, you have over 70% cash. So this is a country where the President has put out by 2045. They're going to be the fourth largest economy in the world, 280 million people. So there's the whole range across developed and developing economies for us to continue to go and push into. \n You heard us talk about changing behaviors post-COVID. People are ordering more takeout foods and doing more things generally online, and that is generally a preferential place for card transactions. So going into these verticals is important. We gave you the example on a number of occasions of takeout food. That's 1 transaction in the restaurants, but multiple transactions as you pay your platform, the platform pays the restaurant and so forth. But think about public transport is another example. Here, we're talking real scale around the globe. So that is multiple transactions as consumers get into open-loop systems multiple times a day. And when they get out of the station, they use that same tapping behavior as they buy a coffee and so forth. So there's tremendous transaction opportunity driven by change in behaviors of consumers. And there's whole new sectors, as I mentioned about in the prepared remarks, health care, rent and so forth. So the secular opportunity, this was not just a throwaway comment earlier when I say it's big and it's lasting. It goes up exactly in those layers, and we are very focused on each and every 1 of those layers. So this is around for a while. \nOperator: We'll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Just wanted to ask on value-added services. The the outlook here. Can you just elaborate on the visibility for a faster growth beyond the first quarter? I know comps are -- is a big part of it. Just curious about visibility beyond the comps. And then is there potential to catalyze growth in the other category within value-added services? \nSachin Mehra: Sure. Tien-Tsin, I'll take that. So like I mentioned, right, I mean, first of all, our overall outlook and the demand we're seeing for our value-added services and solutions continues to be quite compelling and strong. I mean we're out there actively, as Michael mentioned earlier, driving and pushing harder across the various sectors, which we kind of talked about. So I won't repeat them. As it relates to the thoughts I shared as it relates to growth rates for value-added services and solutions for the remaining quarters of the year, which I said that the growth rates would be higher in each of the quarters compared to Q1. It's really based on what we're seeing in the nature of the pipeline, how we're seeing things shape up in terms of the cadence of how we're going to deliver on these value-added services and solutions, we feel pretty good about the outlook there, which is why we're sharing with you what we're thinking about in the nature of this higher growth relative to Q1 in each of the quarters. \n The only other comment I'll make is it's a little bit of a reminder out here, which is, as we deliver on these value-added services and solutions, we're obviously generating revenue from the value-added services and solutions but that's also driving very compelling kind of cases for us to accelerate our payments growth, right? So that's part and parcel of the strategy. It's all kind of very independent, one or the other. On your other question, which was around other solutions growth, look, we continue to remain focused on growing the other solutions. It's primarily comprised of our real-time infrastructure assets as in our bill payment assets. \n That inherently is slightly slower growth compared to what we've got in our safety and security solutions, our consulting and marketing, loyalty solutions, so we'll continue to drive on that. I don't necessarily expect that the growth rates there are going to get comparable to what we see on the safety and security side as well as in the consulting and marketing and loyalty solutions side, primarily because the opportunity which is there on Safety and Security and Consulting is a much larger TAM and it's a faster-growing TAM, and we're continuing to execute on it. The good news is -- the safety and security fees as well as the consulting and marketing and data analytics and insights component is the lion's share of what comprises our value-added services and solutions. \nMichael Miebach: [indiscernible] back to the piece, Tien-Tsin, as we discussed earlier about existing customers and the cross-sell. So that's an opportunity. We laid out the drive into new customer segments. So that's pretty clear. In here, give you an example, on the personalization thing, our Dynamic Yield acquisitions dating back to [ 2020 ], you have a lot of high-end retail and commerce brands that I want to engage on that. Everybody is trying to cut through the clutter, take Saks Fifth Avenue, they're using our personalization services. So those are all opportunities to get into certain verticals that we're not even in today in a significant way. So that is what gives us great confidence, there's great demand as we look ahead into services, and that's why we're saying they're going to be higher than the first quarter. \nOperator: We'll move next to David Togut at Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Are you seeing any change in competitive intensity in Europe, primarily for your payment network. Your primary competitor called out share gains local payment networks in the quarter that has long been a source of growth for Mastercard. So either changing competitive intensity from the principal competitor in Europe and/or any initiatives by local payment schemes to become more competitive themselves? \nMichael Miebach: David, Europe's a fantastic growth story for Mastercard, starting off with some of the big shifts in debit in the U.K., some great wins on the continent. Earlier, I was talking about the renewal of [indiscernible], some big deals that are still in flight on conversion if you think about UniCredit, 13 markets across the continent. So we're well positioned here. Obviously, Europe is in focus from a set of competitors that is local players as in local schemes and so forth, but we've long found a way to partner with them. we feel they have a great proposition on credit and debit to compete. At the same time, there are services partnerships that we drive across and then more traditional competitors, of course, we're all eyeing Europe. Europe is too much of a growth story overall for everybody to keep competing. But we, as I said earlier, we try to turn these relationships into win-win partnerships. UniCredit in the end decided to go with us because they feel we have shown better traction in serving their customer needs. So it comes down to that, and I feel pretty confident as I look across Europe. And it continues to be a growth opportunity. Back to this question about secular opportunity. Europe still has a lot to offer on that front, and we have a whole set of solutions to go after that. \nSachin Mehra: Just 1 more point I'll add, David, as it relates -- we've had this long-standing focus on conversion of Maestro to Debit Mastercard, and that's very much the case in Europe as well that we continue to execute on that. I feel like that's going to be one of those things which will continue to provide us a natural tailwind as we continue to execute on that capability. For example, in this quarter, we migrated or converted very roughly 7 million consumers from Maestro to debit Mastercard. And that's a global number. That's not just a Europe number, but I just want to share that with you as another piece of how we're executing in Europe. \nOperator: We'll move next to James Faucette at Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: I'm wondering, you talked about strong cross-border and travel trends, et cetera. We've seen some more indications of uneven consumer spending development in other parts of the economy generally. I'm wondering if you can call out whether it be in the U.S. or in other markets, if there's anything discernible at your level in terms of consumer shifting, spending preferences or categories that are noteworthy. And if we should take in if there's anything that could impact Mastercard or other indications that we should be aware of? \nMichael Miebach: All right. Let me start off on this and then Sachin can comment further. So you've seen the 18% growth, so this is strong. So there's a travel component to that, and there is an ex travel component to that. Ex travel continues to be particularly strong, it's cross-border e-commerce and the [ likes ]. On the travel side, if you break that down, we talked about the trends. I want to lift it up a little bit to the broader -- I think the broader angle of your question. So what are the various things that consumers think about as they make spending decisions, how did it make ends meet and travel has been strong ever since COVID, particularly strong from a recovery perspective and has been strong even for COVID because the seeking of experience is just a fundamental trend that hasn't gone away. \n So it's not one of those circular things. This is just a secular trend that we see. People are seeking services and experiences and travel is the top of the list. Now as you go and break this down into different countries, you're going to see different stages of inflation. You're going to see different monetary policy and fiscal policy, how governments and regulators are reacting to inflation and so forth. And that affects consumers in different ways. If you see inflation in non-carded verticals, that's going to impact your payment decisions or your spending decisions on carded verticals and so forth. So it's a pretty not uniform story around the world. that's why I come back to the fundamental trend. Travel is winning. People want to go out and make that trip. And hence, we remain pretty optimistic around that. \nSachin Mehra: As it relates to while we're on the topic of cross-border travel, I just wanted to kind of share where we are in terms of where we see potential for some recovery, which is particularly in Asia Pacific, which has got still some room to grow. [ Case in point ] would be China, where we've shared these metrics with you in the past, but I'll share with you what the Q1 metric was inbound and outbound of China. So in Q1, cross-border travel, inbound and outbound into and from China stood at approximately 80% of the pre-COVID level. So there's still room to recover. And granted China is going through a little bit of a slower period in terms of how the domestic economy is performing. But the reality is there still remains an opportunity over the medium to long term to see how this recovery comes through in the nature of travel even from that corridor, per se. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Chiodo at UBS. \nTimothy Chiodo: I want to talk a little bit about U.S. debit trends. So you mentioned the Citizens Bank beginning -- portfolio beginning to come through. But also on Reg II, more specifically, we've talked about it in the past as a small portion of your overall net revenue in terms of U.S. online debit. And often, we talk about the risk or the threat to that small portion. But could you also talk about the flip side to that, so the opportunity for Mastercard to gain the position on the back of the card for some of the Visa debit cards in the U.S. \nMichael Miebach: Right, so Tim, great point. We love to talk about debit. You saw the 6% growth rate. So this is good. We're doing well, and the impact of the conversions is felt. As far as it comes to routing and Reg II, this question comes up for now for a couple of calls. And I have to say where we are, we're seeing some impact, but it's not material. That comes to the bigger question that you raised, how do we look at that? So it's not material, that's great. That gives us even more reason to look at the opportunity side of this and you're fighting for back of card. And in the end, it comes down to the routing mandates, such as just distorting the market. I think what's happening here is it's ignoring the fact that in the end, a merchant will make a decision on the basis of a net economic outcome. And the net economic outcome is not just the cost of operating related to some routing costs but it is fraud costs, et cetera, the whole package altogether. And this is, I think, where we score well because we have a better proposition. Last 5 years, we've invested $7 billion into Safety and Security Solutions and that makes a competitive advantage for us. So -- and that makes for a competitive advantage for us. So I see the opportunity, our teams are out. They're talking to merchants that saying, \"Here's what the net proposition is if you choice A versus choice B. And so far, that is an encouraging set of dialogues. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin at TD Cowen. \nBryan Bergin: I wanted to just ask about the change in the organizational structure. Any financial implications to be [ aware ] from that? Just how you're feeling about those early changes as you pursue the growth opportunities across the business. \nMichael Miebach: Right. So what we're doing here is you heard us talk about the growth algorithm, about our strategic priorities. In the end, what's happening here is we're realigning our portfolio of activities, always recognizing these are all interdependent. We're talking payments and services and altogether, it makes our competitive advantage position. But we basically say, we want to focus on core payments. We want to focus on new payment flows, and we want to focus on an integrated services set of offerings. And that is what is part of this announcement, plus we see tremendous opportunity on the AI side, particularly on the generative AI side, and we've created a central role for that. So these are 4 very seasoned leaders in the company that have tremendous experience around these topics. They're going to take this on and the whole idea is to move faster and drive more value to our customers. In terms of financial impact, what I hope to see is we kind of deliver the growth that we think is out there in terms of potential. That is the impact that I'm looking for. So that's really the play. There's nothing else to say beyond that. I'm looking -- talking to Craig, who's going to lead the services [ saying ], what is going to be on our product road map going forward? How do we drive even more services growth, et cetera. So that's the whole play. It's bringing structure strategy in line and move forward. \nOperator: Next, we'll move to Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Keane: Just want to ask about the continued positive yields you're getting in cross-border, your major peer isn't seeing the same kind of positive yield and they talk about low currency volatility as part of the reason. So I think you mentioned Sachin pricing and mix and just helping us understand how much is sustainable of those changes for yield in cross-border and the differences maybe between your closest peer. \nSachin Mehra: Sure. So first, I just want to quickly remind you that as it relates to the impact of FX volatility in our instance, that shows up in our transaction processing assessments. It doesn't show up in our cross-border assessment. So the impact of the, what I would say, the drag associated with FX volatility shows up in this transaction processing assessment line. It doesn't show up in our cross-border assessment line, point number one. Point number two, you're right about the yields. Our portfolios continue to perform well. It goes back to what Michael said earlier, we want to win not only every portfolio, but we want to win the right portfolios. And that's what we focused on doing over the last few years, which is winning the right portfolios for cross-border and what that's helped us do is see this favorable mix come through where we are seeing the inter cross-border grow at a more rapid pace than the intra-Europe cross-border. \n And you do know that the yields on the inter cross-border side are higher than the yields on intra cross-border, intra-Europe cross-border. So that certainly helps from a yield standpoint. And then as it relates to your question on pricing, look, we've always kind of done pricing for the value we deliver when we deliver value to our customers, whether it's on the issuing side of the acquiring side, we price for it. I called out that in this quarter, we had a little bit of a lift come through on pricing in the cross-border assessments line. And you'll see that come through the ensuing quarters as the year progresses as well. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Koning at Baird. \nDavid Koning: Nice job. I guess advertising is my question. It was the lowest in a long time by quite a bit, too. And I'm wondering if there's some correlation between how much you have to advertise and even rebates that if you're giving back some in dollars to your clients, you don't have to advertise quite as much. Is there a correlation there? And maybe just why is it down so much? \nSachin Mehra: Yes. Look, I mean, the A&M spend is typically -- it's a cadence of how we see the promotions we want to do. So let me just step back and kind of think a little bit about why we spend on A&M. You could do it at the brand level, but you could do it towards activation of sponsorships. And depending on when your sponsorship assets are in play is when you want to do the activation around those sponsorship assets. So that influences the cadence of spend on A&M. So you're right, we had lower A&M in the first quarter. I kind of mentioned in my prepared remarks about how it's the timing of A&M. What I was basically alluding to is that as the year progresses, we will be spending more on the advertising and marketing line. \n On the second part of your question as to the toggling factor between the expense line and what we might be giving in terms of marketing or marketing spend in terms of [ contract ]. There is an element of marketing, which we do give in terms of rebates and incentives to drive portfolio spend. We work very closely with our issuing partners on that. And so it's across both of those that we are looking to actually optimize from a marketing standpoint. \nMichael Miebach: Right. The last comment I want to make on this. So we are a very large fintech, but we're not just a fintech. We have a massive consumer brand. It's a fast-moving brand. It's amongst the top 10 brands on Brand Z, so investing in marketing is absolutely critical. This is not a trade-off that we make to -- from quarter-over-quarter, it fluctuates at exactly the way that Sachin just talked about, when is the Champions League on? When is this on this on, when is that on, and we have a very carefully curated set of sponsorship assets and it drive a bit of the timing. But we love our brand, we invest in it. I think for the fifth year in a row, we have been the #1 Sonic brand in the world. So there's a lot going on, on the marketing side that we are very proud about. And I think that brings us to the end. What a great question to end the call on. Thank you so much. It is Labor Day in most parts of the world today. So when I thank our colleagues yet again, which I do in every call, on Labor Day, it makes even more sense. SO a big call out to the 33,000 at Mastercard, and thank you to you and our shareholders for your continued support. Thank you very much. Speak to you next quarter. Bye-bye. \nSachin Mehra: Thank you. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sachin Mehra",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Michael. Turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. In line with our outlook, net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 12%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 16% and 19%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as [ the ] lower tax rate, primarily due to a change in geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. EPS was $3.31, which includes a $0.07 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2 billion worth of stock and an additional $815 million through April 26, 2024.  \n Let's turn to Page 4, where I'll speak to the growth rates of some of our key drivers for the first quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., GDP increased by 6% with credit growth of 6% and debit growth of 6%. Outside of the U.S. volume increased 13% with credit growth of 12% and debit growth of 13%. The Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.  \n Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 13% year-over-year in Q1. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as Contactless now represents approximately 67% of all in-person, Switched to Purchase Transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  \n Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the first quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-Added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 15% despite tougher comps in Q1 2023. This growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our underlying drivers and continued demand for our Consulting and Marketing Services, Loyalty Solutions and Fraud and Security capabilities. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions.  \n Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network. Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic Assessments were up 10%, while Worldwide GDV also grew 10%. Cross-border Assessments increased 22%, while Cross-Border volumes increased 18%. The 4 ppt difference is primarily driven by favorable mix and pricing. Transaction Processing Assessments were up 12%, while Switched Transactions grew 13%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year, partially offset by favorable mix. Other Network Assessments were $226 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period.  \n Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. The growth in operating expenses was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as well as an increase in indirect taxes as discussed on our Q4 earnings call. This was partially offset by the timing of advertising and marketing spend.  \n Turning to Page 9, let me comment on the operating metric trends in the first quarter and through the first 4 weeks of April. As a reminder, our Q1 Switched metrics include the impact of the leap year in 2024, which added just over 1 ppt of growth across each of Switched volumes, Switched Transactions and Cross-Border volumes. In addition, our Switched metrics in Q1 and in the first 4 weeks of April were impacted by the timing of Easter, which occurred at the end of Q1 this year as compared to in April in 2023. After removing the impact of those 2 items, our operating metric trends were generally stable for the quarter as well as when looking at the first 4 weeks of April. A few items to note. U.S. Switched volume and transaction growth benefited from the commencement of the conversion of the Citizens debit portfolio to Mastercard. Outside of the U.S., growth was negatively impacted primarily by the lapping of the conversion of the NatWest debit portfolio to Mastercard. Cross-border card-not-present, ex travel continues to show strength and cross-border travel growth was impacted by tougher comps as we continue to lap the recovery of travel, particularly in Asia Pacific, which opened up later from COVID restrictions than the rest of the world.  \n  Turning to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. Our business fundamentals remain strong and our diversified business model and momentum with customers position us well for the opportunities ahead. This is all underpinned by healthy consumer spending, the secular shift to digital forms of payment and strong demand across our value-added services and solutions offerings. As Michael said, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we are monitoring, and we stand ready to manage investment levels as appropriate, while maintaining focus on the execution of our strategy. Overall, we remain positive about the growth outlook. As it relates to the full year 2024, our thoughts for net revenue and operating expenses remain unchanged on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We expect net revenue to grow at the high end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. This reflects continued healthy consumer spending and higher value-added services and solutions growth in all quarters for the balance of the year as compared to Q1. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. And foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of 1 to 2 ppt for the year, primarily driven by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar. \n In terms of operating expenses, our expectations for the full year are to grow at the low end of a low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year, while we expect a 0 to 1 ppt benefit from foreign exchange. \n Now turning to Q2 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low double-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while we expect an approximately 2 ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q2 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a low double-digit range versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. \n Other items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses in Q2, we expect an expense of approximately $85 million. This expense is higher than what we had in Q1, driven by lower forecasted net average cash balances in Q2, primarily due to higher working capital requirements as well as the geographic mix of cash. This assumes the prevailing interest rates and debt levels continue and excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% for both Q2 and on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin. Sanjay, I think you said it exactly right. First of all, just to be very clear, like I said, our guide for the full year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, is unchanged relative to what we shared at the last earnings call. what we're seeing, generally speaking, is healthy consumer spending. These trends are very much in line with what we expected when we put the guide out in the first place. So nothing unusual to report from an overall spending trend standpoint. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has appreciated quarter-over-quarter. And what you're seeing is really our best reflection of what we think the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar is going to be on our as reported numbers, which is what we shared with you. That's the only real update. Our guide otherwise is very much unchanged. And as it relates to your question on conversions, the conversions which are taking place are very much things which we had contemplated in our original guide. So that's very much part and parcel of what we had contemplated. So business as usual, I want to be very clear, there's nothing which has really changed from a guide standpoint, when you look at it on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Craig, I'll take the first question. Your observation on intra-Europe is exactly right. What you're seeing in the first 4 weeks of April is exactly what you said. It's related to the timing of Easter. Easter has actually a more pronounced impact in intra-Europe and that's why you're seeing a more exaggerated number out there. And then on your second question, as it relates to China, Michael is going to just take that right now. And Craig, I'll just add a couple of points as it relates to China. One, I think you might have seen in the press that the Chinese government is pushing hard to increase inbound cross-border travel by expanding acceptance of international cards. That's their way of making sure that they're encouraging tourism inbound into the country. And we're actively working on expanding our footprint there, just expanding on what Michael said. That's point number one, as it relates to how we're seeing the China play, play out. The second point I'll make on China is -- it's kind of interesting when you think about a MasterCard card issued in China going forward, that will probably be 1 of the few networks which is most widely accepted across the globe, just by virtue of the fact that those cards are now going to be accepted in China and they're already accepted across the globe, different from our competitors in many ways. So we like what we're doing in terms of pursuing our strategy down there. I just wanted to make sure I kind of brought those 2 points out as well. So on rebates and incentives, very much in line with what I kind of shared in terms of our thoughts at the last earnings call, very much in line with our expectations as how we ended up in the first quarter. As it relates -- and you know what the usual puts and takes are as it relates to what drives this incentive, so I won't kind of repeat that. But the reality is, we continue to be out in the market, working to win business. We've got a strong pipeline of deals. We'll continue to execute on that. You hear about them on every earnings call. As it relates to the second quarter, as we see it right now, we expect rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to slightly down from what we saw in the first quarter. So the reality is -- I want to kind of just make sure we put this in perspective, right? We do these rebates and incentives to bring more volume onto our network. When we bring more volume onto our network, it gives us the opportunity to optimize those portfolios to grow them at a faster pace, it helps us deliver more services, which helps us drive net revenue accretion from a yield standpoint. And so it's very much in line with our strategy, and that's what I've got in the nature of thoughts for the second quarter. Sure. I'll take the first part of your question. As it relates to cross-border travel, really, what we are seeing is exactly what we said, which is the lower growth rate that you're seeing in the first 4 weeks of April, as we've seen and we've analyzed as being primarily driven by just the timing of Easter. There's nothing unusual to call out. The only thing I will say is when you think about cross-border travel, you should think about it in the context of also tougher comps, particularly as it relates to Asia because Asia was late to come out of the restrictions of COVID. So last year, you saw a strong recovery take place in terms of cross-border travel in Asia and then it just creates [ for ] tougher comps this year. But fundamentally, the value prop is very sound. We've got great portfolios, we continue to win portfolios which are travel leaning, cross-border travel leaning, and we're executing on this portfolio. So nothing unusual that I'm seeing, travel growth rates are very healthy, and they're actually, I would say, are running at a cliff, which is -- when I go back to the pre COVID days, it actually is running at a cliff, which is pretty comparable to what we used to see in the pre COVID days when adjusted for the timing of Easter and the comp impact. Sure. Tien-Tsin, I'll take that. So like I mentioned, right, I mean, first of all, our overall outlook and the demand we're seeing for our value-added services and solutions continues to be quite compelling and strong. I mean we're out there actively, as Michael mentioned earlier, driving and pushing harder across the various sectors, which we kind of talked about. So I won't repeat them. As it relates to the thoughts I shared as it relates to growth rates for value-added services and solutions for the remaining quarters of the year, which I said that the growth rates would be higher in each of the quarters compared to Q1. It's really based on what we're seeing in the nature of the pipeline, how we're seeing things shape up in terms of the cadence of how we're going to deliver on these value-added services and solutions, we feel pretty good about the outlook there, which is why we're sharing with you what we're thinking about in the nature of this higher growth relative to Q1 in each of the quarters. \n The only other comment I'll make is it's a little bit of a reminder out here, which is, as we deliver on these value-added services and solutions, we're obviously generating revenue from the value-added services and solutions but that's also driving very compelling kind of cases for us to accelerate our payments growth, right? So that's part and parcel of the strategy. It's all kind of very independent, one or the other. On your other question, which was around other solutions growth, look, we continue to remain focused on growing the other solutions. It's primarily comprised of our real-time infrastructure assets as in our bill payment assets. \n That inherently is slightly slower growth compared to what we've got in our safety and security solutions, our consulting and marketing, loyalty solutions, so we'll continue to drive on that. I don't necessarily expect that the growth rates there are going to get comparable to what we see on the safety and security side as well as in the consulting and marketing and loyalty solutions side, primarily because the opportunity which is there on Safety and Security and Consulting is a much larger TAM and it's a faster-growing TAM, and we're continuing to execute on it. The good news is -- the safety and security fees as well as the consulting and marketing and data analytics and insights component is the lion's share of what comprises our value-added services and solutions. Just 1 more point I'll add, David, as it relates -- we've had this long-standing focus on conversion of Maestro to Debit Mastercard, and that's very much the case in Europe as well that we continue to execute on that. I feel like that's going to be one of those things which will continue to provide us a natural tailwind as we continue to execute on that capability. For example, in this quarter, we migrated or converted very roughly 7 million consumers from Maestro to debit Mastercard. And that's a global number. That's not just a Europe number, but I just want to share that with you as another piece of how we're executing in Europe. As it relates to while we're on the topic of cross-border travel, I just wanted to kind of share where we are in terms of where we see potential for some recovery, which is particularly in Asia Pacific, which has got still some room to grow. [ Case in point ] would be China, where we've shared these metrics with you in the past, but I'll share with you what the Q1 metric was inbound and outbound of China. So in Q1, cross-border travel, inbound and outbound into and from China stood at approximately 80% of the pre-COVID level. So there's still room to recover. And granted China is going through a little bit of a slower period in terms of how the domestic economy is performing. But the reality is there still remains an opportunity over the medium to long term to see how this recovery comes through in the nature of travel even from that corridor, per se. Sure. So first, I just want to quickly remind you that as it relates to the impact of FX volatility in our instance, that shows up in our transaction processing assessments. It doesn't show up in our cross-border assessment. So the impact of the, what I would say, the drag associated with FX volatility shows up in this transaction processing assessment line. It doesn't show up in our cross-border assessment line, point number one. Point number two, you're right about the yields. Our portfolios continue to perform well. It goes back to what Michael said earlier, we want to win not only every portfolio, but we want to win the right portfolios. And that's what we focused on doing over the last few years, which is winning the right portfolios for cross-border and what that's helped us do is see this favorable mix come through where we are seeing the inter cross-border grow at a more rapid pace than the intra-Europe cross-border. \n And you do know that the yields on the inter cross-border side are higher than the yields on intra cross-border, intra-Europe cross-border. So that certainly helps from a yield standpoint. And then as it relates to your question on pricing, look, we've always kind of done pricing for the value we deliver when we deliver value to our customers, whether it's on the issuing side of the acquiring side, we price for it. I called out that in this quarter, we had a little bit of a lift come through on pricing in the cross-border assessments line. And you'll see that come through the ensuing quarters as the year progresses as well. Yes. Look, I mean, the A&M spend is typically -- it's a cadence of how we see the promotions we want to do. So let me just step back and kind of think a little bit about why we spend on A&M. You could do it at the brand level, but you could do it towards activation of sponsorships. And depending on when your sponsorship assets are in play is when you want to do the activation around those sponsorship assets. So that influences the cadence of spend on A&M. So you're right, we had lower A&M in the first quarter. I kind of mentioned in my prepared remarks about how it's the timing of A&M. What I was basically alluding to is that as the year progresses, we will be spending more on the advertising and marketing line. \n On the second part of your question as to the toggling factor between the expense line and what we might be giving in terms of marketing or marketing spend in terms of [ contract ]. There is an element of marketing, which we do give in terms of rebates and incentives to drive portfolio spend. We work very closely with our issuing partners on that. And so it's across both of those that we are looking to actually optimize from a marketing standpoint. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Miebach",
            "content": "Thank you, Devin. Good morning, everyone. Our momentum continued this quarter as we once again delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Quarter 1 net revenues were up 11% and adjusted net income up 16% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. These results were powered by healthy consumer spending and strong cross-border volume growth of 18% year-over-year on a local currency basis. We had new deal wins in every region, and we're driving growth by scaling our innovative technologies. That's why people choose Mastercard, a simple, seamless and secure way to pay. With these strong results, we are reiterating our full year 2024 outlook for both net revenue and operating expense on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. On the macroeconomic front, the picture remains mixed. First, strong labor markets and solid wage growth remain in countries across the globe. This is supportive of healthy consumer spending. Second, inflation has been moderating with a path towards normalization of monetary policy in most countries. Persistent inflation in the United States could delay rate cuts here. And third, geopolitical uncertainty remains in several countries. In addition to these areas, we are closely monitoring the strength of the dollar, commodity prices and consumer balance sheet health. With tailwinds and headwinds to economic growth remain on balance, we are positive about the growth outlook. With this backdrop, we are focused on our strategic priorities: consumer payments, new flows and services and new networks. The recent realignment of our organizational structure will help our teams to execute on these priorities faster to deliver more value to our partners and customers. \n In payments, our growth algorithm consists of being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments, further penetrating new flows, growing market share and optimizing our customer portfolios. I will address a few of those. Starting with the shift to digital for person to merchant payments, this secular opportunity has been a very important component of our growth algorithm across both volume and transactions. We are confident this will continue over the long term. Our acceptance footprint is a key competitive advantage, and we continue to expand our reach globally while enhancing the user experience for digital transactions through our technologies. Our fast and secure Contactless technology has been instrumental in displacing cash. Contactless now represents more than 2 of every 3 in-person [ switch ] purchase transactions, up from 1 in 3 prior to the pandemic. And our Tap on Phone capabilities are simply a cost-effective way for merchants of all sizes to accept digital card payments. We're now live in over 100 markets. In Brazil alone, the number of active devices is now over 1.5 million. And Apple continues to expand Tap to Pay on iPhone in markets like Brazil, where recently the solution was rolled out by fintechs, Stone, [ NuBank ], SumUp and Cloud Walk. As payments become more digital, there is an increasing demand from consumers and merchants for a simpler and more secure payment experience. Whether online or through a wallet provider, our tokens, deliver an elevated level of security and payment credentials are shared between the bank and the merchant. This improves the performance of a client's portfolio while supporting new ways to pay. This key differentiator creates a flywheel effect. Lower fraud, higher approval rates and a better consumer experience bring more transactions and volume to the MasterCard network, which in turn drives more payments revenue and brings more data. Tokens also create a streamlined way to accelerate the monetization of associated services to our customers. \n In quarter 1, tokenized transactions grew over 50% year-over-year with more room to go as only approximately 1 in 4 transactions on the MasterCard network are tokenized today. Further opportunity lies in the verticals traditionally underpenetrated by Card. Merchants are embracing solutions to simplify checkout, reduce missed payments and drive engagement. We are focused on segments such as housing and health care that have sizable spend and where our solutions can address the needs of providers and consumers. Rent payments is one vertical where we are working with aggregators to enable digital payments. \n In health care, we're partnering with several providers to grow acceptance in key markets like Germany. And we are playing in the gaming community or puns intended, with partners like global video game commerce company, Xsolla to improve the payment experience. The opportunity to bring more transactions onto the Mastercard network remains. We now switch approximately 2/3 of our total transactions worldwide, up from approximately 55% in 2018. Our actions in markets where switching penetration was historically low like Japan, Mexico, Colombia and Chile have increased this penetration, and we will continue to focus on this. My takeaway for you is the secular opportunity is large and it's lasting, and we are well positioned to go after it. Our momentum also continues with issuers and co-brand partners as we are winning new deals and retaining key business in every region. \n Starting in the Americas. In the fi quarter, we further solidified our position in Brazil. signing an agreement with Banco Bradesco, one of the largest banks in the market across credit, commercial and services. We're making great progress in converting the previously announced debit wins in the United States. The Fiserv Money Network card program for the California Employment Development Department has now gone live with Mastercard. On the conversions of Citizens and Webster, we are well underway. We're further strengthening our leadership position with retail co-brands in the U.S., Mastercard will be the exclusive network for the Citi issued Dillard's co-brand. We have also extended our long-standing partnerships with Target and the TJX companies. In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, we signed a 10-year exclusive partnership with First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest bank in the UAE. The agreement spans consumer and commercial issuance across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt. We entered into a new exclusive co-brand agreement across the EMEA region with Global Hotel Alliance, the world's largest alliance of independent hotel brands. And in India, we signed a 10-year consumer credit issuance deal with Axis Bank.  And finally, in Europe, we extended our long-standing partnership with [indiscernible]. The deal renews our payments relationship with one of the largest banks in the region while continuing to embed comprehensive marketing, consulting and loyalty solutions. These examples, like many others, are true partnerships. Our teams are invested in making them a win-win experience, and we will continue to use our innovative product capabilities and differentiated service offerings and our solution selling approach [ produce ] positive results for our customers and for Mastercard. Now you asked before, why are we winning? That's exactly why we're winning.  \n Moving next to the new flows pillar of our growth algorithm. We continue to execute against our strategy to further penetrate the addressable market in targeted areas like commercial payments, and disbursements and remittances. Growth in commercial is about making sure we are connected to the right partners and have the right solutions to power growth. made great strides in securing key partnerships, including traditional banks, travel and ERP providers. We previously announced our expanded agreement with Wells Fargo in the U.S. As part of our small business relationship, I'm happy to share that we've made significant progress in the conversion of this card portfolio to the Mastercard network. Also this quarter, we won our first commercial credit issue deal with SBI Card in India. In commercial solutions [ we're ] components of the Banco Bradesco and First Abu Dhabi Bank deals I mentioned earlier.  \n In addition to aligning with the right partners, it's also about having the right solutions to help commercial clients address their needs, like consumers, they want an easy and secure payment experience. Our new innovative mobile virtual card app enables commercial cards to be seamlessly added to digital wallets as we do as a consumer, but businesses can easily enable employees to pay for expenses with a click and a smile. At the same time, they can optimize back-office processes with robust spend controls, enhanced reconciliation data. HSBC Australia and Westpac will be the first financial institutions to offer this solution. The same principle applies to the open-loop commercial fleet space, where we are the market leader. Our differentiated capabilities have positioned us as a preferred partner with the market-leading fleet providers such as Corepay. And fleet fintech AtoB has announced they will now convert their commercial credit card program exclusively to the Mastercard network.  \n And sticking to new flows, disbursement and remittances, we continue to extend our reach to new markets. In quarter 1, we grew transactions by over 40%, [ in combined ], our portfolio of domestic and international money movement capabilities into 1 offering, Mastercard Move. It includes our Mastercard Send and cross-border services and reaches nearly 10 billion endpoints worldwide. This quarter, we extended our reach further in China with our connection to Alipay, in the U.S., we're partnering with Verituity to create a white label solution for banks to modernize their disbursements and remittances through a plug-and-play solution. And we will work with Sweden based Pagero to support account-based cross-border and domestic payments.  \n Now shifting from payments to services and new networks, another important component of our growth algorithm. It starts with a powerful set of diversified solutions with best-in-class fraud capabilities, data analytics, consulting, marketing, loyalty, identity and open banking assets. These carefully curated assets help us grow and diversify our revenues and differentiate our payments. We drive growth in services and new networks across several vectors. First, remember, a portion of our services revenue is driven by payments. and these metrics continue to perform well. In addition, we're driving growth by increasing the penetration of existing customers. We're extending our services across new customers and new payment flows and we build and deploy new solutions.  \n Here are a few examples of how we're executing against these. Starting with increasing penetration with existing customers, success in delivering our services, strengthen relationships and can generate opportunities for future service engagements. Our best-in-class conversion support is often an entry point. A great example is with Westpac in Australia and New Zealand, where we expanded our service offerings to include digital strategy, marketing solutions, innovation sprints and portfolio optimization campaigns. We have a diverse set of solutions to also help banks manage critical business needs outside of payments, take credit risk, for example, core to all banks. Our consultants are working with Ford Brazil to improve their credit policies and management.  \n In a Saudi National Bank, we are enabling new credit risk modeling and scoring capabilities. There's still room to further penetrate services. Our top 50 services customers on average are using 2 to 3x more services than the balance of our issuing and acquiring customer base. We're also driving growth by extending our reach across multiple rails and networks outside of the Mastercard network. Mastercard Access provides customers with a single trusted connection to quickly and easily source a suite of services and we are seeing great traction. For example, Saudi National Bank will leverage Access to deploy a set of scheme-agnostic services across their portfolio. We also continue to innovate and develop new services and solutions. This helps us to meet the evolving needs of our clients while growing our addressable target market. Here's an example. Think about how people are shifting to streaming and other digital services. As they do, they're looking for 1 simple view of all their subscriptions. I think we've all been there. It's why we developed smart subscriptions. It's an open banking powered solution that puts a simple dashboard of all subscriptions regardless of network right into their consumer banking application. Cybercrime is a growing concern, last year alone, people in the United States lost over $12 billion to Internet scams. Scam Protect builds on the cybersecurity protections we have delivered for years, combines our identity biometric AI and open banking capabilities to identify and prevent scans before they occur. As part of this, we're partnering with organizations around the world, including Verizon, to collaborate on new solutions to protect consumers. By combining Mastercard's Identity Insights with Verizon's robust network technologies, new AI power tools will be designed to more accurately identify and block scammers. We continue to enhance our solutions with generative AI to deliver even more value, a world-leading real-time fraud solution, Decision Intelligence, has been helping banks score and safely approve billions of transactions, ensuring the safety of consumers and the entire payments networks for years. The next-generation technology, Decision Intelligence Pro is supercharged by generative AI to improve the overall score and boost fraud detection rates on average by 20%. So overall, there's a strong demand for our services and new networks across a diverse customer base. They continue to grow faster than the core, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead. With that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We are successfully executing against our strategy in realizing our growth algorithm. Our differentiated capabilities, our diversified business model and our focused strategy poses well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you. So on China, we got the license in November, and we shared our excitement about that. So the excitement continues. The teams have been busy building out issuance relationships with our banking partners in China and building out the acceptance footprint. We're obviously not starting from 0 here. We had a strong cross-border business. So we have relationships in play that give us a heads up. There was a time line associated with the license, and we're expecting to go live with the first transactions to a very specific question here in the month of May. As far as using existing cards in China, I think the key question here behind that is -- how can you use existing acceptance in China and start to generate volume. And here, our approach is through the partnership with the digital wallets to have cards put into the digital wallet so they can be used at the whole wide range of merchants in China. So I do want to say we are excited. At the same time, it's clear we're going to start processing, [indiscernible] transactions domestically, this is a medium- to long-term opportunity. In the short term, there's more work that we need to do to build out more acceptance and continue to get more card programs out, but we feel very encouraged about that. Our teams are very busy with that activity. Ramsey, you are hitting on a really important point. value-added services, a key differentiator for our payment solutions, payment solutions. The link is pretty clear, more volume, more data, and I talked about the whole growth algorithm earlier on the call. Now this doesn't just naturally have to us. It requires really focused execution. To your point, we are all at any point in time, very clear what our cross-sell ratios are, what value we can offer to our customers and who we have it offered to and who we haven't offered it to. I give you a stat earlier that talked about that you have 2 to 3x more services with our top 50 customers. So there is tremendous potential in there. And our teams are very focused on that. Across the company, we have our existing relationship manager, sales force out there across the whole world, but we're also having a set of very specific more hunter-oriented sales forces that drive very specific new products with deep value that we drive into separate selling centers into these customers. So it's a pretty broad approach. At any point in time, we see that data, and we drive that because as you said, this is a near-term growth opportunity that we should leverage and we will. Right. Thanks, Harshita. So the first word, I would say, relief. This has been long standing, and we are happy that there was an agreement found with the merchant community as well as with Visa and this is behind us. So what this was about is the U.S. merchant rules class. So what was in focus here was the business rules that make up the Mastercard promise. And the conversation was around how can we provide opportunities to merchants to manage their cost of acceptance on 1 hand, at the same time, how do we keep the major promise to consumers of the Mastercard brand and that is, you can pay anywhere and you will not be discriminated against your payment. So that was the toggle over the years and an agreement was reached. And basically, what happens is we're going to have a mild reduction of interchange rates, number one. and we're providing more clarity and simplification around surcharging rules and discounting rules on the 1 hand. At the same time, we retain the promise of [ to ] honor all card rule out there. So that is what is out there. We don't expect any dramatic impact on the business from the interchange changes. And for merchants, they -- we will see what the choices they make on surcharging and on discounting. We've seen in the past that surcharging is not always clear to consumers. It's not always prepared, so we'll see what choices will come up. So broadly speaking, I don't expect a major impact on our business. In terms of financial impact, we have accounted for the legal fees associated with that. Otherwise, there is no impact directly on Mastercard. So all in, a very good outcome, and it proves 1 point. It proves the point that there is a lot of momentum and a lot of competition in the payments market and yet again another moving item and merchants agreed to this, and this is a good step forward for everybody. Yes. It's a competitive marketplace. So we have to be competitive on the financial side. We clearly see the flywheel effect that Sachin just talked about between payments and services, more volume on, more ability to sell our services. But it's also clear that we are very, very focused on what deals we want to win. So we don't want to win every deal and we're very, very targeted here whatever meets our financial criteria and our strategic focus in certain markets and certain verticals. Right, just a last comment on travel and tourism in general. Sachin earlier mentioned that the Chinese government is really focused on driving inbound tourism. I just came back from a series of trips Indonesia, 1 of them, and you see yet another government that is driving inbound tourism. We see it in India. We see it in Spain and so forth. In order to work with governments and how to actually do that. There's a whole practice around our public sector business to build out, use the data that we have to create not -- in order to aid the portfolios that we have, create approaches with governments to promote their respective destinations. And all this comes hand-in-hand to a much more holistic approach that we're now seeing around travel vis-a-vis competitors out there. So that was 1 thing I wanted to add. \n On the conversion piece and the shift to digital payments, you asked specifically about the United States. I want to hang it up a little bit broader. Starting off with -- there is a tremendous secular opportunity from a geographic perspective. So there is opportunity left here in the United States, but if you look around the world and you see some other countries, G7 economies like Italy, you have 45% cash. So tremendous opportunity even in developed opportunities to -- developed companies to go after that. I just mentioned Indonesia. In Indonesia, you have over 70% cash. So this is a country where the President has put out by 2045. They're going to be the fourth largest economy in the world, 280 million people. So there's the whole range across developed and developing economies for us to continue to go and push into. \n You heard us talk about changing behaviors post-COVID. People are ordering more takeout foods and doing more things generally online, and that is generally a preferential place for card transactions. So going into these verticals is important. We gave you the example on a number of occasions of takeout food. That's 1 transaction in the restaurants, but multiple transactions as you pay your platform, the platform pays the restaurant and so forth. But think about public transport is another example. Here, we're talking real scale around the globe. So that is multiple transactions as consumers get into open-loop systems multiple times a day. And when they get out of the station, they use that same tapping behavior as they buy a coffee and so forth. So there's tremendous transaction opportunity driven by change in behaviors of consumers. And there's whole new sectors, as I mentioned about in the prepared remarks, health care, rent and so forth. So the secular opportunity, this was not just a throwaway comment earlier when I say it's big and it's lasting. It goes up exactly in those layers, and we are very focused on each and every 1 of those layers. So this is around for a while. [indiscernible] back to the piece, Tien-Tsin, as we discussed earlier about existing customers and the cross-sell. So that's an opportunity. We laid out the drive into new customer segments. So that's pretty clear. In here, give you an example, on the personalization thing, our Dynamic Yield acquisitions dating back to [ 2020 ], you have a lot of high-end retail and commerce brands that I want to engage on that. Everybody is trying to cut through the clutter, take Saks Fifth Avenue, they're using our personalization services. So those are all opportunities to get into certain verticals that we're not even in today in a significant way. So that is what gives us great confidence, there's great demand as we look ahead into services, and that's why we're saying they're going to be higher than the first quarter. David, Europe's a fantastic growth story for Mastercard, starting off with some of the big shifts in debit in the U.K., some great wins on the continent. Earlier, I was talking about the renewal of [indiscernible], some big deals that are still in flight on conversion if you think about UniCredit, 13 markets across the continent. So we're well positioned here. Obviously, Europe is in focus from a set of competitors that is local players as in local schemes and so forth, but we've long found a way to partner with them. we feel they have a great proposition on credit and debit to compete. At the same time, there are services partnerships that we drive across and then more traditional competitors, of course, we're all eyeing Europe. Europe is too much of a growth story overall for everybody to keep competing. But we, as I said earlier, we try to turn these relationships into win-win partnerships. UniCredit in the end decided to go with us because they feel we have shown better traction in serving their customer needs. So it comes down to that, and I feel pretty confident as I look across Europe. And it continues to be a growth opportunity. Back to this question about secular opportunity. Europe still has a lot to offer on that front, and we have a whole set of solutions to go after that. All right. Let me start off on this and then Sachin can comment further. So you've seen the 18% growth, so this is strong. So there's a travel component to that, and there is an ex travel component to that. Ex travel continues to be particularly strong, it's cross-border e-commerce and the [ likes ]. On the travel side, if you break that down, we talked about the trends. I want to lift it up a little bit to the broader -- I think the broader angle of your question. So what are the various things that consumers think about as they make spending decisions, how did it make ends meet and travel has been strong ever since COVID, particularly strong from a recovery perspective and has been strong even for COVID because the seeking of experience is just a fundamental trend that hasn't gone away. \n So it's not one of those circular things. This is just a secular trend that we see. People are seeking services and experiences and travel is the top of the list. Now as you go and break this down into different countries, you're going to see different stages of inflation. You're going to see different monetary policy and fiscal policy, how governments and regulators are reacting to inflation and so forth. And that affects consumers in different ways. If you see inflation in non-carded verticals, that's going to impact your payment decisions or your spending decisions on carded verticals and so forth. So it's a pretty not uniform story around the world. that's why I come back to the fundamental trend. Travel is winning. People want to go out and make that trip. And hence, we remain pretty optimistic around that. Right, so Tim, great point. We love to talk about debit. You saw the 6% growth rate. So this is good. We're doing well, and the impact of the conversions is felt. As far as it comes to routing and Reg II, this question comes up for now for a couple of calls. And I have to say where we are, we're seeing some impact, but it's not material. That comes to the bigger question that you raised, how do we look at that? So it's not material, that's great. That gives us even more reason to look at the opportunity side of this and you're fighting for back of card. And in the end, it comes down to the routing mandates, such as just distorting the market. I think what's happening here is it's ignoring the fact that in the end, a merchant will make a decision on the basis of a net economic outcome. And the net economic outcome is not just the cost of operating related to some routing costs but it is fraud costs, et cetera, the whole package altogether. And this is, I think, where we score well because we have a better proposition. Last 5 years, we've invested $7 billion into Safety and Security Solutions and that makes a competitive advantage for us. So -- and that makes for a competitive advantage for us. So I see the opportunity, our teams are out. They're talking to merchants that saying, \"Here's what the net proposition is if you choice A versus choice B. And so far, that is an encouraging set of dialogues. Right. So what we're doing here is you heard us talk about the growth algorithm, about our strategic priorities. In the end, what's happening here is we're realigning our portfolio of activities, always recognizing these are all interdependent. We're talking payments and services and altogether, it makes our competitive advantage position. But we basically say, we want to focus on core payments. We want to focus on new payment flows, and we want to focus on an integrated services set of offerings. And that is what is part of this announcement, plus we see tremendous opportunity on the AI side, particularly on the generative AI side, and we've created a central role for that. So these are 4 very seasoned leaders in the company that have tremendous experience around these topics. They're going to take this on and the whole idea is to move faster and drive more value to our customers. In terms of financial impact, what I hope to see is we kind of deliver the growth that we think is out there in terms of potential. That is the impact that I'm looking for. So that's really the play. There's nothing else to say beyond that. I'm looking -- talking to Craig, who's going to lead the services [ saying ], what is going to be on our product road map going forward? How do we drive even more services growth, et cetera. So that's the whole play. It's bringing structure strategy in line and move forward. Right. The last comment I want to make on this. So we are a very large fintech, but we're not just a fintech. We have a massive consumer brand. It's a fast-moving brand. It's amongst the top 10 brands on Brand Z, so investing in marketing is absolutely critical. This is not a trade-off that we make to -- from quarter-over-quarter, it fluctuates at exactly the way that Sachin just talked about, when is the Champions League on? When is this on this on, when is that on, and we have a very carefully curated set of sponsorship assets and it drive a bit of the timing. But we love our brand, we invest in it. I think for the fifth year in a row, we have been the #1 Sonic brand in the world. So there's a lot going on, on the marketing side that we are very proud about. And I think that brings us to the end. What a great question to end the call on. Thank you so much. It is Labor Day in most parts of the world today. So when I thank our colleagues yet again, which I do in every call, on Labor Day, it makes even more sense. SO a big call out to the 33,000 at Mastercard, and thank you to you and our shareholders for your continued support. Thank you very much. Speak to you next quarter. Bye-bye."
