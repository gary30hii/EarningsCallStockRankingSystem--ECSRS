[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host to Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2020 results and 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call maybe forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss our key accomplishments and our strategic priorities. Wayde will share our 2020 financial results and introduce our 2021 guidance. And then we will open the call for your questions. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to another very successful year for Insulet. In the face of extraordinary challenges, we executed our strategy, delivered consistently strong growth and advanced our key imperatives. This past year, more than any other, clearly demonstrated the loyalty of our customers, the durability of our pay-as-you-go model and the strong value proposition of our differentiated technology. What we have accomplished in 2020 is a clear indicator of the resiliency and strength of our people and our culture. Together, we embraced a new reality, while staying committed to our core mission we not only supported each other, but also our customers and the communities we serve. One of Insulet\u2019s greatest strengths is our mission-driven customer centric culture. This was particularly evident this past year as our team rose to the challenges and showed an incredible ability to learn, adapt and perform in an ambiguous and rapidly changing environment. We executed with an unwavering commitment to our customers and delivered another compelling year of growth. Our mission remains the same improve the lives of people with diabetes and every Insulet employee drives towards this goal with unmatched passion. In the face of COVID, we didn\u2019t miss a beat and we consistently advanced our innovation, commercial and operational initiatives. We entered 2021 with strong momentum with our Omnipod 5 commercial launch on track and expanding clinical and innovation pipeline and a growing global addressable market. In 2020, we delivered over 20% annual revenue growth for the fifth consecutive year, a remarkable achievement, given upended working conditions and market challenges. In fact, we finished 2020 ahead of our beginning of the year pre-COVID expectations. We achieved record annual and quarterly revenue for both our U.S. and international Omnipod product lines. We also completed the year with a fourth quarter record number of global new customers, driven by U.S. new customer starts that were higher than any quarter in Insulet\u2019s history. While we finished the year strong and overcame most of the pandemic\u2019s challenges, it certainly impacted our global new customer additions during 2020. As we look to 2021, this will serve as a slight headwind to revenue growth. Nevertheless, our financial performance has been impressive and our overall outlook remains strong. Let\u2019s turn to our strategic imperatives centered around expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. I will start with access and awareness and what we are doing to deliver the best customer experience. Our primary goal is simple, breakdown existing access barriers for Omnipod. There are far too many people living with diabetes that don\u2019t have access to or are unaware of Omnipod\u2019s many benefits compared to other therapies. Outcomes are being limited because access traditionally has been too complicated and too costly. Omnipod offers a simple, discrete form factor and an easy-to-use product platform that is unmatched. We provide our customers broad, affordable access and a simpler customer experience while making it easier to prescribe for physicians. Our new customer starts, industry leading retention and customer loyalty are clear indicators of the value Omnipod delivers. We continue to attract approximately 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. And in the fourth quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new Omnipod customers were Type 2, up from Q3. Our current system, Omnipod DASH, not only marked our move to mobile technology and represents the platform for our next generations, it also is powering our success, attracting both MDI users and individuals with Type 1 and Type 2, as well as expanding pharmacy access. By the end of the fourth quarter, we had secured coverage for approximately 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, up significantly from last quarter. Today, most of our new customers throughout the globe start on Omnipod DASH. While we remain focused on providing our customers easy access through our pay-as-you-go model and the U.S. pharmacy channel, we also continue to increase Omnipod awareness of the benefits we deliver to people living with diabetes. The diabetes market is dramatically underserved and increased Omnipod awareness is driving growth. Our recent direct-to-consumer advertising campaign has provided us with great insight. The reaction to our pilot and the early read of key leading indicators, have been positive. So we have decided to continue advertising to support our efforts. We look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year. Taking a step back, Omnipod adoption and retention have been incredibly strong despite not having a CGM integrated product in the marketplace. This year, that technological gap will not only be closed, it will be surpassed. We are thrilled to be on the verge of introducing our next evolution of consumer-focused innovation. We could not be more excited, and we know our customers and our future customers have been waiting for our transformative technology. Omnipod 5, our automated insulin delivery system in partnership with DexCom, is designed to deliver unmatched freedom for people living with diabetes and to greatly simplify insulin management and improve glucose control. We will be the first tubeless entirely wearable AID system with the algorithm on the pod. Other than a pod change every 3 days, there will be no need to disconnect or stop therapy. And the number one request from current and prospective customers is the ability to control the pod from a personal smartphone. Our system will be the first to provide full smartphone control. This means we can remove an entire component of the system, resulting in reduced burden and dramatically improved simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to provide our customers much more and to ask them to do much less. Omnipod 5 will first launch with control from Android mobile phones and all customers will receive a backup personal diabetes manager with SIM technology. This ensures constant connectivity to data even when not near a Wi-Fi and this allows for real-time remote monitoring. With Omnipod 5, parents will always know how their children are doing on our system. We have heard from many about how much of a relief it is to have confidence in Omnipod 5 to control glucose and be able to periodically monitor their children in real-time. As a result, trial participants have told us that their families are finally sleeping and that they are better parents and spouses since starting on Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is disruptive technology that we believe will revolutionize the market and the lives of people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are on track for a limited commercial launch in the United States in the first half of this year with pharmacy access and our pay-as-you-go model. Unlike other therapies, Omnipod 5 customers will not have to pay upfront, nor will they have an upgrade fee or be locked into a 4-year contract. Anyone with coverage, even existing tube pump users can try Omnipod at any time for free with our 30 days of freedom trial. Omnipod 5 will be offered at price parity with Omnipod DASH in the U.S. while we know our Aid system commands a premium, our focus is on securing broad payer coverage and customer access. Like Omnipod DASH, the majority of Omnipod 5 customers will have a pharmacy monthly co-pay of under $50. Pricing Omnipod 5 at the same level as Omnipod DASH will drive affordable coverage, accelerated customer adoption and is consistent with our efforts to eliminate barriers and broaden access. We anticipate we will be in a limited launch period for the majority of this year. This gives us time to secure broad pharmacy coverage since Omnipod 5 will be available in only this channel. We are confident Omnipod 5 will be a game changer for people living with diabetes and believe the primary driver of a broader commercial rollout will be consumer access. We have invested ahead to build our manufacturing and supply chain operations and are more than prepared to meet market demand. As we gear up for our highly anticipated launch, we continue to build clinical evidence to support many applications of Omnipod 5 as we believe our technology can provide enormous value to broad groups of patients within multiple markets and settings. We, therefore, will continue to heavily invest clinically and have a robust road map, including our ongoing work to expand our indication to preschoolers, ages 2 to 6. We recently completed our preschool pivotal study, and we are compiling the data for submission to the FDA. The study had 80 young children on product, and we are delighted to share that 100% have completed the trial and 100% have elected to continue into an extension phase. This is a clear indication of the value that Omnipod 5 can deliver for these young children. And we continue to plan for an expanded indication by the end of this year. Also, enrollment for our Type 2 feasibility study continues. Upon that study\u2019s completion, we plan to conduct additional studies with the goal to further expand Omnipod 5\u2019s indications. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, we look forward to presenting our Omnipod 5 pivotal data at the Endo conference next month. If our pre pivotal data is any indication, it should demonstrate just how powerful Omnipod 5 is for improved outcomes and improved quality of life. We are incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and a successful rollout remains our top priority. But we also continue to advance an innovation road map that extends well beyond our AID system. In fact, in 2020, we doubled the number of product development employees to support our robust road map, particularly in the areas of software development and data science. We are committed to investing in future innovations to deliver increased value to our customers for many years to come. We are working on innovation programs designed to drive unparalleled simplicity of our user interactions with our systems, improved outcomes through algorithm advancements, insights and value from our growing data sets and analytics and user choice of sensor and smartphone integrations. We are committed to integrating Omnipod 5 in our future generations with multiple CGM platforms, and are delighted to be partnering with DexCom and Abbott Libre in these efforts. Their CGM offerings are helping to drive increased Omnipod adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 segments. This is extremely beneficial as the global diabetes market remains critically underserved and far too many people remain uninformed about their treatment options. By working together, we expect to deliver a long line of innovative offerings that further improve the lives of millions of people around the globe. Now turning to global expansion, during the fourth quarter, we entered 5 new countries within Europe and the Middle East. Just this week, we expanded into Turkey and plan to launch in Australia later on this year. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are in a strong position to capitalize on this large addressable market, given our focus to provide simple and widespread access to Omnipod. A technology we know greatly simplifies lives and provides better outcomes and quality of life. We are expanding internationally in a targeted and strategic manner and are building our go-to-market plans to enter larger geographies over time. We expect our total addressable market will grow significantly as we continue to expand internationally, bring innovations like Omnipod 5 to market and further displace legacy therapies. We have made significant investments throughout our entire global business to support our robust innovation pipeline and global expansion. And in the face of COVID, the progress we made this past year in our manufacturing and supply chain operations was remarkable. We not only maintained a high-quality production, kept facilities open and met product demand levels. We also opened a new manufacturing facility in China and installed our third U.S. manufacturing line, further expanding our manufacturing and supply chain redundancy. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, finished the year on a high note and entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business. Our competitive differentiators remain unparalleled. And the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 will significantly strengthen our market position, and marks a major milestone in our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Shacey. Our fourth quarter results completed another year of solid growth and execution. Although challenged with the pandemic through 2020, we entered 2021 with positive momentum. This past year, we meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives. Our focus to invest for accelerated revenue growth and expand margins while strengthening our financial profile will continue to drive significant value for all of our stakeholders and further our mission. In the fourth quarter, we delivered over 15% revenue growth, $9 million above our guidance range. The key driver of this outperformance was total Omnipod growth of 18%, which was $8 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery also finished slightly ahead of expectations by $1 million. While the pandemic was less of a headwind than initially estimated, it negatively impacted global new customer starts throughout 2020, largely beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, this dynamic created a compounding impact on revenue in the second half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect the impact to revenue will continue in 2021, although to a lessening degree. In the fourth quarter, the impact on new customer starts was more favorable than estimated in both the U.S. and international regions, with a combined effect of approximately 10% off of our beginning-of-the-year expectations. We were encouraged to see continued sequential improvements as we added almost 40% more global new customers in Q4 than we did in Q3. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 18% in the fourth quarter. Our solid top line performance was driven by our growing customer base, increased Omnipod DASH adoption and the continued mix benefit as we shift into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove over 65% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 35% of our total U.S. volume. This represents a continued increase in adoption of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. Moving forward, shifting our business model to the pharmacy remains a key priority as it reduces barriers and drives expanded access for Omnipod is more efficient for our customers, provides low, more predictable out-of-pocket costs and is easier to prescribe for physicians. Not to mention the number of benefits for payers. International on Omnipod revenue also grew 18%, driven by a growing customer base and more favorable performance in Europe than expected. Despite COVID related shutdowns in many European countries. Global attrition and utilization were again stable in the quarter. Drug delivery revenue decreased 11% due to timing of production. Gross margin was 65.5% in the fourth quarter, representing a 150 basis point increase, in line with our expectations. Our gross margin expansion continues to be driven primarily by our improved U.S. manufacturing operations as we further ramp our new automated lines as well as the ongoing benefit of volume mix shift into the pharmacy channel. Foreign currency was a 70 basis point tailwind, partially offset by a 40 basis point headwind from COVID related safety and mitigation costs. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were above our expectations due to a $15 million charge related to the resolution of a contingency payment we disclosed the positive resolution in late December, and we\u2019re pleased to have reached favorable terms with our former European distributor and within our estimated range. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were in line with our expectations, including a stock award to all employees for their execution in a very challenging environment, as well as to mark our 20th anniversary as a company. As a result, we incurred a $7 million expense relating to a one-time equity bonus. This grant also serves as a way for our employees to be more invested in our company and our future, especially as we enter an exciting new phase with the launch of Omnipod 5 this charge was offset somewhat by lower R&D and selling and marketing expenses due to timing of projects, which we now expect will occur in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 14% in Q4, down from 17% in the prior year. We continue to invest throughout our business, including increases in advertising and brand awareness, innovation as well as scaling our global business to support our growth. For the full year, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 23% and total company revenue growth of 22%, achieving another record year and further illustrating the strength and durability of our annuity revenue model. In 2020, we achieved gross margin of 64.4%, down 70 basis points and in line with our expectations. This included a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID related costs and a favorable foreign currency impact of 20 basis points. Excluding COVID related costs, our gross margin finished on target with the original guidance we set at the start of the year. We are clearly seeing the benefit from our increased capacity and strengthen global manufacturing capabilities as we scale to meet growing global demand for Omnipod. We are also seeing the mix benefit from Omnipod DASH sold through the U.S. pharmacy channel. For the full year, we achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%, up from 15%, exceeding our guide due to timing of spend. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended 2020 with $962 million in cash and investments. Our sound financial position gives us flexibility to continue to invest in support of our long-term growth strategy. Now, turning to our outlook for 2021, our foundation for long-term, sustainable growth and value creation is clear. Although we will still be dealing with the global pandemic\u2019s effect on new customer starts from 2020 and into 2021. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 21%, and total company revenue growth of 15% to 20%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21% to 25%. This will be driven by volume growth of Omnipod DASH, aided by our increased investment in awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy with a mix benefit, expanded access and Omnipod adoption in the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. We will also benefit from the limited commercial launch of Omnipod 5 as we begin to ramp in the second half of the year. We expect full year 2021 International Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, driven by further growth in our current and new markets. This will be offset in part by the expected persistence of the global pandemic in Europe as well as the compounding impact of lower customer starts from 2020. While we are encouraged that new customer starts improved as we exited 2020, the recent impact of COVID has been felt more strongly in Europe than the U.S. Lastly, we expect drug delivery to be in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase based on our partner\u2019s current forecast. Looking now at gross margin, for full year 2021, we continue to expect to achieve our stated gross margin target of 67% to 70%. This expansion will be driven by global Omnipod volume growth, positive mix from the U.S. moving into the pharmacy and benefits from our enhanced manufacturing operations. Our teams continue to build efficiencies and scale into our manufacturing operations. We currently have two lines producing sellable product today and expect our third line to begin sellable production this year. In addition, our second contract manufacturer in China is an extension of our capabilities in that region, increasing our capacity and redundancy while balancing volume between the two sites. We are in a solid position to drive margin expansion this year. During 2021, we expect our operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth, as we continue to invest and build upon our differentiated consumer-focused innovation and position in the large and underpenetrated Type 1 and Type 2 markets. One item to note is that as we mature as a company, and shift from developing Omnipod 5 to marketing and expanding access to the product. Certain clinical trial efforts will shift to support our commercial strategy. Other R&D activities will see a similar shift. As a result, we estimate approximately $15 million of costs will shift from R&D to SG&A in 2021. We expect 2021 operating margin to be in the low double digits range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. This balances our continued investment for growth with strengthening our financial profile. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021, primarily due to continued investments in manufacturing operations and expanded manufacturing capacity to support our fast-paced growth and the launch of Omnipod 5, as well as some carryover of expenditures from last year. Turning to first quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 20% to 24%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 16% to 19%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 20% to 23% and international Omnipod revenue growth of 9% to 12%, reflecting the carryover headwind of lower global new customer starts in 2020 related to the pandemic as well as a continued impact on 2021, primarily internationally. We also expect drug delivery revenue of $18 million to $20 million. In conclusion, we are proud of how our team persevered in 2020. We delivered over 20% revenue growth, advanced our strategic imperatives and remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in a few months. The unmet need in the diabetes market is extraordinary, and we expect Omnipod to further replace legacy therapies as we continue to grow our addressable market. Our priorities are clear. We expect the investments we are making and the capabilities we are building will drive sustainable, long-term growth and create long-term value for shareholders and allow us to deliver a strong pipeline of future innovations to the diabetes community. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon, guys and congratulations on nice end to the year here. So I guess, just one for me on the rollout of Omnipod 5. Shacey, what is a limited launch mean? Who is going to have access and who all have access and how is that going to evolve through the course of 2021? Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. And I did want to share in Q&A that we are under review now and that\u2019s part of what gives us great confidence in the launch into limited market release in the first quarter. Collaboration has been great and engaged on behalf of the agency. So, as we move into limited market release, we are looking to test a few things. So, the primary governor, as I said in my opening remarks, is going to be access. We have to establish broad access in the pharmacy channel. That work is underway, but will take us time to scale and so that\u2019s going to be the governor primarily. But what we will be looking for in limited market release, just in terms of indicators that it\u2019s successful and that we are ready to continue to expand as market access expands is we will be looking qualitatively just to understand the customer experience, the training experience and the access experience for people who are coming on to the product for multiple daily injections, for our existing users that are transitioning on to the product and for tube pump users that are transitioning on to the product. So we are just going to want it test that all of our systems, our training, our clinical support are going as we expect them to and the product experience is going as we expected to in each of those groups. As we validate that and as we establish access, that\u2019s what we will have us expand through the rest of this year and into full market launch either later this year or early next. We can move on to the next question. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on a great quarter. I am going to squeeze in two into my one here. One, Shacey, I was coming at that 40% growth number over third quarter was fantastic. I am coming out for the year at something a little over 51,000 new patient adds 52,000. I just want to make sure that\u2019s the right ballpark. And then Wayde, as you look at cadence through the year, what are you assuming for new patient growth from Omnipod 5 and how are you expecting that to impact the cadence throughout 2021? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Wayde, do you want to take that?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Sure, I can start it, Robbie. Thanks for the question and you are right, we were very happy to see the sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. The pandemic certainly impacted us in the middle of the year, even in the U.S. and just as importantly, international to see it. Actually, Q4 was the first quarter that we saw improve new customer starts in both regions over prior year 2019 and 2019 was a really tough comp. We had record-breaking new customer starts in 2019, so absolutely right. That sequential improvement was important for us to see. We are not going to comment on specific numbers of customers, but as we shared in our earnings release, we now have 250,000 global customers. So, it\u2019s a good data point, I think for you. And then on new patient start growth for Omnipod 5, as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, it will be a limited release. And so there is a lot of scenarios running on that one. It really depends on what point in the year we get it launched here in the first half and then how we ramp. And as Shacey said, we are going to be monitoring a lot of things. We want to do a great job of both the user experience as well as developing access. And so again, just like Shacey said, it\u2019s those two things that will be pacing the ramp up over time and none of that diminishes our excitement around getting Omnipod 5 into the market next year. We have had just an immense interest from customers and our teams are and have been gearing up to launch Omnipod 5 for a couple of years now. So, lot of momentum, lot of excitement building, but we want to keep ourselves in check to make sure that we have the most successful launch we can. And part of that is limiting the ramp as we move through the end of the first half and into the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon. A lot of things I would like to ask, but let me just focus, I guess, on longer term if I could and Wayde, maybe a two parter for you. I know you just gave 2021 guidance and still dealing with some COVID uncertainties. But for the past few years, we have kind of had that guiding light out there with your 5-year plan that you are calling for $1 billion in revenue by this year and mid-teens operating margins as well by this year. It looks like you are going to deliver revenue above that guidance this year, margins maybe fall short a bit for all the Omnipod 5 investment reasons you have talked about. But is there anyway to help us think about maybe the next 3 to 5 years again kind of give us a guiding light there even if you are not going to officially kind of comment on 5-year outlook? Can revenue growth sustain above 20% over the longer term here, intermediate to longer term and do margins start to expand again once we get through this heavy investment period in 2021? Do we think about margin expansion then going forward in \u201822/23 things like that? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Thanks for your question, Jeff and we are spending a lot of time on it ourselves as well. I went through a robust long-term strategic planning session here. But we are not going to provide long-range planned guidance update until we get to the other side of Omnipod 5. It is a real pivotal launch for the company. And we are excited about what it can deliver. So we are pacing ourselves for an update to the long-range plan until we get a few quarters under our belt with Omnipod 5 and then we will be updating from there. You highlighted a few important things to the story though, which include the guidance here in 2021, which we feel is really strong, particularly for the U.S., 21% to 25% guidance for U.S. and less in international because we do see the pandemic headwinds persisting internationally more. We have covered a lot on our revenue guide in the prepared remarks. I think gross margin is pretty well understood at 67% to 70% in 2021. And there is going to be some phasing to that. We should expect Q1 to be below 67%, and then we will build into the range as we go through the year. There is quite a few drivers that will dictate whether we end up at the low end of that 67% to 70% range or at the high end. If we don\u2019t make 70% this year, we are committed to getting to 70% over time. So I think that was a part of your question, Jeff. As we think about gross margins, they are a key component of our financial thesis and we are confident that we will get to 70% over time. And then you mentioned the bottom line as well. We have a very strong operating margin guide here for 2021 in the low double-digits. That\u2019s a significant step up from 2020, but we should not assume the same step up beyond 2021. That is one area, while we have not guided to \u201822 and beyond, we want to make sure that everyone understands our investment thesis here, is to continue to invest to capitalize on our differentiated position in this very large unpenetrated market, both Type 1 and Type 2 markets. So you should inspect us to continue to invest heavily beyond 2021, in particular, in R&D and innovation, clinical, selling and marketing. We are going to be driving efficiencies as we scale in G&A and support functions. And so that will help us, along with the gross margin expansion to build a strengthening financial profile over time. But just to come back directly to your question, Jeff, I think we will continue to tick operating margin up annually, probably more like 1%, but not stepping it up every year like we are this year from \u201820 to \u201821. So we are not giving specific operating margin guidance for the future years, but I did want to make sure everyone fully understands our investment thesis here and that we are balancing our continued investments with our strengthening financial profile over time. So, thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a kind of nice quarter. Wayde, just want to come back to the Omnipod guidance globally, I mean the U.S. number, I think is a little stronger than people were expecting and obviously, the ex-U.S. number a little weaker based on the commentary you discussed in terms of European recovery, but we did see European recovery or European business in absolute dollars get better the last two quarters sequentially your guidance implies that will take a step back for the first time in the first quarter, sort of down 1Q versus 4Q. So just beyond what you\u2019re seeing in terms of resurgence is there anything going on from a competitive perspective, 780G, Control-IQ, what have you? Because it just seems that you were seeing some improvement in Europe in the first quarter guide and the \u201822 guide \u2013 sorry, the \u201821 guide sort of doesn\u2019t suggest that continues. So if you could flush it out, that would be great. Thanks so much.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Good question, David. Thanks. And we spend a lot of time on this because, as you know, and a lot of companies are challenged with really trying to peg guidance, and in fact, a lot of companies aren\u2019t guiding for this specific reason. The pandemic is tough to peg, obviously, more difficult outside the U.S., at least for us. We saw a pretty significant step-up and improvement in the U.S. as we\u2019ve progressed through the year. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re only 10% off of our beginning of your expectations in Q4. The U.S. was on the better side of that. So almost back to our beginning of year expectations, and it was a record-breaking quarter for us ever. And so a lot of confidence in that U.S. guide. And like you said, it\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s a strong guide. At both the high end and the low end, it will be higher growth dollars than it was in all of 2020. International, as you mentioned, David, it is feeling more of the compounding effect of our annuity model. So because the new customer starts were heavier impacted internationally in the last three quarters of 2020, it\u2019s going to feel it more in the first half of 2021. And then unlike the U.S., we\u2019re anticipating further pandemic impacts, the pandemic persisting into the first half of 2021 internationally. So that continues to compound into the numbers. So it is quite dramatic. Having said that, we have got a lot of momentum in our international business too, we have got the DASH rollout across all our new \u2013 all the regions internationally. We\u2019ve got 7 new countries. We\u2019re making investments in sales force expansion, we\u2019re also investing in marketing and direct-to-consumer pilots there as well. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to still guide to pretty strong double digits, 10% to 15%, in the face of a challenging pandemic environment internationally. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with at this point of the year here at the start and happy to be providing guidance and insights for you all. And we will certainly track it as we go throughout the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick one for me. The recent milestone of 250,000 users, I guess, how recent? Was that a 2020 event or 2021 and just has there been any changes in the attrition or retention, however you want to frame it? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Jayson, yes, we are thrilled to be celebrating the milestone of 0.25 million users relying on Omnipod. It\u2019s really exciting for the organization. That\u2019s a recently-hit milestone. Obviously, it\u2019s all estimates. So I always want to of predicate it with that, but that was a 2021 event. And there have not been changes in attrition or utilization. Those have really remained steady. That\u2019s terrific, actually because, obviously, as we anticipated the impact of the pandemic, we did anticipate that potentially, attrition could tick up we didn\u2019t see that. And that\u2019s part of the driver behind the really strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic. So that\u2019s great news on the business model and just the customer loyalty.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lin from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChris Lin: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe one on Tidepool. It seems like Tidepool, could receive FDA approval eminently. I was curious if you have any commercialization plans for Omnipod and the Loop algorithm upon launch? And how this could impact your thinking Omnipod with iPhone? And more specifically, do you have anything factored into 2021 revenue guidance related to this product? Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris, our partnership with Tidepool has primarily been a clinical and product development one. So we\u2019ve been supporting their regulatory submission and their development work. We don\u2019t have a commercial agreement at this point with Tidepool. So that\u2019s still to be worked out. I will say it\u2019s a tremendous undertaking to do that. So there is still a lot of work ahead of us. But that said, we do \u2013 we have said that we are working under way or we have work underway here with Omnipod 5 on the iOS platform. So I think it remains to be seen who\u2019s going to hit the market first with iOS, and we\u2019re certainly really excited about Omnipod 5. That remains our priority at this point. And we\u2019ll continue to support Tidepool\u2019s efforts in terms of their submission and their development.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening and thank you for taking the question. I was curious about the 35% to 40% Type 2 metric. That seems to be a nice step-up sequentially. And I\u2019m just curious if some of your DTC campaigning is heading towards that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing that or if it\u2019s just sort of a natural development of the market?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks, Joanne, yes, we\u2019re really excited about just the continued in the Type 2 segment. It\u2019s just a group of users that have responded so well to the simplicity of DASH and some of the product benefits. I would say two things driving that. And one, as you know, is just increased awareness so that there are obviously a lot of people in the United States. We estimate over 2 million people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes who can benefit from the product. And so advertising as part of what\u2019s unlocking that. The other thing is you saw the step-up in increased access. And as we drive more availability in the pharmacy, this really differentiated business model that allows people to access it with such an affordable under $50 a month in out-of-pocket costs. That is in line with the cost of multiple daily injections for example. So it is incredibly affordable broad access that doesn\u2019t have the constraints that exist in other channels for the Type 2 segment. And that\u2019s sort of been our strategy really. We believe as we drive more simplicity into the product, we establish broader and affordable access to the tune of access in line with the cost of multiple daily injections. That\u2019s how we bring our technology to millions of patients, not just hundreds of thousands of patients. And so we\u2019re excited to see that. And I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s been driving the Type 2 adoption and growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups on the Type 2s to Joanne\u2019s point. So can you guys give us a sense of how big Type 2s are as a percentage of the installed base what percent maybe have coverage under pharmacy? Is it close to that 75% that you referenced on the call for the Type 1 patients? And then anything around utilization for these Type 2 patients, given they are in some insulin needs versus a Type 1?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes, I\u2019ll start, and then Wayde may have some color to add. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility. I\u2019ll explain why. As we drive more utilization into the pharmacy channel, we have less visibility at this point to diagnosis at coverage. And so that is a little bit of a challenge for us because, obviously, all of our Medicare reimbursement is through the pharmacy channel. And 40% of people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes are over the age of 50 or 60. And so you can imagine that there is a lot of overlap behind our Medicare coverage in the pharmacy channel and the Type 2 segment. In terms of access, 75% is a number for all commercial coverage. There actually isn\u2019t a distinction in the pharmacy channel between Type 1 and Type 2 coverage. So that number is good for both segments. And given the progress we\u2019ve made, particularly in Medicare Access, coverage is very strong and probably at $0 out-of-pocket for the Medicare user. So it\u2019s a really affordable, really broad access for the Type 2 user in the pharmacy channel, particularly for the Medicare Type 2 user. So I think all of that is contributing to the growth. And unfortunately, we don\u2019t have an updated total base number from what we gave a few years ago because we\u2019ve been driving so much growth into the pharmacy channel. This is great for users, great for payers and great for us. But right now comes with a bit of a visibility challenge.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Karen on for Matt. We were hoping you could provide an update on the iPhone compatibility for Omnipod 5, do you think that will come later this year or will that be more of a 2022 event? And with over half of the population having an iPhone, how are you making sure that isn\u2019t a limitation uptake?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. So we\u2019re not going to give an update on the timeline. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market, and then we can start updating time lines for all the innovations that will follow around additional sensor integrations and additional phone platforms. But I have said multiple times in the last couple of calls that this work is underway. So we have teams of very talented people working on iOS phone control. We don\u2019t envision this will be a limiting factor for two reasons. One is we will provide every user a back up PDM with SIM technology. This gives users a constant connectivity to data and all the benefits of Omnipod 5. And remember, you only need that PDM or your Samsung phone if you\u2019re using phone control to pair a pod and to announce a meal. Otherwise, and for every 3 days when you time a pod. But otherwise, you can remain in automated mode in closed-loop because of the algorithm on the pod without your phone or your PDM, and all of your data is able to be viewed via our apps on your iPhone. So you\u2019re still going to get all of that visibility and ease of use through our apps on your iPhone. So we think it\u2019s going to be a great user experience for Apple users, and we\u2019re working very hard to get them full phone control as quickly as possible, and we\u2019ll update once we get to market with Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Hi, thank you. A quick one for Shacey and quick one for Wayde. One would be on the preschool opportunity for Omnipod 5? And can you quantify how large that opportunity is? And maybe characterize the demand among parents to get preschoolers on an automated solution? And a quick one for Wayde would be on the automated U.S. and China lines when those reach scale, how would you quantify the gross margin tailwind? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Anthony, I don\u2019t have a size for the preschool segment. This is a smaller segment, so ages 2 to 6. But I can tell you it\u2019s an outsized importance segments, both in terms of the value of the technology to this group as well as the value of this group to Insulet. Today, we are the market leader in pediatrics. We see our ability to maintain and expand that segment. You think about the benefits of Omnipod for this segment, the ease of use and the discretion for young active children versus small active children having to contend with 3 to 4 feet of tubing and a large device, it\u2019s a particularly differentiated technology today without CGM integration and automated insulin delivery. And when we combine that for this group, it\u2019s going to be incredibly powerful. So we know, based on the response and the feedback from our trial participants, and I think the strong indicator that 100% of users completed the trial and moved on to the extension phase, all really important indicators that we\u2019re going to have a winning product in this population.\nWayde McMillan: Great. Thanks for the question on the operations strategy as well. Anthony, it\u2019s critical to our overall strategy, given that we want to make sure that we not only have capacity but also quality products and redundancy across the globe to make sure we can continue servicing our customers. And so along your question, from the automated lines in the U.S., we have two producing now and a third line installed that will be producing salable product on this year. So that more than doubles the capacity in our legacy China facility. And then you referenced the other China lines, which is the fact that we stood up a second third-party manufacturer in China during 2020, which also doubles our capacity out of our legacy facility. So, all of that together gives us significant capacity increase as well as the ability to balance it between the facilities. And that redundancy is important for us. The gross margin tailwind, it is the single largest driver, actually, of our gross margin improvement over time. As we begin to put more volume through all the plants, we scale more efficiently but in particular, our U.S. manufacturing facility that is automated and has mostly fixed costs limited variable costs. The more volume we put through there will become the most efficient plant that we have and so that will be a gross margin tailwind for us. So, all of the operations strategies are designed, number one, to get good quality product, a reliable product to our customers and also drive gross margin favorability for us.\nOperator: Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So question I had was you mentioned avid working on these sensor integration. So I was hoping you could just flesh that out a bit more and talk about the partnership and the timing there to any extent that you can?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Matt. We\u2019re excited to be partnered with Abbott. Their product has been particularly adopted in international markets. There are certain countries where they are a dominant shareholder. And as they continue to drive ease of use and awareness, they are a terrific partner for us. As I mentioned, we won\u2019t be giving updated time lines until we get our current generation with DexCom out into the market. We\u2019re very excited about the value that, that\u2019s going to drive. But both sensor partners, DexCom and Abbott, are driving, they are transforming the market. They are bringing real-time insights to users. And that adoption is helping to fuel Omnipod adoption. And so both are very important to us. And we see the potential to bring a long line of innovations with our partnerships with both DexCom and Abbott. So we are working on that. Just like iOS, we have had teams of people focused on that integration, and that work is underway and excited to update the market after we get Omnipod 5 to the market.\nOperator: Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Mathew Blackman from Stifel. Please go ahead. \nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for the question. Just thinking ahead to the ENDO meeting next month, looking at some of the early abstracts posted on the meeting website. It looks like beyond the pivotal study, there is also a presentation from Dr. Bode looking at Omnipod 5 in Type 2 patients. Can you just remind us what that study is and how it relates to or even helped inform the larger Type 2 study you just started to enroll? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So Dr. Bode will be presenting some early results from our feasibility study in Type 2. So if you remember, we had mentioned on the last call that we had launched our feasibility work. And I mentioned in my remarks today that, that continues, enrollment continues. That research is going very well. We expect, and we are learning great things regarding the Type 2 segment. And so from those learnings, we will then enter into a larger pivotal study, which will then drive expansion in indications and the label for Omnipod 5. So that is what will play out over the coming months and potentially, a year or longer. We haven\u2019t given a timeline on that. But Dr. Bode will be sharing his experience and his research with Omnipod 5 in the Type 2 segment. We believe that our technology can bring tremendous value to this segment to drive improved outcomes, certainly and tremendous ease of use. And so we are committed to doing the research, and he\u2019s been a great partner with us on that front.\nOperator: Thank you. So our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I think I heard you say this, Shacey, in the prepared remarks. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounded like you\u2019ll be launching O5 or the Omnipod 5 only in the pharmacy channel. So I guess question one, is that correct? And then two, it sounded like access is going to be one of the more important drivers during the limited launch. So maybe just help us think about the time line to getting broader access in the pharmacy channel for Omnipod 5 and maybe some of the conversations you\u2019ve had with payers that have driven your decision to go solely on the pharmacy side?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Kyle, you heard that correct that we will be launching Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel, and we will be launching at price parity. So that was a very thoughtful decision that we\u2019ve made. And the goal behind that is really just to drive more rapid access and more affordable access. And so what this means, it\u2019s actually really exciting because what this means is, today, as I mentioned earlier, a DASH user pays less than $50 a month on average for the technology, we\u2019re going to be able to bring our remarkable and advanced technology in Omnipod 5 for the same type of co-pay for users. I mean, in line with MDI for many users. So that is really exciting, and we think the right thing to do to truly unlock this population. It\u2019s a great channel for payers, a great channel for patients and a great channel for Insulet. We are driving into the pharmacy channel because of all of the benefits that we\u2019ve talked about, and we view Omnipod 5 as an opportunity to bring more users into that channel, which has great benefits for payers and for patients, frankly. So \u2013 and you are right that access will be the primary governor. I think back to DASH, we established \u2013 it took us about 2 years to establish broad access, where we are in the 70% plus range with DASH. And I would expect, if you think about what we were doing with DASH, we were also launching a new business model and establishing the channel, so, all of our partnerships and IT integrations with wholesalers and pharmacies. All of that work is now transferable and there and established for Omnipod 5. Our conversations are underway with payers and making good progress. And so we do expect that we will establish access more rapidly than DASH. But at this point, I think that\u2019s the primary performance indicator that we will be updating all of you on is just how we\u2019re doing with covered lives because that\u2019s going to be the primary driver of our success as we move through the limited market release.\nOperator: Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Shamcey, on Omnipod 5 for new potential customers interested in getting it who can\u2019t yet as you ramp pharmacy access, is there any reason for them to hold off or is it \u2013 will it be pretty seamless for someone moving from DASH to Omnipod 5 PDM? Any thoughts on how that transition from DASH to Omnipod 5 will work for customers that would be great?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. No reason for them to hold off. In fact, there may be reasons for them to get on, and I\u2019ll explain that. And when we think about the training pathways, the user interface with DASH is sort of the foundation and the user experience is the foundation for Omnipod 5 and so the training is likely to be much more streamlined for somebody who is moving from, for example, Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. And so it may just help you speed up if you get onto Omnipod DASH, as you\u2019re headed to Omnipod 5, but certainly no reason to hold off. As we said, we are not going to be charging any upfront conversion fee. Anybody, frankly, who is using any technology, whether that is Omnipod DASH, whether that is legacy Omnipod or MDI or a tube pump. As soon as we have pharmacy access established for them, they should be able to get on to the product with no upfront fee and very reasonable out-of-pocket costs. And we\u2019ve worked really hard to kind of conceive of and deploy that strategy to help bring our technology to more people more rapidly.\nSteven Lichtman: Thanks, Shacey.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Please go ahead. \nRavi Misra: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, we got you.\nRavi Misra: Hey, great. Thanks. So I just wanted to \u2013 sorry if I asked, if this has been asked, I\u2019m jumping between calls. But just on the Type 2 kind of commentary that you\u2019ve been seeing, very strong adoption, very impressive in my view. Just from \u2013 can you help understand kind of what \u2013 it seems like there is a little bit of a kind of victorious circle or going on here between CGM adoption and Type 2 in pump adoption. Can you kind of maybe help tease out some of the dynamics there in terms of as access is getting easier for both? Is it kind of your kind of technology that\u2019s leading more people to get on to CGM, therefore, creating a virtuous cycle there or is it CGM usage that\u2019s kind of bringing your guys into there? And then maybe layering on how we think about the Abbott product and the work that you may be doing with them in this Type 2 segment? Thanks. \nShacey Petrovic: Sure. I think all great observations there. There are, in my view, three things that are driving Type 2 adoption for Omnipod. And the first is we have the right business model in the right channel for Type 2 users. So the fact that we can provide this very affordable, broad access with very few constraints as part of what is driving adoption. The second is just increasing awareness of the simplicity of our technology, and that\u2019s coming through our efforts on both the sales and marketing front. And the third is CGM adoption. And this is actually a really important dynamic for us. As we think about not just 2021, but the next several years. What the CGM companies have done is really dramatically displace blood glucose monitoring in the Type 1 population. And now they have their sites set on the Type 2 population. And we\u2019ve been benefiting significantly from that conversion as patients, first in Type 1 and now more significantly, in Type 2. As these users get visibility to their data and how little time they are spending in range, they are looking for tools like Omnipod to help get them in range, and they are also comfortable wearing something because CGM has gotten them over that psychological barrier. So all three of those things are helping to drive our success in Type 2, and I think the technology is really well suited. So as we see progress and further advancement in adoption of CGM, this is a great trend for us in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on a pretty stellar year given the environment actually regardless of the environment. Shacey, question for you on Type 2 and how we should think about just echoing everyone\u2019s sentiment. I mean you\u2019ve done so well there. But what should we be thinking from an ultimate penetration perspective for insulin-dependent Type 2 patients? I mean is this a patient population given the barriers that you guys have broken down you think could reach close to \u2013 or maybe let\u2019s put it, standard of care versus MDIs or is there some different way to that this patient population manages their disease that they just might not be relevant per pump, the majority of them? Can you help us understand what you are thinking for ultimate penetration? Sorry, that was really long.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes, sure. I think I won\u2019t comment on ultimate penetration because I just think it\u2019s going to take time with this segment. We\u2019re just in really early days here relative to the Type 1 segment. So we\u2019re more comfortable saying, hey, Type 1s can get over 50% because we\u2019re mature and we\u2019re \u2013 we see where we are in that adoption curve. We\u2019re standing on the precipice with Type 2s, and we\u2019re seeing great adoption, but it\u2019s very small penetration into this massive opportunity. When you think about the intensively managed Type 2 user, there really isn\u2019t much different in their need. And we do think that all of the work we\u2019re doing to establish broad, affordable access to drive unparalleled simplicity into our technologies that those advantages are, I would argue, more important for the Type 2 user than the Type 1 user. But regardless, they are important for all of our users and should drive continued adoption. And we see both segments, Type 1, particularly as we start \u2013 as we bring Omnipod 5 to market, we think that will be an accelerator for growth in the marketplace. And then as we look at Type 2, we\u2019ve got a product today that is incredibly simple and being very enthusiastic embraced. And then as we \u2013 kind of the next wave is as we bring the simplicity of Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 market, we think that can further unlock it. So we\u2019re excited about the long-term prospects for the Type 2 space.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic.\nShacey Petrovic: Thank you. I wanted to share that recently one of our Omnipod 5 principal investigators for our pivotal study, Dr. Desalvo, from Baylor, he shared his feedback on Omnipod 5 with us. And what he said was to, not only have you achieved outstanding clinical results, but the diabetes burden has been ameliorated. And the satisfaction is unlike anything I have experienced before, especially for caregivers. It\u2019s clear that this is about the patients and their families. And he is right it is about our customers and their families. This is what gets us going every single day. We are so proud of the progress we\u2019ve made. We\u2019re now changing the lives of 0.25 million people across the globe, and we\u2019re not going to stop there. Insulet and our customers\u2019 days \u2013 best days are still ahead. So thank you very much. Have a great evening. We will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Shacey. Our fourth quarter results completed another year of solid growth and execution. Although challenged with the pandemic through 2020, we entered 2021 with positive momentum. This past year, we meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives. Our focus to invest for accelerated revenue growth and expand margins while strengthening our financial profile will continue to drive significant value for all of our stakeholders and further our mission. In the fourth quarter, we delivered over 15% revenue growth, $9 million above our guidance range. The key driver of this outperformance was total Omnipod growth of 18%, which was $8 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery also finished slightly ahead of expectations by $1 million. While the pandemic was less of a headwind than initially estimated, it negatively impacted global new customer starts throughout 2020, largely beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, this dynamic created a compounding impact on revenue in the second half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect the impact to revenue will continue in 2021, although to a lessening degree. In the fourth quarter, the impact on new customer starts was more favorable than estimated in both the U.S. and international regions, with a combined effect of approximately 10% off of our beginning-of-the-year expectations. We were encouraged to see continued sequential improvements as we added almost 40% more global new customers in Q4 than we did in Q3. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 18% in the fourth quarter. Our solid top line performance was driven by our growing customer base, increased Omnipod DASH adoption and the continued mix benefit as we shift into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove over 65% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 35% of our total U.S. volume. This represents a continued increase in adoption of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. Moving forward, shifting our business model to the pharmacy remains a key priority as it reduces barriers and drives expanded access for Omnipod is more efficient for our customers, provides low, more predictable out-of-pocket costs and is easier to prescribe for physicians. Not to mention the number of benefits for payers. International on Omnipod revenue also grew 18%, driven by a growing customer base and more favorable performance in Europe than expected. Despite COVID related shutdowns in many European countries. Global attrition and utilization were again stable in the quarter. Drug delivery revenue decreased 11% due to timing of production. Gross margin was 65.5% in the fourth quarter, representing a 150 basis point increase, in line with our expectations. Our gross margin expansion continues to be driven primarily by our improved U.S. manufacturing operations as we further ramp our new automated lines as well as the ongoing benefit of volume mix shift into the pharmacy channel. Foreign currency was a 70 basis point tailwind, partially offset by a 40 basis point headwind from COVID related safety and mitigation costs. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were above our expectations due to a $15 million charge related to the resolution of a contingency payment we disclosed the positive resolution in late December, and we're pleased to have reached favorable terms with our former European distributor and within our estimated range. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were in line with our expectations, including a stock award to all employees for their execution in a very challenging environment, as well as to mark our 20th anniversary as a company. As a result, we incurred a $7 million expense relating to a one-time equity bonus. This grant also serves as a way for our employees to be more invested in our company and our future, especially as we enter an exciting new phase with the launch of Omnipod 5 this charge was offset somewhat by lower R&D and selling and marketing expenses due to timing of projects, which we now expect will occur in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 14% in Q4, down from 17% in the prior year. We continue to invest throughout our business, including increases in advertising and brand awareness, innovation as well as scaling our global business to support our growth. For the full year, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 23% and total company revenue growth of 22%, achieving another record year and further illustrating the strength and durability of our annuity revenue model. In 2020, we achieved gross margin of 64.4%, down 70 basis points and in line with our expectations. This included a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID related costs and a favorable foreign currency impact of 20 basis points. Excluding COVID related costs, our gross margin finished on target with the original guidance we set at the start of the year. We are clearly seeing the benefit from our increased capacity and strengthen global manufacturing capabilities as we scale to meet growing global demand for Omnipod. We are also seeing the mix benefit from Omnipod DASH sold through the U.S. pharmacy channel. For the full year, we achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%, up from 15%, exceeding our guide due to timing of spend. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended 2020 with $962 million in cash and investments. Our sound financial position gives us flexibility to continue to invest in support of our long-term growth strategy. Now, turning to our outlook for 2021, our foundation for long-term, sustainable growth and value creation is clear. Although we will still be dealing with the global pandemic's effect on new customer starts from 2020 and into 2021. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 21%, and total company revenue growth of 15% to 20%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21% to 25%. This will be driven by volume growth of Omnipod DASH, aided by our increased investment in awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy with a mix benefit, expanded access and Omnipod adoption in the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. We will also benefit from the limited commercial launch of Omnipod 5 as we begin to ramp in the second half of the year. We expect full year 2021 International Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, driven by further growth in our current and new markets. This will be offset in part by the expected persistence of the global pandemic in Europe as well as the compounding impact of lower customer starts from 2020. While we are encouraged that new customer starts improved as we exited 2020, the recent impact of COVID has been felt more strongly in Europe than the U.S. Lastly, we expect drug delivery to be in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase based on our partner's current forecast. Looking now at gross margin, for full year 2021, we continue to expect to achieve our stated gross margin target of 67% to 70%. This expansion will be driven by global Omnipod volume growth, positive mix from the U.S. moving into the pharmacy and benefits from our enhanced manufacturing operations. Our teams continue to build efficiencies and scale into our manufacturing operations. We currently have two lines producing sellable product today and expect our third line to begin sellable production this year. In addition, our second contract manufacturer in China is an extension of our capabilities in that region, increasing our capacity and redundancy while balancing volume between the two sites. We are in a solid position to drive margin expansion this year. During 2021, we expect our operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth, as we continue to invest and build upon our differentiated consumer-focused innovation and position in the large and underpenetrated Type 1 and Type 2 markets. One item to note is that as we mature as a company, and shift from developing Omnipod 5 to marketing and expanding access to the product. Certain clinical trial efforts will shift to support our commercial strategy. Other R&D activities will see a similar shift. As a result, we estimate approximately $15 million of costs will shift from R&D to SG&A in 2021. We expect 2021 operating margin to be in the low double digits range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. This balances our continued investment for growth with strengthening our financial profile. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021, primarily due to continued investments in manufacturing operations and expanded manufacturing capacity to support our fast-paced growth and the launch of Omnipod 5, as well as some carryover of expenditures from last year. Turning to first quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 20% to 24%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 16% to 19%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 20% to 23% and international Omnipod revenue growth of 9% to 12%, reflecting the carryover headwind of lower global new customer starts in 2020 related to the pandemic as well as a continued impact on 2021, primarily internationally. We also expect drug delivery revenue of $18 million to $20 million. In conclusion, we are proud of how our team persevered in 2020. We delivered over 20% revenue growth, advanced our strategic imperatives and remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in a few months. The unmet need in the diabetes market is extraordinary, and we expect Omnipod to further replace legacy therapies as we continue to grow our addressable market. Our priorities are clear. We expect the investments we are making and the capabilities we are building will drive sustainable, long-term growth and create long-term value for shareholders and allow us to deliver a strong pipeline of future innovations to the diabetes community. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. Sure, I can start it, Robbie. Thanks for the question and you are right, we were very happy to see the sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. The pandemic certainly impacted us in the middle of the year, even in the U.S. and just as importantly, international to see it. Actually, Q4 was the first quarter that we saw improve new customer starts in both regions over prior year 2019 and 2019 was a really tough comp. We had record-breaking new customer starts in 2019, so absolutely right. That sequential improvement was important for us to see. We are not going to comment on specific numbers of customers, but as we shared in our earnings release, we now have 250,000 global customers. So, it's a good data point, I think for you. And then on new patient start growth for Omnipod 5, as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, it will be a limited release. And so there is a lot of scenarios running on that one. It really depends on what point in the year we get it launched here in the first half and then how we ramp. And as Shacey said, we are going to be monitoring a lot of things. We want to do a great job of both the user experience as well as developing access. And so again, just like Shacey said, it's those two things that will be pacing the ramp up over time and none of that diminishes our excitement around getting Omnipod 5 into the market next year. We have had just an immense interest from customers and our teams are and have been gearing up to launch Omnipod 5 for a couple of years now. So, lot of momentum, lot of excitement building, but we want to keep ourselves in check to make sure that we have the most successful launch we can. And part of that is limiting the ramp as we move through the end of the first half and into the second half of the year. Yes. Thanks for your question, Jeff and we are spending a lot of time on it ourselves as well. I went through a robust long-term strategic planning session here. But we are not going to provide long-range planned guidance update until we get to the other side of Omnipod 5. It is a real pivotal launch for the company. And we are excited about what it can deliver. So we are pacing ourselves for an update to the long-range plan until we get a few quarters under our belt with Omnipod 5 and then we will be updating from there. You highlighted a few important things to the story though, which include the guidance here in 2021, which we feel is really strong, particularly for the U.S., 21% to 25% guidance for U.S. and less in international because we do see the pandemic headwinds persisting internationally more. We have covered a lot on our revenue guide in the prepared remarks. I think gross margin is pretty well understood at 67% to 70% in 2021. And there is going to be some phasing to that. We should expect Q1 to be below 67%, and then we will build into the range as we go through the year. There is quite a few drivers that will dictate whether we end up at the low end of that 67% to 70% range or at the high end. If we don't make 70% this year, we are committed to getting to 70% over time. So I think that was a part of your question, Jeff. As we think about gross margins, they are a key component of our financial thesis and we are confident that we will get to 70% over time. And then you mentioned the bottom line as well. We have a very strong operating margin guide here for 2021 in the low double-digits. That's a significant step up from 2020, but we should not assume the same step up beyond 2021. That is one area, while we have not guided to \u201822 and beyond, we want to make sure that everyone understands our investment thesis here, is to continue to invest to capitalize on our differentiated position in this very large unpenetrated market, both Type 1 and Type 2 markets. So you should inspect us to continue to invest heavily beyond 2021, in particular, in R&D and innovation, clinical, selling and marketing. We are going to be driving efficiencies as we scale in G&A and support functions. And so that will help us, along with the gross margin expansion to build a strengthening financial profile over time. But just to come back directly to your question, Jeff, I think we will continue to tick operating margin up annually, probably more like 1%, but not stepping it up every year like we are this year from \u201820 to \u201821. So we are not giving specific operating margin guidance for the future years, but I did want to make sure everyone fully understands our investment thesis here and that we are balancing our continued investments with our strengthening financial profile over time. So, thanks Jeff. Yes. Good question, David. Thanks. And we spend a lot of time on this because, as you know, and a lot of companies are challenged with really trying to peg guidance, and in fact, a lot of companies aren't guiding for this specific reason. The pandemic is tough to peg, obviously, more difficult outside the U.S., at least for us. We saw a pretty significant step-up and improvement in the U.S. as we've progressed through the year. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we're only 10% off of our beginning of your expectations in Q4. The U.S. was on the better side of that. So almost back to our beginning of year expectations, and it was a record-breaking quarter for us ever. And so a lot of confidence in that U.S. guide. And like you said, it's \u2013 we think it's a strong guide. At both the high end and the low end, it will be higher growth dollars than it was in all of 2020. International, as you mentioned, David, it is feeling more of the compounding effect of our annuity model. So because the new customer starts were heavier impacted internationally in the last three quarters of 2020, it's going to feel it more in the first half of 2021. And then unlike the U.S., we're anticipating further pandemic impacts, the pandemic persisting into the first half of 2021 internationally. So that continues to compound into the numbers. So it is quite dramatic. Having said that, we have got a lot of momentum in our international business too, we have got the DASH rollout across all our new \u2013 all the regions internationally. We've got 7 new countries. We're making investments in sales force expansion, we're also investing in marketing and direct-to-consumer pilots there as well. So that's what gives us the confidence to still guide to pretty strong double digits, 10% to 15%, in the face of a challenging pandemic environment internationally. So that's what we're comfortable with at this point of the year here at the start and happy to be providing guidance and insights for you all. And we will certainly track it as we go throughout the year. Great. Thanks for the question on the operations strategy as well. Anthony, it's critical to our overall strategy, given that we want to make sure that we not only have capacity but also quality products and redundancy across the globe to make sure we can continue servicing our customers. And so along your question, from the automated lines in the U.S., we have two producing now and a third line installed that will be producing salable product on this year. So that more than doubles the capacity in our legacy China facility. And then you referenced the other China lines, which is the fact that we stood up a second third-party manufacturer in China during 2020, which also doubles our capacity out of our legacy facility. So, all of that together gives us significant capacity increase as well as the ability to balance it between the facilities. And that redundancy is important for us. The gross margin tailwind, it is the single largest driver, actually, of our gross margin improvement over time. As we begin to put more volume through all the plants, we scale more efficiently but in particular, our U.S. manufacturing facility that is automated and has mostly fixed costs limited variable costs. The more volume we put through there will become the most efficient plant that we have and so that will be a gross margin tailwind for us. So, all of the operations strategies are designed, number one, to get good quality product, a reliable product to our customers and also drive gross margin favorability for us."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss our key accomplishments and our strategic priorities. Wayde will share our 2020 financial results and introduce our 2021 guidance. And then we will open the call for your questions. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to another very successful year for Insulet. In the face of extraordinary challenges, we executed our strategy, delivered consistently strong growth and advanced our key imperatives. This past year, more than any other, clearly demonstrated the loyalty of our customers, the durability of our pay-as-you-go model and the strong value proposition of our differentiated technology. What we have accomplished in 2020 is a clear indicator of the resiliency and strength of our people and our culture. Together, we embraced a new reality, while staying committed to our core mission we not only supported each other, but also our customers and the communities we serve. One of Insulet's greatest strengths is our mission-driven customer centric culture. This was particularly evident this past year as our team rose to the challenges and showed an incredible ability to learn, adapt and perform in an ambiguous and rapidly changing environment. We executed with an unwavering commitment to our customers and delivered another compelling year of growth. Our mission remains the same improve the lives of people with diabetes and every Insulet employee drives towards this goal with unmatched passion. In the face of COVID, we didn't miss a beat and we consistently advanced our innovation, commercial and operational initiatives. We entered 2021 with strong momentum with our Omnipod 5 commercial launch on track and expanding clinical and innovation pipeline and a growing global addressable market. In 2020, we delivered over 20% annual revenue growth for the fifth consecutive year, a remarkable achievement, given upended working conditions and market challenges. In fact, we finished 2020 ahead of our beginning of the year pre-COVID expectations. We achieved record annual and quarterly revenue for both our U.S. and international Omnipod product lines. We also completed the year with a fourth quarter record number of global new customers, driven by U.S. new customer starts that were higher than any quarter in Insulet's history. While we finished the year strong and overcame most of the pandemic's challenges, it certainly impacted our global new customer additions during 2020. As we look to 2021, this will serve as a slight headwind to revenue growth. Nevertheless, our financial performance has been impressive and our overall outlook remains strong. Let's turn to our strategic imperatives centered around expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. I will start with access and awareness and what we are doing to deliver the best customer experience. Our primary goal is simple, breakdown existing access barriers for Omnipod. There are far too many people living with diabetes that don't have access to or are unaware of Omnipod's many benefits compared to other therapies. Outcomes are being limited because access traditionally has been too complicated and too costly. Omnipod offers a simple, discrete form factor and an easy-to-use product platform that is unmatched. We provide our customers broad, affordable access and a simpler customer experience while making it easier to prescribe for physicians. Our new customer starts, industry leading retention and customer loyalty are clear indicators of the value Omnipod delivers. We continue to attract approximately 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. And in the fourth quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new Omnipod customers were Type 2, up from Q3. Our current system, Omnipod DASH, not only marked our move to mobile technology and represents the platform for our next generations, it also is powering our success, attracting both MDI users and individuals with Type 1 and Type 2, as well as expanding pharmacy access. By the end of the fourth quarter, we had secured coverage for approximately 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, up significantly from last quarter. Today, most of our new customers throughout the globe start on Omnipod DASH. While we remain focused on providing our customers easy access through our pay-as-you-go model and the U.S. pharmacy channel, we also continue to increase Omnipod awareness of the benefits we deliver to people living with diabetes. The diabetes market is dramatically underserved and increased Omnipod awareness is driving growth. Our recent direct-to-consumer advertising campaign has provided us with great insight. The reaction to our pilot and the early read of key leading indicators, have been positive. So we have decided to continue advertising to support our efforts. We look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year. Taking a step back, Omnipod adoption and retention have been incredibly strong despite not having a CGM integrated product in the marketplace. This year, that technological gap will not only be closed, it will be surpassed. We are thrilled to be on the verge of introducing our next evolution of consumer-focused innovation. We could not be more excited, and we know our customers and our future customers have been waiting for our transformative technology. Omnipod 5, our automated insulin delivery system in partnership with DexCom, is designed to deliver unmatched freedom for people living with diabetes and to greatly simplify insulin management and improve glucose control. We will be the first tubeless entirely wearable AID system with the algorithm on the pod. Other than a pod change every 3 days, there will be no need to disconnect or stop therapy. And the number one request from current and prospective customers is the ability to control the pod from a personal smartphone. Our system will be the first to provide full smartphone control. This means we can remove an entire component of the system, resulting in reduced burden and dramatically improved simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to provide our customers much more and to ask them to do much less. Omnipod 5 will first launch with control from Android mobile phones and all customers will receive a backup personal diabetes manager with SIM technology. This ensures constant connectivity to data even when not near a Wi-Fi and this allows for real-time remote monitoring. With Omnipod 5, parents will always know how their children are doing on our system. We have heard from many about how much of a relief it is to have confidence in Omnipod 5 to control glucose and be able to periodically monitor their children in real-time. As a result, trial participants have told us that their families are finally sleeping and that they are better parents and spouses since starting on Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is disruptive technology that we believe will revolutionize the market and the lives of people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are on track for a limited commercial launch in the United States in the first half of this year with pharmacy access and our pay-as-you-go model. Unlike other therapies, Omnipod 5 customers will not have to pay upfront, nor will they have an upgrade fee or be locked into a 4-year contract. Anyone with coverage, even existing tube pump users can try Omnipod at any time for free with our 30 days of freedom trial. Omnipod 5 will be offered at price parity with Omnipod DASH in the U.S. while we know our Aid system commands a premium, our focus is on securing broad payer coverage and customer access. Like Omnipod DASH, the majority of Omnipod 5 customers will have a pharmacy monthly co-pay of under $50. Pricing Omnipod 5 at the same level as Omnipod DASH will drive affordable coverage, accelerated customer adoption and is consistent with our efforts to eliminate barriers and broaden access. We anticipate we will be in a limited launch period for the majority of this year. This gives us time to secure broad pharmacy coverage since Omnipod 5 will be available in only this channel. We are confident Omnipod 5 will be a game changer for people living with diabetes and believe the primary driver of a broader commercial rollout will be consumer access. We have invested ahead to build our manufacturing and supply chain operations and are more than prepared to meet market demand. As we gear up for our highly anticipated launch, we continue to build clinical evidence to support many applications of Omnipod 5 as we believe our technology can provide enormous value to broad groups of patients within multiple markets and settings. We, therefore, will continue to heavily invest clinically and have a robust road map, including our ongoing work to expand our indication to preschoolers, ages 2 to 6. We recently completed our preschool pivotal study, and we are compiling the data for submission to the FDA. The study had 80 young children on product, and we are delighted to share that 100% have completed the trial and 100% have elected to continue into an extension phase. This is a clear indication of the value that Omnipod 5 can deliver for these young children. And we continue to plan for an expanded indication by the end of this year. Also, enrollment for our Type 2 feasibility study continues. Upon that study's completion, we plan to conduct additional studies with the goal to further expand Omnipod 5's indications. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, we look forward to presenting our Omnipod 5 pivotal data at the Endo conference next month. If our pre pivotal data is any indication, it should demonstrate just how powerful Omnipod 5 is for improved outcomes and improved quality of life. We are incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and a successful rollout remains our top priority. But we also continue to advance an innovation road map that extends well beyond our AID system. In fact, in 2020, we doubled the number of product development employees to support our robust road map, particularly in the areas of software development and data science. We are committed to investing in future innovations to deliver increased value to our customers for many years to come. We are working on innovation programs designed to drive unparalleled simplicity of our user interactions with our systems, improved outcomes through algorithm advancements, insights and value from our growing data sets and analytics and user choice of sensor and smartphone integrations. We are committed to integrating Omnipod 5 in our future generations with multiple CGM platforms, and are delighted to be partnering with DexCom and Abbott Libre in these efforts. Their CGM offerings are helping to drive increased Omnipod adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 segments. This is extremely beneficial as the global diabetes market remains critically underserved and far too many people remain uninformed about their treatment options. By working together, we expect to deliver a long line of innovative offerings that further improve the lives of millions of people around the globe. Now turning to global expansion, during the fourth quarter, we entered 5 new countries within Europe and the Middle East. Just this week, we expanded into Turkey and plan to launch in Australia later on this year. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are in a strong position to capitalize on this large addressable market, given our focus to provide simple and widespread access to Omnipod. A technology we know greatly simplifies lives and provides better outcomes and quality of life. We are expanding internationally in a targeted and strategic manner and are building our go-to-market plans to enter larger geographies over time. We expect our total addressable market will grow significantly as we continue to expand internationally, bring innovations like Omnipod 5 to market and further displace legacy therapies. We have made significant investments throughout our entire global business to support our robust innovation pipeline and global expansion. And in the face of COVID, the progress we made this past year in our manufacturing and supply chain operations was remarkable. We not only maintained a high-quality production, kept facilities open and met product demand levels. We also opened a new manufacturing facility in China and installed our third U.S. manufacturing line, further expanding our manufacturing and supply chain redundancy. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, finished the year on a high note and entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business. Our competitive differentiators remain unparalleled. And the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 will significantly strengthen our market position, and marks a major milestone in our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. And I did want to share in Q&A that we are under review now and that's part of what gives us great confidence in the launch into limited market release in the first quarter. Collaboration has been great and engaged on behalf of the agency. So, as we move into limited market release, we are looking to test a few things. So, the primary governor, as I said in my opening remarks, is going to be access. We have to establish broad access in the pharmacy channel. That work is underway, but will take us time to scale and so that's going to be the governor primarily. But what we will be looking for in limited market release, just in terms of indicators that it's successful and that we are ready to continue to expand as market access expands is we will be looking qualitatively just to understand the customer experience, the training experience and the access experience for people who are coming on to the product for multiple daily injections, for our existing users that are transitioning on to the product and for tube pump users that are transitioning on to the product. So we are just going to want it test that all of our systems, our training, our clinical support are going as we expect them to and the product experience is going as we expected to in each of those groups. As we validate that and as we establish access, that's what we will have us expand through the rest of this year and into full market launch either later this year or early next. We can move on to the next question. Thanks. Yes, Wayde, do you want to take that? Sure, Jayson, yes, we are thrilled to be celebrating the milestone of 0.25 million users relying on Omnipod. It's really exciting for the organization. That's a recently-hit milestone. Obviously, it's all estimates. So I always want to of predicate it with that, but that was a 2021 event. And there have not been changes in attrition or utilization. Those have really remained steady. That's terrific, actually because, obviously, as we anticipated the impact of the pandemic, we did anticipate that potentially, attrition could tick up we didn't see that. And that's part of the driver behind the really strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic. So that's great news on the business model and just the customer loyalty. Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris, our partnership with Tidepool has primarily been a clinical and product development one. So we've been supporting their regulatory submission and their development work. We don't have a commercial agreement at this point with Tidepool. So that's still to be worked out. I will say it's a tremendous undertaking to do that. So there is still a lot of work ahead of us. But that said, we do \u2013 we have said that we are working under way or we have work underway here with Omnipod 5 on the iOS platform. So I think it remains to be seen who's going to hit the market first with iOS, and we're certainly really excited about Omnipod 5. That remains our priority at this point. And we'll continue to support Tidepool's efforts in terms of their submission and their development. Sure. Thanks, Joanne, yes, we're really excited about just the continued in the Type 2 segment. It's just a group of users that have responded so well to the simplicity of DASH and some of the product benefits. I would say two things driving that. And one, as you know, is just increased awareness so that there are obviously a lot of people in the United States. We estimate over 2 million people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes who can benefit from the product. And so advertising as part of what's unlocking that. The other thing is you saw the step-up in increased access. And as we drive more availability in the pharmacy, this really differentiated business model that allows people to access it with such an affordable under $50 a month in out-of-pocket costs. That is in line with the cost of multiple daily injections for example. So it is incredibly affordable broad access that doesn't have the constraints that exist in other channels for the Type 2 segment. And that's sort of been our strategy really. We believe as we drive more simplicity into the product, we establish broader and affordable access to the tune of access in line with the cost of multiple daily injections. That's how we bring our technology to millions of patients, not just hundreds of thousands of patients. And so we're excited to see that. And I think that's part of what's been driving the Type 2 adoption and growth. Sure. Yes, I'll start, and then Wayde may have some color to add. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of visibility. I'll explain why. As we drive more utilization into the pharmacy channel, we have less visibility at this point to diagnosis at coverage. And so that is a little bit of a challenge for us because, obviously, all of our Medicare reimbursement is through the pharmacy channel. And 40% of people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes are over the age of 50 or 60. And so you can imagine that there is a lot of overlap behind our Medicare coverage in the pharmacy channel and the Type 2 segment. In terms of access, 75% is a number for all commercial coverage. There actually isn't a distinction in the pharmacy channel between Type 1 and Type 2 coverage. So that number is good for both segments. And given the progress we've made, particularly in Medicare Access, coverage is very strong and probably at $0 out-of-pocket for the Medicare user. So it's a really affordable, really broad access for the Type 2 user in the pharmacy channel, particularly for the Medicare Type 2 user. So I think all of that is contributing to the growth. And unfortunately, we don't have an updated total base number from what we gave a few years ago because we've been driving so much growth into the pharmacy channel. This is great for users, great for payers and great for us. But right now comes with a bit of a visibility challenge. Sure. So we're not going to give an update on the timeline. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market, and then we can start updating time lines for all the innovations that will follow around additional sensor integrations and additional phone platforms. But I have said multiple times in the last couple of calls that this work is underway. So we have teams of very talented people working on iOS phone control. We don't envision this will be a limiting factor for two reasons. One is we will provide every user a back up PDM with SIM technology. This gives users a constant connectivity to data and all the benefits of Omnipod 5. And remember, you only need that PDM or your Samsung phone if you're using phone control to pair a pod and to announce a meal. Otherwise, and for every 3 days when you time a pod. But otherwise, you can remain in automated mode in closed-loop because of the algorithm on the pod without your phone or your PDM, and all of your data is able to be viewed via our apps on your iPhone. So you're still going to get all of that visibility and ease of use through our apps on your iPhone. So we think it's going to be a great user experience for Apple users, and we're working very hard to get them full phone control as quickly as possible, and we'll update once we get to market with Omnipod 5. Thanks, Anthony, I don't have a size for the preschool segment. This is a smaller segment, so ages 2 to 6. But I can tell you it's an outsized importance segments, both in terms of the value of the technology to this group as well as the value of this group to Insulet. Today, we are the market leader in pediatrics. We see our ability to maintain and expand that segment. You think about the benefits of Omnipod for this segment, the ease of use and the discretion for young active children versus small active children having to contend with 3 to 4 feet of tubing and a large device, it's a particularly differentiated technology today without CGM integration and automated insulin delivery. And when we combine that for this group, it's going to be incredibly powerful. So we know, based on the response and the feedback from our trial participants, and I think the strong indicator that 100% of users completed the trial and moved on to the extension phase, all really important indicators that we're going to have a winning product in this population. Sure, Matt. We're excited to be partnered with Abbott. Their product has been particularly adopted in international markets. There are certain countries where they are a dominant shareholder. And as they continue to drive ease of use and awareness, they are a terrific partner for us. As I mentioned, we won't be giving updated time lines until we get our current generation with DexCom out into the market. We're very excited about the value that, that's going to drive. But both sensor partners, DexCom and Abbott, are driving, they are transforming the market. They are bringing real-time insights to users. And that adoption is helping to fuel Omnipod adoption. And so both are very important to us. And we see the potential to bring a long line of innovations with our partnerships with both DexCom and Abbott. So we are working on that. Just like iOS, we have had teams of people focused on that integration, and that work is underway and excited to update the market after we get Omnipod 5 to the market. Sure. Yes, that's a great question. So Dr. Bode will be presenting some early results from our feasibility study in Type 2. So if you remember, we had mentioned on the last call that we had launched our feasibility work. And I mentioned in my remarks today that, that continues, enrollment continues. That research is going very well. We expect, and we are learning great things regarding the Type 2 segment. And so from those learnings, we will then enter into a larger pivotal study, which will then drive expansion in indications and the label for Omnipod 5. So that is what will play out over the coming months and potentially, a year or longer. We haven't given a timeline on that. But Dr. Bode will be sharing his experience and his research with Omnipod 5 in the Type 2 segment. We believe that our technology can bring tremendous value to this segment to drive improved outcomes, certainly and tremendous ease of use. And so we are committed to doing the research, and he's been a great partner with us on that front. Sure. Kyle, you heard that correct that we will be launching Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel, and we will be launching at price parity. So that was a very thoughtful decision that we've made. And the goal behind that is really just to drive more rapid access and more affordable access. And so what this means, it's actually really exciting because what this means is, today, as I mentioned earlier, a DASH user pays less than $50 a month on average for the technology, we're going to be able to bring our remarkable and advanced technology in Omnipod 5 for the same type of co-pay for users. I mean, in line with MDI for many users. So that is really exciting, and we think the right thing to do to truly unlock this population. It's a great channel for payers, a great channel for patients and a great channel for Insulet. We are driving into the pharmacy channel because of all of the benefits that we've talked about, and we view Omnipod 5 as an opportunity to bring more users into that channel, which has great benefits for payers and for patients, frankly. So \u2013 and you are right that access will be the primary governor. I think back to DASH, we established \u2013 it took us about 2 years to establish broad access, where we are in the 70% plus range with DASH. And I would expect, if you think about what we were doing with DASH, we were also launching a new business model and establishing the channel, so, all of our partnerships and IT integrations with wholesalers and pharmacies. All of that work is now transferable and there and established for Omnipod 5. Our conversations are underway with payers and making good progress. And so we do expect that we will establish access more rapidly than DASH. But at this point, I think that's the primary performance indicator that we will be updating all of you on is just how we're doing with covered lives because that's going to be the primary driver of our success as we move through the limited market release. Yes. No reason for them to hold off. In fact, there may be reasons for them to get on, and I'll explain that. And when we think about the training pathways, the user interface with DASH is sort of the foundation and the user experience is the foundation for Omnipod 5 and so the training is likely to be much more streamlined for somebody who is moving from, for example, Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. And so it may just help you speed up if you get onto Omnipod DASH, as you're headed to Omnipod 5, but certainly no reason to hold off. As we said, we are not going to be charging any upfront conversion fee. Anybody, frankly, who is using any technology, whether that is Omnipod DASH, whether that is legacy Omnipod or MDI or a tube pump. As soon as we have pharmacy access established for them, they should be able to get on to the product with no upfront fee and very reasonable out-of-pocket costs. And we've worked really hard to kind of conceive of and deploy that strategy to help bring our technology to more people more rapidly. Yes, we got you. Sure. I think all great observations there. There are, in my view, three things that are driving Type 2 adoption for Omnipod. And the first is we have the right business model in the right channel for Type 2 users. So the fact that we can provide this very affordable, broad access with very few constraints as part of what is driving adoption. The second is just increasing awareness of the simplicity of our technology, and that's coming through our efforts on both the sales and marketing front. And the third is CGM adoption. And this is actually a really important dynamic for us. As we think about not just 2021, but the next several years. What the CGM companies have done is really dramatically displace blood glucose monitoring in the Type 1 population. And now they have their sites set on the Type 2 population. And we've been benefiting significantly from that conversion as patients, first in Type 1 and now more significantly, in Type 2. As these users get visibility to their data and how little time they are spending in range, they are looking for tools like Omnipod to help get them in range, and they are also comfortable wearing something because CGM has gotten them over that psychological barrier. So all three of those things are helping to drive our success in Type 2, and I think the technology is really well suited. So as we see progress and further advancement in adoption of CGM, this is a great trend for us in the market. Sure. Yes, sure. I think I won't comment on ultimate penetration because I just think it's going to take time with this segment. We're just in really early days here relative to the Type 1 segment. So we're more comfortable saying, hey, Type 1s can get over 50% because we're mature and we're \u2013 we see where we are in that adoption curve. We're standing on the precipice with Type 2s, and we're seeing great adoption, but it's very small penetration into this massive opportunity. When you think about the intensively managed Type 2 user, there really isn't much different in their need. And we do think that all of the work we're doing to establish broad, affordable access to drive unparalleled simplicity into our technologies that those advantages are, I would argue, more important for the Type 2 user than the Type 1 user. But regardless, they are important for all of our users and should drive continued adoption. And we see both segments, Type 1, particularly as we start \u2013 as we bring Omnipod 5 to market, we think that will be an accelerator for growth in the marketplace. And then as we look at Type 2, we've got a product today that is incredibly simple and being very enthusiastic embraced. And then as we \u2013 kind of the next wave is as we bring the simplicity of Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 market, we think that can further unlock it. So we're excited about the long-term prospects for the Type 2 space. Thank you. I wanted to share that recently one of our Omnipod 5 principal investigators for our pivotal study, Dr. Desalvo, from Baylor, he shared his feedback on Omnipod 5 with us. And what he said was to, not only have you achieved outstanding clinical results, but the diabetes burden has been ameliorated. And the satisfaction is unlike anything I have experienced before, especially for caregivers. It's clear that this is about the patients and their families. And he is right it is about our customers and their families. This is what gets us going every single day. We are so proud of the progress we've made. We're now changing the lives of 0.25 million people across the globe, and we're not going to stop there. Insulet and our customers' days \u2013 best days are still ahead. So thank you very much. Have a great evening. We will talk to you next quarter."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and the press release discussing our third quarter 2020 results and fourth quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures aligned with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis, and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll update you on our progress with our strategic imperatives, and then many reasons we are excited about the future. Wayde will discuss our financial results and outlook for the rest of this year, and then we'll open the call to your questions. We remain in challenging unprecedented times. The progress we've made despite this challenging environment, demonstrates the durability of our recurring revenue business model, OmniPod's differentiated form factor and the commitment and resilience of the Insulet team. Together, our team has cared for our users who need our support, advanced our innovation pipeline and delivered another remarkable quarter on all aspects of our business. We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 20%. Our U.S. and international OmniPod product lines, each achieved another record revenue quarter. New customer starts were stronger than expected, and we now expect to deliver our fifth consecutive year of 20% revenue growth despite the pandemic. We also expect to finish 2020 above our pre-COVID expectations at the start of the year. While delivering strong performance, we are also building a foundation to drive adoption in our enormous and growing market over the long-term. In just the markets we currently serve, there are approximately 10 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes, who could benefit from improved quality of life and better outcomes with OmniPod. This market opportunity will grow significantly as we move into new geographies, expand awareness and access to our technologies and bring our game-changing consumer-oriented innovations to market. Our highest \u2013 our long-term growth will be supported by the manufacturing expertise required to produce the highest quality products, while increasing gross margins. We are investing in each of these areas to build enduring advantages that will enable us to improve the lives of people with diabetes for many years to come. I'll start with expanding access and awareness. We are establishing market access so OmniPod is easily available regardless of age, type of diabetes or payer. Our access through the U.S. pharmacy channel offers customers an unusually simple onboarding experience. Benefit checks are swift. Co-pays are low and don't come with a large one-time cost. And virtual training is quick and effective. While COVID-19 has presented challenges, it also has pushed us to embrace virtual training, which is now preferred by users and providers. We expect these newly developed capabilities to continue to provide value as we scale our business. Approximately 80% of our new customers in the third quarter were multiple daily injection users attracted to OmniPod's ease-of-use and unique form factor. Additionally, approximately one-third of our U.S. new customers were Type 2, up from last quarter. Fueling the success with MDI and Type 2 is OmniPod DASH. Since launched 18 months ago, awareness of OmniPod DASH's unparalleled simplicity has grown and we have built a broad pharmacy access in the United States. By the end of Q3, we had secured coverage for 65% to 70% of covered lives for OmniPod DASH. With OmniPod DASH in the pharmacy, MDI users no longer pay large upfront costs or get locked into a four-year contract to try an insulin pump. They can start on OmniPod with a free trial and no lock-in period. We are thrilled to be knocking down barriers and enabling OmniPod to bring improved quality of life and outcomes to more people with diabetes. In our progress on establishing broad market access through the pharmacy channel, the time was right to launch a small-scale direct-to-consumer advertising pilot. We launched the pilot in September and have been learning a ton. While we know our DTC is working to raise awareness, we are still monitoring key performance metrics, such as lead conversion rates and retention of DTC-generated customers. We know increased awareness is key to growing adoption, and we are delighted to be in such a strong position to invest and explore this area. While our world has been challenged with the pandemic, our team has not missed a beat in advancing our innovation pipeline. OmniPod 5 is the world's first tubeless wearable AID system and the only one fully controlled by a user's mobile phone. With OmniPod 5, we will give our customers freedom, simplicity and integration with personal consumer technology like no other system on the market today. Our automated insulin delivery platform is transformative technology with potential applications in a variety of segments. And our initial launch of OmniPod 5 for Type 1 diabetes users aged seven plus, marks our first step. We are excited about the impact it will make in the market and on the lives of people with diabetes. Over time, we will be investing in clinical studies to first explore and then prove OmniPod 5's utility in more market segments. We are thrilled to have recently completed our OmniPod 5 pivotal trial and remain on track to launch in the first half of this coming year. While our team prepares for FDA submission, virtually all of the trial participants have transitioned into a pivotal extension phase. They will remain on product and provide us with critical additional data to support OmniPod 5's value proposition with payers and with clinicians. This data will also help inform our future innovations beyond OmniPod 5. We are excited to share our clinical results. And given ATTD has been delayed, we are evaluating the best alternative to do so. Our OmniPod 5 pre-school pivotal study with two to six year olds is under way with all 80 participants on product. OmniPod ranks number one within this demographic, and we are delighted to have kicked off our pivotal study to make OmniPod 5 available down to age two. Our goal is to have the expanded indication by the end of 2021 for this young population and their caregivers. Additionally, following the FDA's acceptance of our Type 2 clinical study protocol, in September, we began enrollment. This feasibility study will include 30 to 40 participants, each wearing OmniPod 5 for approximately two months. As we learn more from our growing Type 2 user base, we know there is a large market for an appropriate Type 2 AID system. We are confident an OmniPod AID system will provide great value for the Type 2 population, and we expect our early clinical work will result in important learnings. OmniPod's form factor, our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy and our experience developing exceptionally simple products position us uniquely to grow pod use month Type 2 users. While we prepare for OmniPod 5's submission and commercial launch, we are also making progress on our future products. We are advancing our collaborations with Dexcom and Abbott who are rapidly and meaningfully raising awareness of diabetes technology among Type 1 and Type 2 users. CGM is helping users recognize that they need better insulin delivery solutions. And CGM adoption is paving the way for generations of OmniPod products to meet these needs. In addition to integration with our next generation sensors, we have exciting work under way to make OmniPod 5 compatible with iOS. And we continue to advance our algorithm to expand our lead in simplicity and ease-of-use. Now, turning to our progress in our international markets. We have seen a gradual recovery in our European markets. And in September, we announced the full commercial rollout of OmniPod DASH. Our teams have done a remarkable job preparing our markets to support this launch, and our customers are loving the product. Now 100% of our new customers in Europe start on OmniPod DASH. In September, we announced the start of our geographic expansion efforts, and we are on track to enter five new markets by early 2021. We're taking a deliberate approach to our international expansion as we build our capabilities in each market and leverage our existing teams and strong distributor relationships. While it will take time to broaden our presence, over the longer term, our expanded global footprint will significantly increase our total addressable market. Finally, turning to operational excellence. In order to meet the growing demand for OmniPod, we are increasing capacity in both the United States and China. We are making considerable progress with the ramp of our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. And we are nearing completion of our third line installation, which we expect will produce sellable product next year. We have also made an investment in another contract manufacturer in China, allowing us to leverage our local supplier base and highly experienced team to quickly scale. These investments strengthen our global manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure that over the long-term we have the capacity and redundancy to meet increased global demand for our products. In summary, the world remains challenged with the impact of the global pandemic. However, the compelling benefits of OmniPod, the uniqueness and durability of our recurring revenue model and the outstanding execution of our team provide significant insulation for Insulet. We delivered strong financial and operational performance, and we are taking the appropriate steps to expand our innovation pipeline, grow our addressable markets and enhance our global manufacturing capabilities. Our team is focused on finishing the year strong and sustaining our momentum as we move toward launch of OmniPod 5 in the first half of 2021. And most importantly, we remain focused on improving the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Shacey. Our third quarter marked a continuation of our strong performance, as we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth, including record quarterly revenue for our diabetes product lines. We've maintained a solid track record of performance, largely due to our loyal customers and the commitment and execution of our global Insulet team. We are steadily advancing our strategic imperatives and delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Turning to the third quarter financial results. We delivered 20% revenue growth ahead of our expectations and $9 million above our guidance range. Total OmniPod growth was 18%, which was the major driver of our outperformance at $6 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery revenue also finished ahead of our expectations with growth of 47%, which was $3 million above our guidance range. In our total OmniPod business, the pandemic was a smaller headwind than expected. It negatively impacted global new customer starts in both the second and third quarters. This creates a compounding impact on our revenue, which we began to see in the third quarter and we'll continue to see an impact into the fourth quarter and first half of 2021. Despite this headwind and as a result of our year-to-date strong results and continued execution, we now expect full year 2020 total OmniPod revenue growth to exceed our start of the year pre-COVID expectations. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance for new customer starts. We expect that the pandemic would lower our beginning of the year expectations by 30% to 50%. Our results were favorable in both the U.S. and international regions with the combined impact slightly less than 30%. Additionally, both the U.S. and international had significant sequential improvements resulting in approximately half of the impact in Q3 versus Q2. Attrition and utilization for total OmniPod were stable sequentially. Looking by product line, U.S. OmniPod revenue grew 21%, exceeding our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q3 revenue included a headwind of an approximate 4 million decrease in distributor channel inventory levels, partially offsetting estimated channel inventory built in the first half of the year, mainly due to the pandemic. Our strong growth was driven by further expansion of our customer base, increased OmniPod DASH adoption and the mix benefit from the shift to the pharmacy channel, including the premium on DASH where we provide the PDM to customers at no charge. In the third quarter, OmniPod DASH drove approximately 65% of our U.S. new customer starts. And we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total U.S. volume. International OmniPod revenue grew 12% compared to our guidance range of 9% to 11%, primarily due to better than expected new customer starts. Channel inventory growth in the quarter of an estimated 4 million to 5 million was primarily driven by stocking shipments of OmniPod DASH and with similar to the amount of estimated increased distributor orders we experienced in Q3 2019. Drug delivery revenue increased 47% compared to our guidance range of 23% to 28%. Similar to Q2, the overachievement was due to our partners' increased forecast related to the current environment. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 65%, up 80 basis points, exceeding our expectations. Key drivers of our gross margin expansion included improving performance of our U.S. manufacturing as we ramp our newly implemented automated lines as well as the favorable revenue mix from the shift to higher volume through the pharmacy channel. Also contributing was favorable product line mix. While positive foreign exchange was a 60 basis point tailwind, it was offset by a 60 basis point headwind from one-time COVID-related costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses in the third quarter were largely in line with our expectations on a dollar basis and slightly lower as a percentage of revenue given our strong top-line performance. Expenses increased on a dollar basis, primarily due to the marketing costs as well as R&D and clinical spend for OmniPod 5. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 18.1% in the third quarter, up from 15.4% in the prior year. Our profitability improvement benefited from operations with improved gross margins and operating expense leverage and the change in other income. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the third quarter with $897 million in cash and investments. Subsequent to Q3, we raised an additional $130 million of cash related to building and equipment financings as these type of arrangements helped to reduce our overall cost of capital. The additional cash further strengthens our position and allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives. Our investments are primarily to scale manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as for R&D programs, global commercial and sales force expansion and international product and geographic expansion. We are uniquely positioned to drive rapid growth by serving a large and underpenetrated market, and our strong cash position provides us with capital to further strengthen our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our revised outlook for 2020. As a result of third quarter revenue that exceeded expectations, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance to growth of 20% to 21%, up from our previous expectations of 17% to 19% and above our beginning of year estimate. This includes raising total OmniPod revenue to a range of 21% to 22%. Our total OmniPod growth rates are now back in line with our original guidance set at the start of the year pre-COVID, which is a testament to the resilience of our durable annuity model and the execution of our Insulet team. By product line, for U.S. OmniPod, we are raising our expected revenue growth to 23% to 24%. And for international OmniPod, we are raising our expectations to 18% to 19%. Although COVID to create uncertainties and it is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic or the probability of a resurgence, we now expect the global new customer starts for the full year of 2020 will improve to approximately 75% of our beginning of the year estimate. Despite the challenging environment, our global diabetes business remains well positioned to generate strong growth this year as well as in 2021 and beyond. Lastly, for drug delivery, we are updating our expected revenue growth to 4% to 6%, resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. As a result of our outperformance in the third quarter and stronger revenue outlook, we are raising our full year 2020 gross margin guidance to approximately 64%, up from approximately 63%. This includes the headwind of $9 million to $10 million or approximately 100 basis points of estimated one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $7 million to $10 million. We now expect 2020 capital expenditures will be below prior year levels due to projects coming in favorable to estimated spend and due to timing. Our long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plans remain unchanged. And we therefore expect capital expenditures to grow again next year to support scaling manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as advancements in our innovation pipeline and commercial and international expansion. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our previously stated 13% to 17% range. Turning to fourth quarter 2020 guidance. We now expect total company revenue growth of 7% to 11%. This includes total OmniPod revenue growth of 10% to 14%, which as a reminder, reflects the compounding of lower new customer starts from the prior two quarters related to the pandemic. By product line, we expect U.S. and international OmniPod revenue each to grow 10% to 14% and drug delivery to decline 17% to 23%. In terms of new customers, we now expect global new customer starts to improve in the fourth quarter to a range of 15% to 25%, less than our beginning of the year expectations. This compares to the 25% impact we guided to on our Q1 and Q2 calls. In conclusion, we achieved strong growth year-to-date despite the impact from the global pandemic. This speaks to the power of our differentiated market position through product innovation and durable recurring revenue model. Our innovation pipeline is strong and our financial position is sound. We are focused on finishing the year strong and building momentum as we enter 2021. Assuming market conditions stabilize next year, we remain on track to deliver our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin in the range of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue at the low end of mid-teens. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. This is Brandon on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question. First if I could just focus on the Q4 guide. Can you just talk about what kind of maybe COVID headwinds are baked into that? We've obviously seen a lot of resurgence of COVID globally. So does that kind of bake in things getting worse or does it kind of assume that things stay the same as we go through the fourth quarter?\nWayde McMillan: Hey, Brandon. It's Wayde. I can start with that one. And it's a good place to start actually because this is obviously a major driver in the business today, and it's really different in the U.S. and international, as you said. So if we talk about the U.S. first, we've been performing quite well in the U.S. And new customer starts have been below our beginning of year expectations in Q2 and Q3, but we've been building momentum in the business, and Q4 is going to be pretty close to Q4 in the prior year. And just a reminder, Q4 in the prior year was our all-time highest new customer starts. And so we get a really tough comp in Q4. But in the U.S., the momentum has been building. We've got a lot of things driving that momentum. DASH is still a primary driver for us. The move into Type 2 is still early. The pharmacy model with pay-as-you-go is working well. We've made investments in our commercial business and expanding the sales force. And then our teams have done a great job ramping the virtual training. So there's just a lot of positives that are somewhat offsetting those headwinds from new customer starts. And as a result, we still got double-digit growth in our guide. And so for the U.S., it's going to be pretty close. If we can get to the high end of our guide or even above, then new customer starts are going to be pretty strong for us in Q4. From an international standpoint, it's a different story. The recovery has been slower. And as you mentioned, we've seen recently a few countries going more back into a lockdown. And so in speaking with our field teams there, they do anticipate it's going to be more challenging. But what's different than Q2 when this really caught everybody by surprise is our teams are much more effective now, it's still staying in contact with their customers, finding ways to connect with them, and DASH is a great \u2013 it's just great timing for us to be launching DASH because it gives our teams an opportunity to still get those meetings with physicians and with customers. And so we do think that new customer starts will continue to be more of a headwind above or at the high end of this range for us, but our teams are doing a better job, and there is lots of momentum. I mentioned, DASH newly launched internationally, but we've made sales force expansion there and we're also expanding into new countries. And so there is a lot of momentum building in behind this pandemic. And so I think we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of the day, the anticipated headwinds to the extent we can, I mean, it's obviously very difficult to predict how much impact the pandemic will have, but we've built the assumption into the high end and low end of our guidance ranges. And just depending on how impactful it is, it should land us in the range. If we see something like Q2 again, that was pretty extreme, and I think that would be something that would probably push us out of the range.\nBrandon Vazquez: Great. That's really helpful color. And then the last one for me. As \u2013 I appreciate it's probably too early to get into specific numbers for 2021, but maybe it might be helpful if you just kind of \u2013 how are you thinking about 2021 internally about what kind of COVID catalyst, whether it'd be a vaccine, whether a widespread available vaccine, what kinds of catalysts are you looking forward to kind of get back to normal pre-COVID levels? And on the same token, does COVID potentially slow the rollout of OmniPod 5 given that may be needs a little bit more hands on training given it's a closed loop or perhaps that's an incorrect assumption? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks, Brendan, for the question. And I think what we had said at the beginning of this year is that we did expect to see continued improvement throughout the year and then we were hoping for normalization in 2021. And I don't want to sort of predict what's going to happen in 2021, but I think it's great to see where we are now predicting to close this year, because it means we're ahead of what we expected in terms of the potential impact of COVID. And regardless of what happens with the vaccine and the macro environment, our teams are getting great at managing and making an impact in this environment, and that's because of some of the things that Wayde just mentioned, our virtual training tools and various capabilities that we've built. In terms of OmniPod 5, that is a product that we have spent so much design work and thinking and organizational focus on simplicity and ensuring that everything from the onboarding experience through to the use experience of the system is simple. And it is designed to be a product that \u2013 and it's simple enough that MDI users and kids can easily get on to and be successful with. So I don't anticipate that COVID is going to slow us down. There is just incredible enthusiasm in the market and internally with all of us to get that product on to the market, and we're going to make that happen regardless of what's happening in the macro environment. Thank you.\nBrandon Vazquez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Allen: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Patrick on for Matt. Thank you. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow-up just a little bit on the COVID environment. You implemented your financial assistance program in April, can you give us a sense for the participation within that program? And I know it runs till December of this year, but as some people may have roll off their COBRA insurance plan, do you envision this dynamic to further the utilization of that program or any color there would be really appreciated? Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Patrick. I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit more color on utilization of the program. But at a high level, I'll say that it's something that I think we as a company are very proud of and that we were out front and able to offer this assistance to our users. This is very much about ensuring that while COVID is negatively impacting in an outsized fashion our partners that they can remain on product. And so we're proud of the program and our intent is to \u2013 we were committed through the end of this year. If we feel like that need may persist, then we will certainly evaluate continuing the program.\nWayde McMillan: And on the numbers, Patrick, they have been quite small actually. I think you mentioned COBRA, but there has been many other options for people including Medicaid in the states or alternative insurance in the household. So we haven't seen that many people on the program. But having said that, we've always had financial assistance program and we've had several \u2013 quite a few people on that over the years. And so this is really an enhancement to that program, and we haven't met the number of people that we had on our original program yet. So it's not like it's been a significant pick-up at this point. But as Shacey said, we're really happy to have it in place. If we have current customers that can't afford the product given the current situation they're in, we're more than happy to backstop them and help them continue with their therapy until they can access it through normal channels again.\nPatrick Allen: That's really helpful color, guys. Thank you for that. And my quick follow-up. I'd love to hear more about the DTC campaign efforts that you're making. I know you started a limited national DTC that seems to be doing well, and you'll have more KPIs to kind of gauge how successful that program is. But how should we think about the DTC efforts into next year with some of the COVID impacts still kind of percolating and OmniPod 5 coming out? Like, how are you thinking about the broader rollout for that DTC campaign as you round the corner of 2020 into 2021? And thanks for taking the questions again.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Patrick, it's funny, you're asking the questions that we're asking ourselves internally. I mean, one of the reasons why we wanted to do DTC this year before launching OmniPod 5 is that we really wanted to learn about the impact, learn about the messaging that's most effective, the channels that are most effective. We've been expanding our DTC over the last couple of years through digital channels, but this is the first time that we've really stuck our toe into television. And it's clear from the early numbers that we've made an impact on awareness. It certainly is driving increased awareness. And what we are looking at now is just how does that awareness convert into actual customers over what period of time and to what degree. And then are those customers \u2013 because remember, we have eliminated all barriers to getting on the product. Patient can get on to OmniPod in the pharmacy without any upfront cost and basically with a free trial. And so we want to make sure that those patients stay on the product to the extent that our customer base does. So those are the things that we're evaluating before we determine to what extent we increase our investment in DTC in 2021. And our plan is to give a bit more color on the next call when we're bringing and we should have learned more by then and have a better point of view in terms of expanding. But I think what's exciting is that now that we have the position that we have in the pharmacy channel, we actually have the scale and the position to kind of support increased demand. And so that is really exciting to us in the DME channel, getting patients through the process and onto the product is a bit more cumbersome. And for patients to be able to walk into the pharmacy, get the product, have no upfront cost and have that sort of easy onboarding experience, is the right time to start to learn more about DTC. And we're encouraged and stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on a really good quarter. I have two questions. First Shacey I was hoping you could give us your thoughts on the status of new patients and where they're coming from? I'm sure a lot of it is DASH, I'm sure a lot of it's the form factor, the lower out of pocket. But if you think about when you have Horizon 5, one of your competitors with an integrated solution is outpacing in terms of new patient growth and a lot of it has to do with the AID solution. So how should we think about as we set our models, the benefit from DASH, but also the benefit that's coming once you have a competitive AID solution?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, I think those are great questions and I think really highlight why we're so excited about OmniPod 5. You see the growth that we're driving, Wayde said, in Q4, in the U.S., we could be back to a, all-time record quarter at the high end of our guidance for new patients. So we're seeing a great recovery. That recovery is being driven as it\u2019s, frankly always has been off of OmniPod\u2019s form factor. 80% of new users are coming from MDI. So we continue to grow the overall market and that's being driven by OmniPod factor by pharmacy access in both Type 1 and Type 2 MDI users. That is a population that is just very attracted to DASH and its simplicity. I think we'll continue to see that segment adopt OmniPod based on its form factor and based on the out-of-pocket economics. Actually in the pharmacy channel, the vast majority of our patients are accessing OmniPod for less than a $50 co-pay. So it's very economic. It's very attractive in terms of form factor and the access channel and so those are driving demand today. I think what you are highlighting is why we \u2013 people are so excited about OmniPod 5 is that you can really see the power of integration with the Dexcom sensor and AID. And up until the next few months when we get, or the next several months, when we get OmniPod 5 out into the market, patients have had to choose between what we know is a preferred form and integration with the Dexcom sensor. And obviously, in the first half of 2021, they'll no longer have to choose. And so I'm not going to make predictions on exactly how that's going to change our trends. I think we certainly expect it to be an accelerator. And I think the question is what changes in terms of MDI users coming on to the product, or do we see more pump users coming onto the product, because remember they can adopt OmniPod 5 without any cost and without a four-year lock-in period. So we're really excited to basically check every box that patients are looking for in terms of an insulin delivery system and an AID system in particular with OmniPod 5.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe one for Wayde. Wayde you\u2019ve clearly demonstrated a conservative approach to guidance since you've come in as CFO. And particularly I'd say a very conservative stance to guidance during COVID-19. And I understand with good reason all the unpredictability, especially with cases starting to rise again. I think I asked you this last question and you far out ceded your guidance range. But I'm going to ask you again on this call, can you help us understand some of the underlying metrics that get you to a range that I would say people would say seems fairly conservative, large destocking that we should think about? Are you willing to give us maybe what volume versus mixed price was in third quarter? And is that going to be materially different in fourth quarter? Just trying to get a sense of some of the underlying trends here. And how much of it is conservatism versus just a downward move in the numbers. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Hey, Robbie. First of all, glad you brought up guidance. We're very happy that we chose to issue guidance back in Q2 at the front end of this pandemic. It was a big decision. But when we looked at the recurring revenue model that we're in and how that really defends against a one quarter impact, like the pandemic happened in Q2, and that we were going to see a potential new customer starts impacting us for a few quarters, it compounds. And so that it's really math and it's our new customer starts over a few quarters, they compound. Q4 ends up with three quarters, including Q2, which was the lowest in it. So that's why we have a bigger headwind in new customer starts in Q4 than we've seen. The comment on conservatism, I mean, I'll take that every time because we held guidance and we did it because we wanted to make sure people understood our business model and that we could articulate our business by putting the ground and adding additional metrics so we could talk to it. The major drivers of our business, like you said, are mostly volume. And our business is very much a volume business now. As we sell through the pharmacy, we start to get into more and more distribution channels. There will be other ways for people to access our product over time. So it definitely becomes a volume business. And so for us mix plays an important component today, moves as we move customers from our traditional DME and direct channels into the pharmacy. And the premium that we get for the pay-as-you-go model, because we're given the PDM for no charge, those are dynamics today. But they are far away by the volume increases in the business.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. Appreciate it. And just one very quick clarification. Are there any major conferences to present the pivotal data now that ATTD has been under, should we expect it in the label? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, thanks Robbie. We are evaluating that. We had a great forum with ATTD and our clinical investigators being invited to share the data. But obviously we were just recently notified that it's been delayed till May. So we're looking to see other appropriate forums for us to get it out there. And there's just a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, the most important thing is that we get FDA clearance and get to launch top of next year. So we don't want to get the data out ahead of that and maybe ruffle feathers at the FDA. So we're looking at our options and we certainly understand, and we're enthusiastic to get it out there as soon as possible. But I don't have specifics to provide today.\nOperator: Thank you. Actually our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions here. Wayde, I wonder if next year is a year when we think about OmniPod 5 launching certain margin considerations that you've talked about fair amount this year, and then of course COVID impacting new patients starts, which could sort of bleed into early part of 2021. Is there anything sort of high level we should be thinking about as we think about the models next year in terms of new patients starts, margins, mix of business any considerations at all that could be helpful as we think about 2021 modeling?\nWayde McMillan: Yes, I think, you just checked off the major ones, David. And let's start with COVID because this is one of the ones that's harder to predict for us, we've got this progression, we've seen a significant improvement from Q2 into Q3. We're expecting a pretty big step up in the U.S. At the high end of our guide, we're only a few percentage points off our beginning of your estimate and that was a pretty strong estimate. So we're anticipating pretty strong recovery in the U.S. If we get there, then it really is about how does COVID hit us in 2021. And that's the unknown. And we'll obviously know more after we get through Q4 and we're set up to give our 2021 guide. We always give our guide at our Q4 call. And so, we'll have a much better feel, I think, for what at least the early part of 2021 will look like in the U.S. Outside the U.S. international, we're seeing more and more lockdowns already here in the quarter. And so that's \u2013 we're so far we feel comfortable, we'll be in the range that we've provided for international, but again, next year it makes it a much more challenging thing. So, with, COVID, obviously that's a question mark. For the other drivers that you mentioned OmniPod 5, that one comes \u2013 first half of the year will be our limited market release and so we won't see a material impact until the second half of the year. So from a modeling standpoint, to your question, David, I would think about OmniPod 5, starting to ramp in the second half of the year. Gross margins, we were very happy to report just under 65. And I think we can think about the same for Q4, and that really sets us up for the 67 to 70 next year. We do have a lot of programs going. We announced recently that we've stood up another third party manufacturing plant in China. And so we're working our first two lines there to get sellable product. And so we've got a lot of things happening inside of that gross margin number, but they are all designed to get us set up so that we can increase capacity on a short-term basis if we need to. And at the same time we're ramping up the U.S. So I think we're squarely in that 67% to 70% range for next year. Depending on the volume and depending on how fast we ramp, we could be at the low end, but we could just as easily be at the high end. And so I think from a modeling standpoint gross margin is just right in that 67% to 70% range. From a mix standpoint, we'll continue to see the mix benefit less from the pharmacy channel. We're not done moving customers from the DME and direct side of the business, into the pharmacy and ramping up DASH. The one thing that's still a question mark for us there is, what we'll be pricing OmniPod 5 at and whether we'll have premium price or price parity there? So there's a few open questions, Dave, that we'll look to clarify when we get to our earnings \u2013 or pardon me, our guidance in our Q4 call.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Super helpful. Just one more question for Shacey. So Wayde the third quarter, momentum slowdown in the U.S. I'm sort of assuming, because you guided to momentum slowed in the fourth quarter that just reflects probably the peak COVID new patients start impacting the third quarter, and there's kind of no change in underlying U.S. fundamentals. And then just for Shacey, as I think about OmniPod 5 next year and some of the different things you've talked about these last couple of calls, you always talk about MDI, you've talked about Type 1 as well. As you think about the impact of OmniPod 5 in the market next year, is it mounted for you Type 1 conversions, Type 1 share, which has not been necessarily a significant driver of the business, what do you think it actually accelerates, the MDI conversion part of the business? I'm just kind of curious, which is the most, or the more underappreciated opportunity between the two? Thanks so much.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. So I can start then on the sequential growth that you mentioned, David and you're right, you can see it in our growth rates. Q2 is the problem quarter. I mean, that was a quarter where we had significantly lower new customer starts and we start to live with that for four quarters. And that's the big one that we will annualize out of the business in Q1 next year. And adding new customer starts from Q2 into three and four. So, I think four obviously has three quarters of compounded impact to it and that's factored into our guidance. But that's what I wanted to just share and give perspective on all the momentum we have building inside the business, because there's so much things happening. And really our goal here is to come out of the other side of the pandemic with as much momentum as we can around our new product innovations, around our business model strategies with Type 2 and the pharmacy, as well as the investments we've made in the salesforce and the commercial business including virtual training, as well as Shacey mentioned the end to end customer process. And so there's just so many good things that this compounding new customer start is offsetting for us. And so it's really our job to build the momentum here. Come out the other side stronger. Is Q4 going to be the trough? I don't know yet we have to see what the pandemic impact is in Q4 and then what Q1 looks like. But we really don't annualize out that tough Q2 until we get to Q1 next year.\nShacey Petrovic: And David, on your question on OmniPod 5, I think, it's a great question. And one we're looking forward to sort of seeing the answer in, in 2021. I guess I get most excited about the MDI users that are converting. Because if you think about what's happening today, nobody chooses, at least our data would indicate that nobody chooses a tubed pump because it has tubes. They choose it over OmniPod when they do, because it has a Dexcom integration. And so when we check that box and we obviously believe OmniPod 5 will be significantly differentiated, can be easier to use. And we think about key features like phone control, like constant access to data and all the other things that I've spoken about. When we check that box, should get a much larger \u2013 plus already today we get a very large percent of MDI conversions we should get a much larger one. So that to me is probably the biggest opportunity. Because if you think about the capital equipment model, some of those folks, most of those folks are locked into a four-year contract. And so 25% of them will come up. And I think it'll be interesting to see in that population, what happens in terms of adoption for OmniPod 5. But that's an area where we\u2019re a little less familiar with because we get less patients from that area today. What we know for sure is that MDI users are going to be very, very attracted to OmniPod 5. And when we check the box of integration and automation with Dexcom, that's going to be a very differentiated and appealing product.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on international, one on, of course OmniPod 5. So in the past, I think, you guys have talked about international growth being in the high teens, low 20% range. Is that still intact? Which new markets are you planning to launch it in 2021? I heard five new markets in the prepared remarks. How far behind is OmniPod 5, outside the U.S. compared to the U.S.? And I have one follow-up\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Maybe I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit of insight into the overall expectations for international growth. But there's nothing fundamental in the business that would change our long-term expectations for that business. It's just simply that we're in the midst of a pandemic and that there's been a slower recovery, in particularly Europe, than other parts of the world and particularly in the United States. So we remain very bullish on our expansion strategy over the long-term. And it's why I mentioned in my remarks that we're really starting in earnest our expansion in early 2021. And over time, this adds significant addressable market to us over the coming years. We didn't give the five markets. So we'll lay those out for you as we enter into them. We did get one checked off the box this quarter in Belgium. So actually one of the best entered. And we will let you know as we enter these markets, that those launches have occurred.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: And then I \u2013 sorry had also asked Larry about OmniPod 5 in international. We haven't given a timeline on that yet. Just to let everybody know that that work is underway and we are fully committed to bringing OmniPod 5, to our European markets and to all of our international markets.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you. And on OmniPod 5, do you guys typically announce have filed or submitted something like that? And is there any reason why the pivotal OmniPod 5 data would look much different from the pre-pivotal data we saw at ADA this year? For example, larger number of centers, anything that we should be aware of that would make that data, the pivotal data look meaningfully different from the pre-pivotal data that we should be aware of? Thanks for taking the questions.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, thanks Larry. And we don't \u2013 our practice to notify or become public when we submit, we simply share the news when we're cleared. So that's our general practice. In terms of the data, I really don't have much insight to offer there. We don't want to preview it. Obviously the pre pivotal data looked very, very strong and we are very excited to get the OmniPod pivotal data out there, but I don't want to give insight into just how it compares at this point.\nLarry Biegelsen: Understood. Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks Larry.\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions. Wayde you mentioned OmniPod 5 pricing and thoughts on a premium potentially for next year. I thought that was kind of settled at this point that you probably were going to go after access more than pricing just to try to get it out there faster and more broadly across the counts in that. So just, is there a region happening that maybe you could get a premium for all five or how to think about that?\nWayde McMillan: Yes, it's still a question for us, Jeff. There's a lot of different opportunities for us across the U.S. in particular. But like you said, a major consideration for us is getting it sold to our customers as fast as possible. And we certainly take into consideration the current environment that we're in, other AID systems that are in the marketplace. And so now that there is a significant opportunity for us to get there faster. Having said that, even if we go at parity pricing there's a long process to work through and we've put the infrastructure in place, we've built up our access teams, we built up our wholesalers and distributors, and we've learned a lot through the ramp up of DASH. And so it really is still a question for us. Jeff it really just depends on how we want to approach the market. Lots of benefits obviously to price premium, but there are just as many benefits and a very compelling one from a customer standpoint, to get it into the hands of our current customers, and new customers. So yes, that one is still a jump off for us.\nJeff Johnson: Okay, great. And just maybe the follow-up then is this cumulative math that we talked to a lot of investors about and it seems to confuse them at times and the way you guide to new patients starts relative to your pre-COVID expects. When I put all that in the blender, it does seem to create maybe a little confusion. Very simplistically in the 3Q when I take kind of all the data points you are providing, it seems to me your new patient starts in the U.S. were probably closed on par with what they were last year in the 3Q, which was a pretty good quarter, obviously 4Q 2019 was even stronger, but 3Q 2019, it seems like your U.S. new patient starts almost at parity with last year. And on an absolute basis, o-U.S. may be down marginally 5% or 10% year-over-year, but not dramatically down. Is that the fair way to be thinking about what they were on an absolute basis in the quarter itself?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. And you\u2019re right, it is challenging. And I'll just highlight again, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to provide guidance. So give us an opportunity to share more about it and to provide enough data points. And sounds like Jeff, you're close. What I would say is the U.S. was a little stronger headwind than you laid out there, but Q4 is going to be getting pretty close against a really tough comp in Q4. The U.S. business has been performing really well. And despite the headwind it's been on the low end of our stated new customer starts headwind. And then internationally, little higher again than the estimates you put out there. Those are a little lower than we're experiencing from our estimates. And we do expect international to persist more into Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening and thank you for taking the questions. I\u2019ll just put them all up front. What is the size of the two to six-year-old population that you are looking to go after with that incremental study? And then I'm trying to get my head around how OmniPod 5 ramps next year. We've heard limited launch, we've heard full launch, but you've got a very successful DASH product that's already out there. And I'm trying to just \u2013 if you could walk us through any milestones or mile posts we should think about, thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Joanne. I don't have the total population of two to six-year-olds in the market. It's obviously a really important population for us. Not necessarily because of the size of the population, but because we know that when people adopt OmniPod they stay with us. So we've always been strategically focused on the young pediatric population. And it's also a population where OmniPod is heavily, heavily differentiated for a variety of reasons. It's a much easier technology to use on young active children. So we're excited about getting everybody enrolled in our clinical trial and getting that label expansion ideally before the end of next year. In terms of milestones for OmniPod 5, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the company, as we think about ramping towards the OmniPod launch. We have obviously the clinical data analysis, and presentation and publication of the data, so that will be a milestone as we move forward. We have IT and commercial work going on to look at establishing our easy onboarding systems for OmniPod 5. We have market access work. So obviously we will start to build reimbursement in the pharmacy channel for OmniPod 5. And then we have a ton of work going on in medical affairs, et cetera. And then of course we have the cross-functional team working on a submission, which is going to be somewhere around 30,000 to 40,000 pages. So almost every individual function in the company is touching the OmniPod 5 launch in some way. And so lots of milestones happening internally in terms of our commercial progress, our manufacturing progress and our clinical progress. The next thing that we\u2019ll really announce is probably the data and then the clearance of the system. And so those are the things to look for kind of publicly externally. And you mentioned, is it a limited market release, is it a full market release? We've always maintained that we will do a limited market release. It's a high stakes product for us. We know it's the most anticipated innovation in the pipeline of all diabetes products. And so we want to get it right and a limited market release as part of doing that. So when we launch in the first half of 2021, we will launch into a limited market release. How long that will be, I think, remains to be seen because it depends upon when we're meeting our end points and our objectives for a limited market release. And that will be based on market access, manufacturing ramp, and customer feedback.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRyan Blicker: Hi, thanks for sticking me in. Maybe starting with the pharmacy channel transitions, you noted greater than 30% of U.S. volume is going to the pharmacy, which is similar to last quarter. 65% of new U.S. adds to the pharmacy. So the long-term outlook remains clear. But can you provide any additional color on why the pace of quarterly increases for total U.S. volume for the pharmacy has slowed a bit over the past couple quarters? And then looking to 2021, do you believe the OmniPod 5 launch will be a catalyst to convert a large portion of your existing install base to the pharmacy?\nShacey Petrovic: Hey Ryan, maybe I'll let Wayde talk about the specific numbers in terms of the pharmacy channel, but I would say that momentum is very strong in the pharmacy channel, access continues to increase. And we do expect that OmniPod 5 should be a catalyst in terms of pharmacy conversions because it really is going to be a pharmacy product. And so that we are committed to, we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And we know there's a lot of demand building for the technology.\nWayde McMillan: Right. You're correct. Our guidance is at greater than 30%. And just to clarify it is growing a couple of percentage points in our number. We just are keeping it rounded. So, as the quarters go quarter-to-quarter, we're probably not going to see major step-ups just given that our overall business grows as well. But as Shacey said, the majority of our new customers starts are on DASH. And DASH is primarily in the pharmacy. So we will continue to see the pharmacy volume grow over time.\nRyan Blicker : That's great. And then if I could ask a two-part follow-up on the Type 2 opportunity, so you talked again about ramping CGM penetration in the Type 2 patient population, which clearly bodes well for pump penetration over time. Just wondering, thus far in 2020, have you seen any evidence of pump penetration increasing among that Type 2 patient population, or do you believe the increase in your Type 2 mix is being more driven by share gains of new patients? And then acknowledging it's really early, I'd be curious to know the patient mix at least generated by your DTP program and whether or not it's driving a disproportionate level of interest among Type 2s. Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Ryan. Yes, so in terms of overall pump utilization in Type 2s, it's still pretty low penetration, and there's just a massive opportunity to go get with Type 2s. We see CGM as sort of a beachhead, right. As CGM adoption happens, which is happening, is very maturely happening and in Type 1, but just really getting going in Type 2. And we see that as a trend, as you said, bodes well for pump adoption. Other pumps are challenged from an access perspective. So we are very fortunate to be in the pharmacy channel, providing the pay-as-you-go model. That's really what's driving access and availability of OmniPod to the Type 2 population. So we know we've got a really appealing product. We know that the technology adoption curve for CGM is helping to drive this. But we are in a unique position, in terms of our channel and in terms of our form factor and OmniPod\u2019s discretion and ease of use to be able to win in that market. And so I think we are winning, right now we're winning primarily with MDI conversions, not other pumps. And I would be surprised if other pumps are seeing the level of conversion that we're seeing in Type 2s. And we're testing a bunch of different messages in DTC. So we do have actually messaging that is geared towards the Type 2 population. Too early at this point to be able to give a color on that. But as I said, as we lay out our expectations for 2021, we'll be able to give insight into DTC and what we expect that that's going to drive for us.\nRyan Blicker : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hi thanks for taking the questions. Just on the [indiscernible] study that you began [indiscernible] recently what you hope to gain from that, or [indiscernible] for OmniPod approval.\nWayde McMillan: Why don\u2019t just ask some\u2026\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Travis, I\u2019m sorry, you broke up there. So we didn't fully \u2013 you were a little garble, there were some interference. If you could repeat your question, that would be great.\nTravis Steed: Yes, sorry for that. The question was on the OmniPod 5 two feasibility studies, [indiscernible] you will gain from that if you need [indiscernible] approval for reimbursement coverage?\nShacey Petrovic: Okay, great, OmniPod 5 Type 2 feasibility study. So that is the first step in terms of our clinical exploration for Type 2s on OmniPod 5. So you may remember we did feasibility studies for Type 1 with OmniPod 5 as well. This really is a step in the eventual label expansion. And it's an early step. So, we will get 30 to 40 users on the product. We will look to see, does the algorithm perform as we would expect it to, for this segment, or do we need to tweak the algorithm? Remember, when we did our early feasibility studies with OmniPod 5, in the Type 1 population, we did a lot of work on the algorithm, a tremendous amount of work on the algorithm to deliver the performance that we saw in the pre-pivotals. Remember we had best-in-class hypoglycemia, we had great time and range, particularly with kids that came from just a lot of tweaking of the algorithm. And so we may need to do the same thing in the Type 2 population that remains to be seen. Feasibility study will give us those learnings. It will then map out for us how much clinical work do we have. And then we'll be able to determine what's the path for label expansion. In terms of reimbursement, we're fortunate in the pharmacy channel there really isn't a distinction between the Type 1 and Type 2 user. And so with label expansion that should pave the way for access in the pharmacy channel for a Type 2.\nTravis Steed: Okay. That's great. And one quick question on \u2013 as you look through like the early last few weeks as cases spiked in certain geographies, is there anything to call out that's different in those geographies? Just kind of curious how well-prepared the doctors\u2019 offices and patients are now versus how they were earlier this year.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, I think it's a good point. And we mentioned in the U.S. everything is getting more efficient and more effective working in this environment. Of course, we've talked a lot about the virtual tools for training and support that we've rolled out we really have built a lot of confidence and preference among our clinicians and our patients for that pathway of training. And so even as certain areas experience more challenges with the pandemic, we're able to continue to bring new patients onto the product. And so in the U.S., as Wayde said, we're feeling pretty good, right. The high end of our guidance in Q4 would indicate that we're going to be at a record quarter in Q4. So that's great. Outside of the U.S., it's a more fragmented and more challenged environment right now. And we still see that our virtual tools and the capabilities that we've built are certainly helping to ensure that we can continue to bring patients on. But as we have the UK heading back into a shelter-in-place, France, those are a little bit more challenged environments for us. And France in particular is a large market for us. So it's not like Q2. We certainly still see progression in terms of improved new patients starts outside of the U.S. and even in these more challenged markets. But there definitely is a headwind there that doesn't exist in the United States.\nTravis Steed: Thank you.\nOperator: I show our last question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBriana Warschun: This is Briana on for Raj. Thank you for taking your questions. I was hoping you could provide some detail on the mix of COGS running through [indiscernible] versus sources from Flex in China? And then how does the new manufacturing contract in China play into that mix? And then just a quick follow-up on that would be, what is the gross margin upside potential as more manufacturing shifts in house, and as a shift in automated manufacturing in the U.S. the key driver to the high end of your long-term gross margin target of 70%, or is there other things going into that 70%?\nWayde McMillan: Hi, Briana. Yes, you've actually touched on a couple of key drivers there. So the question was around mix COGS. And the key for us today is active manufacturing is a more expensive product because it's fairly low volumes on two lines in a plant that's designed for four automated lines. And a lot of the cost is fixed on the automated manufacturing lines. So today our production out of our Flex China facility is a lower cost than Acton. However, over time, it's designed that the automated manufacturing lines will be more efficient and get us this product. And that is as you mentioned, the single largest driver of improved gross margins for us over time. But in combination with that is scale. I think we are building significant, critical mass in the business here, as we accumulate more and more customers with our patch pump disposable design. And the investments that we've been making in manufacturing, both in the U.S. and in China, really build a critical mass of expertise, and know-how in how to do this. And as we scale and put volumes into it, those volumes help us drive gross margins significantly as well. And the new, third-party manufacturer in China is not an impact on our gross margins today. We've just got those two lines up and running and producing, not producing sellable product yet, but we do have them producing product. And so those will start to factor into our COGS, either later this year or in early 2021. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic.\nShacey Petrovic: Thank you. In closing, I would like to acknowledge both National Diabetes Awareness Month and Insulet\u2019s 20th Anniversary since our company's founding. We've spent the last 20 years with a clear mission and improve the lives of people with diabetes. And over that time, we've brought advanced innovation to the diabetes community and helped people spend more time living their best life and let managing their chronic condition. So we're very proud of all we've done, and we're really excited about our innovations to come as we deliver on our mission. Thanks all. And have a great evening,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Shacey. Our third quarter marked a continuation of our strong performance, as we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth, including record quarterly revenue for our diabetes product lines. We've maintained a solid track record of performance, largely due to our loyal customers and the commitment and execution of our global Insulet team. We are steadily advancing our strategic imperatives and delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Turning to the third quarter financial results. We delivered 20% revenue growth ahead of our expectations and $9 million above our guidance range. Total OmniPod growth was 18%, which was the major driver of our outperformance at $6 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery revenue also finished ahead of our expectations with growth of 47%, which was $3 million above our guidance range. In our total OmniPod business, the pandemic was a smaller headwind than expected. It negatively impacted global new customer starts in both the second and third quarters. This creates a compounding impact on our revenue, which we began to see in the third quarter and we'll continue to see an impact into the fourth quarter and first half of 2021. Despite this headwind and as a result of our year-to-date strong results and continued execution, we now expect full year 2020 total OmniPod revenue growth to exceed our start of the year pre-COVID expectations. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance for new customer starts. We expect that the pandemic would lower our beginning of the year expectations by 30% to 50%. Our results were favorable in both the U.S. and international regions with the combined impact slightly less than 30%. Additionally, both the U.S. and international had significant sequential improvements resulting in approximately half of the impact in Q3 versus Q2. Attrition and utilization for total OmniPod were stable sequentially. Looking by product line, U.S. OmniPod revenue grew 21%, exceeding our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q3 revenue included a headwind of an approximate 4 million decrease in distributor channel inventory levels, partially offsetting estimated channel inventory built in the first half of the year, mainly due to the pandemic. Our strong growth was driven by further expansion of our customer base, increased OmniPod DASH adoption and the mix benefit from the shift to the pharmacy channel, including the premium on DASH where we provide the PDM to customers at no charge. In the third quarter, OmniPod DASH drove approximately 65% of our U.S. new customer starts. And we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total U.S. volume. International OmniPod revenue grew 12% compared to our guidance range of 9% to 11%, primarily due to better than expected new customer starts. Channel inventory growth in the quarter of an estimated 4 million to 5 million was primarily driven by stocking shipments of OmniPod DASH and with similar to the amount of estimated increased distributor orders we experienced in Q3 2019. Drug delivery revenue increased 47% compared to our guidance range of 23% to 28%. Similar to Q2, the overachievement was due to our partners' increased forecast related to the current environment. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 65%, up 80 basis points, exceeding our expectations. Key drivers of our gross margin expansion included improving performance of our U.S. manufacturing as we ramp our newly implemented automated lines as well as the favorable revenue mix from the shift to higher volume through the pharmacy channel. Also contributing was favorable product line mix. While positive foreign exchange was a 60 basis point tailwind, it was offset by a 60 basis point headwind from one-time COVID-related costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses in the third quarter were largely in line with our expectations on a dollar basis and slightly lower as a percentage of revenue given our strong top-line performance. Expenses increased on a dollar basis, primarily due to the marketing costs as well as R&D and clinical spend for OmniPod 5. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 18.1% in the third quarter, up from 15.4% in the prior year. Our profitability improvement benefited from operations with improved gross margins and operating expense leverage and the change in other income. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the third quarter with $897 million in cash and investments. Subsequent to Q3, we raised an additional $130 million of cash related to building and equipment financings as these type of arrangements helped to reduce our overall cost of capital. The additional cash further strengthens our position and allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives. Our investments are primarily to scale manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as for R&D programs, global commercial and sales force expansion and international product and geographic expansion. We are uniquely positioned to drive rapid growth by serving a large and underpenetrated market, and our strong cash position provides us with capital to further strengthen our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our revised outlook for 2020. As a result of third quarter revenue that exceeded expectations, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance to growth of 20% to 21%, up from our previous expectations of 17% to 19% and above our beginning of year estimate. This includes raising total OmniPod revenue to a range of 21% to 22%. Our total OmniPod growth rates are now back in line with our original guidance set at the start of the year pre-COVID, which is a testament to the resilience of our durable annuity model and the execution of our Insulet team. By product line, for U.S. OmniPod, we are raising our expected revenue growth to 23% to 24%. And for international OmniPod, we are raising our expectations to 18% to 19%. Although COVID to create uncertainties and it is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic or the probability of a resurgence, we now expect the global new customer starts for the full year of 2020 will improve to approximately 75% of our beginning of the year estimate. Despite the challenging environment, our global diabetes business remains well positioned to generate strong growth this year as well as in 2021 and beyond. Lastly, for drug delivery, we are updating our expected revenue growth to 4% to 6%, resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. As a result of our outperformance in the third quarter and stronger revenue outlook, we are raising our full year 2020 gross margin guidance to approximately 64%, up from approximately 63%. This includes the headwind of $9 million to $10 million or approximately 100 basis points of estimated one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $7 million to $10 million. We now expect 2020 capital expenditures will be below prior year levels due to projects coming in favorable to estimated spend and due to timing. Our long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plans remain unchanged. And we therefore expect capital expenditures to grow again next year to support scaling manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as advancements in our innovation pipeline and commercial and international expansion. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our previously stated 13% to 17% range. Turning to fourth quarter 2020 guidance. We now expect total company revenue growth of 7% to 11%. This includes total OmniPod revenue growth of 10% to 14%, which as a reminder, reflects the compounding of lower new customer starts from the prior two quarters related to the pandemic. By product line, we expect U.S. and international OmniPod revenue each to grow 10% to 14% and drug delivery to decline 17% to 23%. In terms of new customers, we now expect global new customer starts to improve in the fourth quarter to a range of 15% to 25%, less than our beginning of the year expectations. This compares to the 25% impact we guided to on our Q1 and Q2 calls. In conclusion, we achieved strong growth year-to-date despite the impact from the global pandemic. This speaks to the power of our differentiated market position through product innovation and durable recurring revenue model. Our innovation pipeline is strong and our financial position is sound. We are focused on finishing the year strong and building momentum as we enter 2021. Assuming market conditions stabilize next year, we remain on track to deliver our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin in the range of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue at the low end of mid-teens. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Hey, Brandon. It's Wayde. I can start with that one. And it's a good place to start actually because this is obviously a major driver in the business today, and it's really different in the U.S. and international, as you said. So if we talk about the U.S. first, we've been performing quite well in the U.S. And new customer starts have been below our beginning of year expectations in Q2 and Q3, but we've been building momentum in the business, and Q4 is going to be pretty close to Q4 in the prior year. And just a reminder, Q4 in the prior year was our all-time highest new customer starts. And so we get a really tough comp in Q4. But in the U.S., the momentum has been building. We've got a lot of things driving that momentum. DASH is still a primary driver for us. The move into Type 2 is still early. The pharmacy model with pay-as-you-go is working well. We've made investments in our commercial business and expanding the sales force. And then our teams have done a great job ramping the virtual training. So there's just a lot of positives that are somewhat offsetting those headwinds from new customer starts. And as a result, we still got double-digit growth in our guide. And so for the U.S., it's going to be pretty close. If we can get to the high end of our guide or even above, then new customer starts are going to be pretty strong for us in Q4. From an international standpoint, it's a different story. The recovery has been slower. And as you mentioned, we've seen recently a few countries going more back into a lockdown. And so in speaking with our field teams there, they do anticipate it's going to be more challenging. But what's different than Q2 when this really caught everybody by surprise is our teams are much more effective now, it's still staying in contact with their customers, finding ways to connect with them, and DASH is a great \u2013 it's just great timing for us to be launching DASH because it gives our teams an opportunity to still get those meetings with physicians and with customers. And so we do think that new customer starts will continue to be more of a headwind above or at the high end of this range for us, but our teams are doing a better job, and there is lots of momentum. I mentioned, DASH newly launched internationally, but we've made sales force expansion there and we're also expanding into new countries. And so there is a lot of momentum building in behind this pandemic. And so I think we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of the day, the anticipated headwinds to the extent we can, I mean, it's obviously very difficult to predict how much impact the pandemic will have, but we've built the assumption into the high end and low end of our guidance ranges. And just depending on how impactful it is, it should land us in the range. If we see something like Q2 again, that was pretty extreme, and I think that would be something that would probably push us out of the range. And on the numbers, Patrick, they have been quite small actually. I think you mentioned COBRA, but there has been many other options for people including Medicaid in the states or alternative insurance in the household. So we haven't seen that many people on the program. But having said that, we've always had financial assistance program and we've had several \u2013 quite a few people on that over the years. And so this is really an enhancement to that program, and we haven't met the number of people that we had on our original program yet. So it's not like it's been a significant pick-up at this point. But as Shacey said, we're really happy to have it in place. If we have current customers that can't afford the product given the current situation they're in, we're more than happy to backstop them and help them continue with their therapy until they can access it through normal channels again. Hey, Robbie. First of all, glad you brought up guidance. We're very happy that we chose to issue guidance back in Q2 at the front end of this pandemic. It was a big decision. But when we looked at the recurring revenue model that we're in and how that really defends against a one quarter impact, like the pandemic happened in Q2, and that we were going to see a potential new customer starts impacting us for a few quarters, it compounds. And so that it's really math and it's our new customer starts over a few quarters, they compound. Q4 ends up with three quarters, including Q2, which was the lowest in it. So that's why we have a bigger headwind in new customer starts in Q4 than we've seen. The comment on conservatism, I mean, I'll take that every time because we held guidance and we did it because we wanted to make sure people understood our business model and that we could articulate our business by putting the ground and adding additional metrics so we could talk to it. The major drivers of our business, like you said, are mostly volume. And our business is very much a volume business now. As we sell through the pharmacy, we start to get into more and more distribution channels. There will be other ways for people to access our product over time. So it definitely becomes a volume business. And so for us mix plays an important component today, moves as we move customers from our traditional DME and direct channels into the pharmacy. And the premium that we get for the pay-as-you-go model, because we're given the PDM for no charge, those are dynamics today. But they are far away by the volume increases in the business. Yes, I think, you just checked off the major ones, David. And let's start with COVID because this is one of the ones that's harder to predict for us, we've got this progression, we've seen a significant improvement from Q2 into Q3. We're expecting a pretty big step up in the U.S. At the high end of our guide, we're only a few percentage points off our beginning of your estimate and that was a pretty strong estimate. So we're anticipating pretty strong recovery in the U.S. If we get there, then it really is about how does COVID hit us in 2021. And that's the unknown. And we'll obviously know more after we get through Q4 and we're set up to give our 2021 guide. We always give our guide at our Q4 call. And so, we'll have a much better feel, I think, for what at least the early part of 2021 will look like in the U.S. Outside the U.S. international, we're seeing more and more lockdowns already here in the quarter. And so that's \u2013 we're so far we feel comfortable, we'll be in the range that we've provided for international, but again, next year it makes it a much more challenging thing. So, with, COVID, obviously that's a question mark. For the other drivers that you mentioned OmniPod 5, that one comes \u2013 first half of the year will be our limited market release and so we won't see a material impact until the second half of the year. So from a modeling standpoint, to your question, David, I would think about OmniPod 5, starting to ramp in the second half of the year. Gross margins, we were very happy to report just under 65. And I think we can think about the same for Q4, and that really sets us up for the 67 to 70 next year. We do have a lot of programs going. We announced recently that we've stood up another third party manufacturing plant in China. And so we're working our first two lines there to get sellable product. And so we've got a lot of things happening inside of that gross margin number, but they are all designed to get us set up so that we can increase capacity on a short-term basis if we need to. And at the same time we're ramping up the U.S. So I think we're squarely in that 67% to 70% range for next year. Depending on the volume and depending on how fast we ramp, we could be at the low end, but we could just as easily be at the high end. And so I think from a modeling standpoint gross margin is just right in that 67% to 70% range. From a mix standpoint, we'll continue to see the mix benefit less from the pharmacy channel. We're not done moving customers from the DME and direct side of the business, into the pharmacy and ramping up DASH. The one thing that's still a question mark for us there is, what we'll be pricing OmniPod 5 at and whether we'll have premium price or price parity there? So there's a few open questions, Dave, that we'll look to clarify when we get to our earnings \u2013 or pardon me, our guidance in our Q4 call. Sure. So I can start then on the sequential growth that you mentioned, David and you're right, you can see it in our growth rates. Q2 is the problem quarter. I mean, that was a quarter where we had significantly lower new customer starts and we start to live with that for four quarters. And that's the big one that we will annualize out of the business in Q1 next year. And adding new customer starts from Q2 into three and four. So, I think four obviously has three quarters of compounded impact to it and that's factored into our guidance. But that's what I wanted to just share and give perspective on all the momentum we have building inside the business, because there's so much things happening. And really our goal here is to come out of the other side of the pandemic with as much momentum as we can around our new product innovations, around our business model strategies with Type 2 and the pharmacy, as well as the investments we've made in the salesforce and the commercial business including virtual training, as well as Shacey mentioned the end to end customer process. And so there's just so many good things that this compounding new customer start is offsetting for us. And so it's really our job to build the momentum here. Come out the other side stronger. Is Q4 going to be the trough? I don't know yet we have to see what the pandemic impact is in Q4 and then what Q1 looks like. But we really don't annualize out that tough Q2 until we get to Q1 next year. Yes, it's still a question for us, Jeff. There's a lot of different opportunities for us across the U.S. in particular. But like you said, a major consideration for us is getting it sold to our customers as fast as possible. And we certainly take into consideration the current environment that we're in, other AID systems that are in the marketplace. And so now that there is a significant opportunity for us to get there faster. Having said that, even if we go at parity pricing there's a long process to work through and we've put the infrastructure in place, we've built up our access teams, we built up our wholesalers and distributors, and we've learned a lot through the ramp up of DASH. And so it really is still a question for us. Jeff it really just depends on how we want to approach the market. Lots of benefits obviously to price premium, but there are just as many benefits and a very compelling one from a customer standpoint, to get it into the hands of our current customers, and new customers. So yes, that one is still a jump off for us. Yes. And you're right, it is challenging. And I'll just highlight again, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to provide guidance. So give us an opportunity to share more about it and to provide enough data points. And sounds like Jeff, you're close. What I would say is the U.S. was a little stronger headwind than you laid out there, but Q4 is going to be getting pretty close against a really tough comp in Q4. The U.S. business has been performing really well. And despite the headwind it's been on the low end of our stated new customer starts headwind. And then internationally, little higher again than the estimates you put out there. Those are a little lower than we're experiencing from our estimates. And we do expect international to persist more into Q4. Right. You're correct. Our guidance is at greater than 30%. And just to clarify it is growing a couple of percentage points in our number. We just are keeping it rounded. So, as the quarters go quarter-to-quarter, we're probably not going to see major step-ups just given that our overall business grows as well. But as Shacey said, the majority of our new customers starts are on DASH. And DASH is primarily in the pharmacy. So we will continue to see the pharmacy volume grow over time. Why don't just ask some... Hi, Briana. Yes, you've actually touched on a couple of key drivers there. So the question was around mix COGS. And the key for us today is active manufacturing is a more expensive product because it's fairly low volumes on two lines in a plant that's designed for four automated lines. And a lot of the cost is fixed on the automated manufacturing lines. So today our production out of our Flex China facility is a lower cost than Acton. However, over time, it's designed that the automated manufacturing lines will be more efficient and get us this product. And that is as you mentioned, the single largest driver of improved gross margins for us over time. But in combination with that is scale. I think we are building significant, critical mass in the business here, as we accumulate more and more customers with our patch pump disposable design. And the investments that we've been making in manufacturing, both in the U.S. and in China, really build a critical mass of expertise, and know-how in how to do this. And as we scale and put volumes into it, those volumes help us drive gross margins significantly as well. And the new, third-party manufacturer in China is not an impact on our gross margins today. We've just got those two lines up and running and producing, not producing sellable product yet, but we do have them producing product. And so those will start to factor into our COGS, either later this year or in early 2021. Thank you."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll update you on our progress with our strategic imperatives, and then many reasons we are excited about the future. Wayde will discuss our financial results and outlook for the rest of this year, and then we'll open the call to your questions. We remain in challenging unprecedented times. The progress we've made despite this challenging environment, demonstrates the durability of our recurring revenue business model, OmniPod's differentiated form factor and the commitment and resilience of the Insulet team. Together, our team has cared for our users who need our support, advanced our innovation pipeline and delivered another remarkable quarter on all aspects of our business. We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 20%. Our U.S. and international OmniPod product lines, each achieved another record revenue quarter. New customer starts were stronger than expected, and we now expect to deliver our fifth consecutive year of 20% revenue growth despite the pandemic. We also expect to finish 2020 above our pre-COVID expectations at the start of the year. While delivering strong performance, we are also building a foundation to drive adoption in our enormous and growing market over the long-term. In just the markets we currently serve, there are approximately 10 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes, who could benefit from improved quality of life and better outcomes with OmniPod. This market opportunity will grow significantly as we move into new geographies, expand awareness and access to our technologies and bring our game-changing consumer-oriented innovations to market. Our highest \u2013 our long-term growth will be supported by the manufacturing expertise required to produce the highest quality products, while increasing gross margins. We are investing in each of these areas to build enduring advantages that will enable us to improve the lives of people with diabetes for many years to come. I'll start with expanding access and awareness. We are establishing market access so OmniPod is easily available regardless of age, type of diabetes or payer. Our access through the U.S. pharmacy channel offers customers an unusually simple onboarding experience. Benefit checks are swift. Co-pays are low and don't come with a large one-time cost. And virtual training is quick and effective. While COVID-19 has presented challenges, it also has pushed us to embrace virtual training, which is now preferred by users and providers. We expect these newly developed capabilities to continue to provide value as we scale our business. Approximately 80% of our new customers in the third quarter were multiple daily injection users attracted to OmniPod's ease-of-use and unique form factor. Additionally, approximately one-third of our U.S. new customers were Type 2, up from last quarter. Fueling the success with MDI and Type 2 is OmniPod DASH. Since launched 18 months ago, awareness of OmniPod DASH's unparalleled simplicity has grown and we have built a broad pharmacy access in the United States. By the end of Q3, we had secured coverage for 65% to 70% of covered lives for OmniPod DASH. With OmniPod DASH in the pharmacy, MDI users no longer pay large upfront costs or get locked into a four-year contract to try an insulin pump. They can start on OmniPod with a free trial and no lock-in period. We are thrilled to be knocking down barriers and enabling OmniPod to bring improved quality of life and outcomes to more people with diabetes. In our progress on establishing broad market access through the pharmacy channel, the time was right to launch a small-scale direct-to-consumer advertising pilot. We launched the pilot in September and have been learning a ton. While we know our DTC is working to raise awareness, we are still monitoring key performance metrics, such as lead conversion rates and retention of DTC-generated customers. We know increased awareness is key to growing adoption, and we are delighted to be in such a strong position to invest and explore this area. While our world has been challenged with the pandemic, our team has not missed a beat in advancing our innovation pipeline. OmniPod 5 is the world's first tubeless wearable AID system and the only one fully controlled by a user's mobile phone. With OmniPod 5, we will give our customers freedom, simplicity and integration with personal consumer technology like no other system on the market today. Our automated insulin delivery platform is transformative technology with potential applications in a variety of segments. And our initial launch of OmniPod 5 for Type 1 diabetes users aged seven plus, marks our first step. We are excited about the impact it will make in the market and on the lives of people with diabetes. Over time, we will be investing in clinical studies to first explore and then prove OmniPod 5's utility in more market segments. We are thrilled to have recently completed our OmniPod 5 pivotal trial and remain on track to launch in the first half of this coming year. While our team prepares for FDA submission, virtually all of the trial participants have transitioned into a pivotal extension phase. They will remain on product and provide us with critical additional data to support OmniPod 5's value proposition with payers and with clinicians. This data will also help inform our future innovations beyond OmniPod 5. We are excited to share our clinical results. And given ATTD has been delayed, we are evaluating the best alternative to do so. Our OmniPod 5 pre-school pivotal study with two to six year olds is under way with all 80 participants on product. OmniPod ranks number one within this demographic, and we are delighted to have kicked off our pivotal study to make OmniPod 5 available down to age two. Our goal is to have the expanded indication by the end of 2021 for this young population and their caregivers. Additionally, following the FDA's acceptance of our Type 2 clinical study protocol, in September, we began enrollment. This feasibility study will include 30 to 40 participants, each wearing OmniPod 5 for approximately two months. As we learn more from our growing Type 2 user base, we know there is a large market for an appropriate Type 2 AID system. We are confident an OmniPod AID system will provide great value for the Type 2 population, and we expect our early clinical work will result in important learnings. OmniPod's form factor, our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy and our experience developing exceptionally simple products position us uniquely to grow pod use month Type 2 users. While we prepare for OmniPod 5's submission and commercial launch, we are also making progress on our future products. We are advancing our collaborations with Dexcom and Abbott who are rapidly and meaningfully raising awareness of diabetes technology among Type 1 and Type 2 users. CGM is helping users recognize that they need better insulin delivery solutions. And CGM adoption is paving the way for generations of OmniPod products to meet these needs. In addition to integration with our next generation sensors, we have exciting work under way to make OmniPod 5 compatible with iOS. And we continue to advance our algorithm to expand our lead in simplicity and ease-of-use. Now, turning to our progress in our international markets. We have seen a gradual recovery in our European markets. And in September, we announced the full commercial rollout of OmniPod DASH. Our teams have done a remarkable job preparing our markets to support this launch, and our customers are loving the product. Now 100% of our new customers in Europe start on OmniPod DASH. In September, we announced the start of our geographic expansion efforts, and we are on track to enter five new markets by early 2021. We're taking a deliberate approach to our international expansion as we build our capabilities in each market and leverage our existing teams and strong distributor relationships. While it will take time to broaden our presence, over the longer term, our expanded global footprint will significantly increase our total addressable market. Finally, turning to operational excellence. In order to meet the growing demand for OmniPod, we are increasing capacity in both the United States and China. We are making considerable progress with the ramp of our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. And we are nearing completion of our third line installation, which we expect will produce sellable product next year. We have also made an investment in another contract manufacturer in China, allowing us to leverage our local supplier base and highly experienced team to quickly scale. These investments strengthen our global manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure that over the long-term we have the capacity and redundancy to meet increased global demand for our products. In summary, the world remains challenged with the impact of the global pandemic. However, the compelling benefits of OmniPod, the uniqueness and durability of our recurring revenue model and the outstanding execution of our team provide significant insulation for Insulet. We delivered strong financial and operational performance, and we are taking the appropriate steps to expand our innovation pipeline, grow our addressable markets and enhance our global manufacturing capabilities. Our team is focused on finishing the year strong and sustaining our momentum as we move toward launch of OmniPod 5 in the first half of 2021. And most importantly, we remain focused on improving the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Sure. Thanks, Brendan, for the question. And I think what we had said at the beginning of this year is that we did expect to see continued improvement throughout the year and then we were hoping for normalization in 2021. And I don't want to sort of predict what's going to happen in 2021, but I think it's great to see where we are now predicting to close this year, because it means we're ahead of what we expected in terms of the potential impact of COVID. And regardless of what happens with the vaccine and the macro environment, our teams are getting great at managing and making an impact in this environment, and that's because of some of the things that Wayde just mentioned, our virtual training tools and various capabilities that we've built. In terms of OmniPod 5, that is a product that we have spent so much design work and thinking and organizational focus on simplicity and ensuring that everything from the onboarding experience through to the use experience of the system is simple. And it is designed to be a product that \u2013 and it's simple enough that MDI users and kids can easily get on to and be successful with. So I don't anticipate that COVID is going to slow us down. There is just incredible enthusiasm in the market and internally with all of us to get that product on to the market, and we're going to make that happen regardless of what's happening in the macro environment. Thank you. Sure, Patrick. I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit more color on utilization of the program. But at a high level, I'll say that it's something that I think we as a company are very proud of and that we were out front and able to offer this assistance to our users. This is very much about ensuring that while COVID is negatively impacting in an outsized fashion our partners that they can remain on product. And so we're proud of the program and our intent is to \u2013 we were committed through the end of this year. If we feel like that need may persist, then we will certainly evaluate continuing the program. Sure. Patrick, it's funny, you're asking the questions that we're asking ourselves internally. I mean, one of the reasons why we wanted to do DTC this year before launching OmniPod 5 is that we really wanted to learn about the impact, learn about the messaging that's most effective, the channels that are most effective. We've been expanding our DTC over the last couple of years through digital channels, but this is the first time that we've really stuck our toe into television. And it's clear from the early numbers that we've made an impact on awareness. It certainly is driving increased awareness. And what we are looking at now is just how does that awareness convert into actual customers over what period of time and to what degree. And then are those customers \u2013 because remember, we have eliminated all barriers to getting on the product. Patient can get on to OmniPod in the pharmacy without any upfront cost and basically with a free trial. And so we want to make sure that those patients stay on the product to the extent that our customer base does. So those are the things that we're evaluating before we determine to what extent we increase our investment in DTC in 2021. And our plan is to give a bit more color on the next call when we're bringing and we should have learned more by then and have a better point of view in terms of expanding. But I think what's exciting is that now that we have the position that we have in the pharmacy channel, we actually have the scale and the position to kind of support increased demand. And so that is really exciting to us in the DME channel, getting patients through the process and onto the product is a bit more cumbersome. And for patients to be able to walk into the pharmacy, get the product, have no upfront cost and have that sort of easy onboarding experience, is the right time to start to learn more about DTC. And we're encouraged and stay tuned. Yes, I think those are great questions and I think really highlight why we're so excited about OmniPod 5. You see the growth that we're driving, Wayde said, in Q4, in the U.S., we could be back to a, all-time record quarter at the high end of our guidance for new patients. So we're seeing a great recovery. That recovery is being driven as it's, frankly always has been off of OmniPod's form factor. 80% of new users are coming from MDI. So we continue to grow the overall market and that's being driven by OmniPod factor by pharmacy access in both Type 1 and Type 2 MDI users. That is a population that is just very attracted to DASH and its simplicity. I think we'll continue to see that segment adopt OmniPod based on its form factor and based on the out-of-pocket economics. Actually in the pharmacy channel, the vast majority of our patients are accessing OmniPod for less than a $50 co-pay. So it's very economic. It's very attractive in terms of form factor and the access channel and so those are driving demand today. I think what you are highlighting is why we \u2013 people are so excited about OmniPod 5 is that you can really see the power of integration with the Dexcom sensor and AID. And up until the next few months when we get, or the next several months, when we get OmniPod 5 out into the market, patients have had to choose between what we know is a preferred form and integration with the Dexcom sensor. And obviously, in the first half of 2021, they'll no longer have to choose. And so I'm not going to make predictions on exactly how that's going to change our trends. I think we certainly expect it to be an accelerator. And I think the question is what changes in terms of MDI users coming on to the product, or do we see more pump users coming onto the product, because remember they can adopt OmniPod 5 without any cost and without a four-year lock-in period. So we're really excited to basically check every box that patients are looking for in terms of an insulin delivery system and an AID system in particular with OmniPod 5. Yes, thanks Robbie. We are evaluating that. We had a great forum with ATTD and our clinical investigators being invited to share the data. But obviously we were just recently notified that it's been delayed till May. So we're looking to see other appropriate forums for us to get it out there. And there's just a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, the most important thing is that we get FDA clearance and get to launch top of next year. So we don't want to get the data out ahead of that and maybe ruffle feathers at the FDA. So we're looking at our options and we certainly understand, and we're enthusiastic to get it out there as soon as possible. But I don't have specifics to provide today. And David, on your question on OmniPod 5, I think, it's a great question. And one we're looking forward to sort of seeing the answer in, in 2021. I guess I get most excited about the MDI users that are converting. Because if you think about what's happening today, nobody chooses, at least our data would indicate that nobody chooses a tubed pump because it has tubes. They choose it over OmniPod when they do, because it has a Dexcom integration. And so when we check that box and we obviously believe OmniPod 5 will be significantly differentiated, can be easier to use. And we think about key features like phone control, like constant access to data and all the other things that I've spoken about. When we check that box, should get a much larger \u2013 plus already today we get a very large percent of MDI conversions we should get a much larger one. So that to me is probably the biggest opportunity. Because if you think about the capital equipment model, some of those folks, most of those folks are locked into a four-year contract. And so 25% of them will come up. And I think it'll be interesting to see in that population, what happens in terms of adoption for OmniPod 5. But that's an area where we're a little less familiar with because we get less patients from that area today. What we know for sure is that MDI users are going to be very, very attracted to OmniPod 5. And when we check the box of integration and automation with Dexcom, that's going to be a very differentiated and appealing product. Great. Maybe I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit of insight into the overall expectations for international growth. But there's nothing fundamental in the business that would change our long-term expectations for that business. It's just simply that we're in the midst of a pandemic and that there's been a slower recovery, in particularly Europe, than other parts of the world and particularly in the United States. So we remain very bullish on our expansion strategy over the long-term. And it's why I mentioned in my remarks that we're really starting in earnest our expansion in early 2021. And over time, this adds significant addressable market to us over the coming years. We didn't give the five markets. So we'll lay those out for you as we enter into them. We did get one checked off the box this quarter in Belgium. So actually one of the best entered. And we will let you know as we enter these markets, that those launches have occurred. And then I \u2013 sorry had also asked Larry about OmniPod 5 in international. We haven't given a timeline on that yet. Just to let everybody know that that work is underway and we are fully committed to bringing OmniPod 5, to our European markets and to all of our international markets. Sure, thanks Larry. And we don't \u2013 our practice to notify or become public when we submit, we simply share the news when we're cleared. So that's our general practice. In terms of the data, I really don't have much insight to offer there. We don't want to preview it. Obviously the pre pivotal data looked very, very strong and we are very excited to get the OmniPod pivotal data out there, but I don't want to give insight into just how it compares at this point. Thanks Larry. Sure, Joanne. I don't have the total population of two to six-year-olds in the market. It's obviously a really important population for us. Not necessarily because of the size of the population, but because we know that when people adopt OmniPod they stay with us. So we've always been strategically focused on the young pediatric population. And it's also a population where OmniPod is heavily, heavily differentiated for a variety of reasons. It's a much easier technology to use on young active children. So we're excited about getting everybody enrolled in our clinical trial and getting that label expansion ideally before the end of next year. In terms of milestones for OmniPod 5, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the company, as we think about ramping towards the OmniPod launch. We have obviously the clinical data analysis, and presentation and publication of the data, so that will be a milestone as we move forward. We have IT and commercial work going on to look at establishing our easy onboarding systems for OmniPod 5. We have market access work. So obviously we will start to build reimbursement in the pharmacy channel for OmniPod 5. And then we have a ton of work going on in medical affairs, et cetera. And then of course we have the cross-functional team working on a submission, which is going to be somewhere around 30,000 to 40,000 pages. So almost every individual function in the company is touching the OmniPod 5 launch in some way. And so lots of milestones happening internally in terms of our commercial progress, our manufacturing progress and our clinical progress. The next thing that we'll really announce is probably the data and then the clearance of the system. And so those are the things to look for kind of publicly externally. And you mentioned, is it a limited market release, is it a full market release? We've always maintained that we will do a limited market release. It's a high stakes product for us. We know it's the most anticipated innovation in the pipeline of all diabetes products. And so we want to get it right and a limited market release as part of doing that. So when we launch in the first half of 2021, we will launch into a limited market release. How long that will be, I think, remains to be seen because it depends upon when we're meeting our end points and our objectives for a limited market release. And that will be based on market access, manufacturing ramp, and customer feedback. Sure. Thanks. Hey Ryan, maybe I'll let Wayde talk about the specific numbers in terms of the pharmacy channel, but I would say that momentum is very strong in the pharmacy channel, access continues to increase. And we do expect that OmniPod 5 should be a catalyst in terms of pharmacy conversions because it really is going to be a pharmacy product. And so that we are committed to, we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And we know there's a lot of demand building for the technology. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, so in terms of overall pump utilization in Type 2s, it's still pretty low penetration, and there's just a massive opportunity to go get with Type 2s. We see CGM as sort of a beachhead, right. As CGM adoption happens, which is happening, is very maturely happening and in Type 1, but just really getting going in Type 2. And we see that as a trend, as you said, bodes well for pump adoption. Other pumps are challenged from an access perspective. So we are very fortunate to be in the pharmacy channel, providing the pay-as-you-go model. That's really what's driving access and availability of OmniPod to the Type 2 population. So we know we've got a really appealing product. We know that the technology adoption curve for CGM is helping to drive this. But we are in a unique position, in terms of our channel and in terms of our form factor and OmniPod's discretion and ease of use to be able to win in that market. And so I think we are winning, right now we're winning primarily with MDI conversions, not other pumps. And I would be surprised if other pumps are seeing the level of conversion that we're seeing in Type 2s. And we're testing a bunch of different messages in DTC. So we do have actually messaging that is geared towards the Type 2 population. Too early at this point to be able to give a color on that. But as I said, as we lay out our expectations for 2021, we'll be able to give insight into DTC and what we expect that that's going to drive for us. Yes, Travis, I'm sorry, you broke up there. So we didn't fully \u2013 you were a little garble, there were some interference. If you could repeat your question, that would be great. Okay, great, OmniPod 5 Type 2 feasibility study. So that is the first step in terms of our clinical exploration for Type 2s on OmniPod 5. So you may remember we did feasibility studies for Type 1 with OmniPod 5 as well. This really is a step in the eventual label expansion. And it's an early step. So, we will get 30 to 40 users on the product. We will look to see, does the algorithm perform as we would expect it to, for this segment, or do we need to tweak the algorithm? Remember, when we did our early feasibility studies with OmniPod 5, in the Type 1 population, we did a lot of work on the algorithm, a tremendous amount of work on the algorithm to deliver the performance that we saw in the pre-pivotals. Remember we had best-in-class hypoglycemia, we had great time and range, particularly with kids that came from just a lot of tweaking of the algorithm. And so we may need to do the same thing in the Type 2 population that remains to be seen. Feasibility study will give us those learnings. It will then map out for us how much clinical work do we have. And then we'll be able to determine what's the path for label expansion. In terms of reimbursement, we're fortunate in the pharmacy channel there really isn't a distinction between the Type 1 and Type 2 user. And so with label expansion that should pave the way for access in the pharmacy channel for a Type 2. Yes, I think it's a good point. And we mentioned in the U.S. everything is getting more efficient and more effective working in this environment. Of course, we've talked a lot about the virtual tools for training and support that we've rolled out we really have built a lot of confidence and preference among our clinicians and our patients for that pathway of training. And so even as certain areas experience more challenges with the pandemic, we're able to continue to bring new patients onto the product. And so in the U.S., as Wayde said, we're feeling pretty good, right. The high end of our guidance in Q4 would indicate that we're going to be at a record quarter in Q4. So that's great. Outside of the U.S., it's a more fragmented and more challenged environment right now. And we still see that our virtual tools and the capabilities that we've built are certainly helping to ensure that we can continue to bring patients on. But as we have the UK heading back into a shelter-in-place, France, those are a little bit more challenged environments for us. And France in particular is a large market for us. So it's not like Q2. We certainly still see progression in terms of improved new patients starts outside of the U.S. and even in these more challenged markets. But there definitely is a headwind there that doesn't exist in the United States. Thank you. In closing, I would like to acknowledge both National Diabetes Awareness Month and Insulet's 20th Anniversary since our company's founding. We've spent the last 20 years with a clear mission and improve the lives of people with diabetes. And over that time, we've brought advanced innovation to the diabetes community and helped people spend more time living their best life and let managing their chronic condition. So we're very proud of all we've done, and we're really excited about our innovations to come as we deliver on our mission. Thanks all. And have a great evening,"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today for Insulet second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website, and the press release discussing our second quarter 2020 results and third quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis, and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While COVID-19 continues to challenge Insulet, our customers and our communities around the world. The dedication of our employees, partners and the healthcare providers, serving people with diabetes, helped us to deliver an extraordinary quarter on nearly every dimension. We achieved second quarter revenue of over $226 million, exceeding our expectations. This growth represented a 29% increase driven by 27% revenue growth in our total Omnipod product line. And it was a record revenue quarter across every single product line. Delivering these results in such uncertain times is a testament to the tremendous execution of our team. We are very fortunate to have strong fundamentals in place. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation. Our performance in the first half of this year is reflective of our great momentum in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. While we are seeing an impact of COVID, it\u2019s a two-part story for Insulet. There are many aspects of our performance that we celebrate. We are creating new ways to serve our customers that are more scalable and more engaging. We\u2019re making our supply chain and manufacturing operations more resilient and adding significant capacity in preparation for the Omnipod 5 launch next year. And even in the face of this pandemic, we are making exciting progress on our innovation programs. In the near-term, due to COVID impact on new starts, we have the reality of the compounding impact on our revenue growth rates in the second half of this year and the first half of next. But ultimately, we expect to grow total Omnipod revenue 18% to 20% in 2020, despite this impact. And we are building capabilities across the company to maximize our position in the market and serve our mission for many years to come. Insulet will emerge stronger and better from this challenge, thanks to our talented and committed team. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to speak about how we are continuing to manage through the COVID environment, our achievements toward our strategic imperatives and our longer term expectations. Wayde will dive into the details of our financial results and guidance, and we will then take questions. We continue to grow our global customer base during the second quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had anticipated 50% to 75% fewer new Omnipod customers as compared to our original expectations at the start of the year. We landed closer to 50% exceeding our expectations. Our performance was driven by our commercial teams who throughout the quarter expanded utilization of our virtual onboarding tools, piloted novel programs to increase awareness and adoption of Omnipod and continue to expand affordable access to Omnipod across the globe. And it was supported by our innovation and operations teams who helped us to grow our manufacturing capacity and resilience and deliver an exciting new release of Omnipod DASH, while also advancing Omnipod 5 towards commercial launch. This quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. One, to deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization. Starting with consumer-focused innovation. The Omnipod form factor has been our key advantage since our founding. We hear from Podders around the world who come to us from MDI and other pumps that the ease of use and the freedom associated with the pod is life-changing. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve benefited from the differentiated form factor and increasing market access to grow our Omnipod customer base. Last year, we fully launched Omnipod DASH and our growth accelerated, even as other CGM integrated automated insulin delivery systems came to market. This is a testament to the value of our consumer-focused innovation, including relentless focus on ease of use, companion apps and cloud connectivity. And it is a testament to the compelling form factor of Omnipod. In a few quarters, users will no longer have to choose between the Omnipod form factor and CGM integrated automated insulin delivery. Omnipod 5 offers both. Adoption of Omnipod DASH continues to grow, driven by both the ease of use of the platform and our pay-as-you-go business model, primarily through the pharmacy channel in the United States. This is a uniquely differentiated offering that eliminates restrictions and makes treatment accessible to a broader range of customers. We continue to see strong adoption among MDI users in both the type 1 and type 2 segments. In the second quarter, approximately 30% of our U.S. new Omnipod customers were typed 2 consistent with last quarter. We continue to make great strides within the type 2 diabetes population. A market we are uniquely positioned to serve, given our differentiated product and our access through the pharmacy with no restrictions and no upfront costs. Coverage for Omnipod DASH continues to expand with approximately 65% of lives now covered, primarily through the pharmacy channel. In June, we also launched a major Omnipod DASH release, including several features that further improve simplicity and ease of use. These include automatic data uploads so that users and their clinicians have instant real-time cloud access to data without the need to connect and download from a computer. We have been working on that vision for years to streamline clinic workflow. And we have already heard from users how valuable this is to enable telehealth visits in our current environment. We can also now push future software updates wirelessly to our customers. And we are delighted to now offer Spanish language as an option for Omnipod DASH users in the United States. In the second quarter, we saw expanding use of our virtual patient onboarding tools, which have been well received by consumers and healthcare providers. The vast majority of our new customers were onboarded virtually. Omnipod simplicity and ease of use are clearly differentiated in this environment and both type 1 and type 2 MDI users can easily get started on Omnipod from the comfort of their homes. Our virtual training capabilities have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID on growth of new Omnipod customers. And they also lay a foundation for consumer-friendly, cost-effective and scalable onboarding of new users to Omnipod 5 when it launches. In addition to the success we\u2019re having with Omnipod DASH, we made great progress on Omnipod 5 and remain on track to launch in the first half of next year. We resumed our pivotal study in June and presented our first data from the Omnipod 5 pre-pivotal study at the American Diabetes Association Virtual Conference. The results demonstrated best-in-class usability and time and closed loop, excellent time and range and statistically significant improvements in hypoglycemia compared to prior therapy. More than half of the participants have completed the Omnipod 5 pivotal study, and all participants should finish by Q4 putting us in a solid position to launch Omnipod 5 in the first half of 2021. Virtually all cryo participants have enthusiastically requested to continue using Omnipod 5. So we are supporting an extension phase to enable them to remain on product. This allows us to collect additional longer term data, which will be helpful insights for clinicians, payers and for our Omnipod 5 innovation pipeline. Participant feedback has been terrific. Just last week, we were touched to hear from a parent who said \u201cwith Omnipod 5, I now have my child back, and my family has their mom back\u201d. We know that we\u2019re third to market, and as such, we didn\u2019t design Omnipod 5 just to be an incremental improvement automated insulin delivery. We designed our system to revolutionize insulin delivery for people living with Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, and to bring AID to millions of people still relying on multiple daily injections. Omnipod 5 brings together the pods compelling form factor, excellent time and range, low hypoglycemia, customizable set points, and adaptively that is designed to limit the extent to which HCPs need to tweak the system to help users get great outcomes. Our platform will also offer unique benefits, including complete personal smartphone control, which eliminates the need for a separate PDM. Thanks to our effort to put the algorithm on the pod, we expect users to be able to download the Omnipod 5 app, pair with their pod and enjoy the benefits of Omnipod; no infusion sets, no separate controller and nothing else to think about. We also know that smartphone control isn\u2019t for everyone, but we wanted to ensure that our users could enjoy the benefits of real-time data being available in our companion apps and cloud data platform. Omnipod 5 PDMs will therefore include a SIM card. This enables every Omnipod user, even pediatrics without smartphones, and those without Wi-Fi to benefit from our companion apps that will provide real-time insulin and CGM data to caregivers, loved ones and clinicians. And all of this comes in a system that has been designed to be exceptionally easy to start and easy to use as evidenced by our remarkably high usability scores. We\u2019ve also begun to work on what comes after Omnipod 5. We see the Type 1 pump market nearly doubling in the coming years as more users discover the ease of use and clinical benefits of second generation AID systems like Omnipod 5 and beyond. And we see enormous opportunity to serve those living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, given our unique form factor and pharmacy access. So we are investing to serve these growing markets. We are investing in next generation technologies and in demonstrating the benefits of Omnipod 5 in expanding populations, including very young pediatrics and people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. We are advancing our algorithm to increase automation, improve outcomes and further simplify the experience for users. And we are continuing to integrate our products with next generation technologies from our partners at Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool, all with the goal to reduce burden and improve outcomes for the millions of people living with insulin dependent diabetes across the globe. Now turning to our progress in our international markets; this area of our business has been more heavily impacted by the pandemic and we are seeing a slower recovery in some European markets. This does not diminish our enthusiasm for our international opportunity, both in terms of continued growth in our existing markets and expansion into others with significant unmet need. We made good progress throughout the quarter, preparing our markets for the expansion of our Omnipod DASH launch. Our limited market release in the UK, Netherlands and Italy was successful and our customers love the product. The international team has been focused on training, market readiness and launch preparations, and we\u2019re looking forward to moving into full market release with Omnipod DASH early next year. And finally, turning to operational excellence; for the last four years, we have been strengthening our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We have increased capacity and made our operations more resilient with the addition of our U.S. manufacturing plant to compliment our facility in China. This has served us especially well during the current pandemic. As many of you know, during the last 15 months, we began producing Omnipod on our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. Although the pandemic has had an impact on how quickly we\u2019ve been able to ramp these lines, we continue to increase capacity and gain efficiencies throughout our global operations. In the near-term, this ensures we can deliver the highest quality product to each and every one of our customers. Over the long-term, our U.S. manufacturing will provide required capacity and support as demand for our products continues to grow. We plan to further expand our U.S. manufacturing capacity across our supply chain and manufacturing operations, to prepare for what we are confident will be enthusiastic demand for Omnipod 5. As part of our corporate sustainability goals, we have taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of our supply chain and operations. To this end, we have localized a large portion of our supply chain to reduce logistics emissions. We also moved to ocean freight, which has the benefit of being both cost \u2013 more cost effective and more environmentally friendly. In June, as a further step, we transitioned our company headquarters and U.S. manufacturing facility to be fully powered by solar-based renewable energy. We understand the urgency and importance to protect our environment and reduce our carbon footprint. And we are committed to fostering a sustainable business to support the long-term wellbeing of our customers, our employees and our communities. In summary, while there are certainly short-term challenges that our business faces due to COVID, our team is rising to these challenges in remarkable ways. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation and differentiation and are key to our ability to continue to deliver attractive growth in these uncertain times. Our investments in product and business model innovations and our talented dedicated team, position us over the long-term to drive strong organic growth and value creation and to bring powerful new technologies to market; and most importantly, to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thank you. I want to echo Shacey\u2019s gratitude to our Insulet team members who have adapted to these extraordinary times. Thanks to their hard work, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We continue to make excellent progress on our strategic imperatives as we invest for growth, enhance our global competitive differentiation and serve our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes. In the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 29%, which was $10 million above our guidance range. This strong performance continues to be fueled by our total Omnipod growth of 27% and was $6 million above our guidance range. Regarding new Omnipod starts, we communicated that our guidance for Q2 included an estimate that the pandemic would lower our expectations from the beginning of the year by 50% to 75% with the U.S. closer to 50% and international closer to 75%. Actual Q2 results were favorable in both regions, as the combined impact was approximately 50%. Attrition and utilization came in near expected levels with slightly higher attrition and slightly lower utilization. Breaking down our revenue results by product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 31% exceeding our guidance range of 21% to 25%. Approximately $4 million to $5 million of the increase resulted from the net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels. In Q2, we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total volume. Pharmacy channel growth contributed to the increased inventory levels. Stocking for the pandemic also drove channel inventory increases across all three channels, including our DME and Direct. New Omnipod starts were also favorable versus our expectations. Our growing customer base and Omnipod DASH adoption primarily through the pharmacy channel, as well as the mixed benefit from the premium on DASH, continued to be the primary drivers of our growth. In the second quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH continued to drive over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts. International Omnipod revenue grew 20% compared to our range of 15% to 19%, including a benefit of approximately $2 million of channel inventory build due to COVID and to a lesser extent, better than expected new Omnipod starts. Drug delivery revenue increased 49% to $24 million, which was $4 million above our guidance range. While we expected greater than normal revenue growth in Q2 resulting from the shift in timing of production from Q1, the overachievement was due to our partners increased forecast related to the current environment. Overall, we achieved robust revenue growth in the second quarter building off of our strong momentum from 2019 and Q1 of 2020. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 63%, down 270 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations. The year-over-year change, included headwinds primarily due to the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing lines, as well as an approximate 180 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-related costs and 40 basis points from foreign exchange. These headwinds were partially offset by the favorable revenue mix benefit from Omnipod DASH growth through the pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model with no upfront charge for the PDM, as well as continued improvements throughout our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. Operating expenses in the second quarter were in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 20%. Our strong adjusted EBITDA was due to the favorable revenue performance, lower travel and meeting expenses and timing of certain expenses, including Omnipod 5 clinical trial expenses, much of which moved from the second quarter into the third quarter. Regarding cash and liquidity, we are in a strong cash position with the earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the second quarter with $868 million in cash and investments, including the additional cash raise of $477 million from the equity offering in May. The cash raise strengthen our balance sheet and ensures we can continue to invest for growth, including R&D, commercial and capital expenditures in order to execute our strategic imperatives and provide additional liquidity during the pandemic, should we need it. We have a differentiated position in a large and under-penetrated market, and we want to come out of this pandemic stronger by continuing to grow in our global markets. Turning to guidance. Although COVID impacts are not predictable, last quarter we continue to provide guidance in order to help investors forecast our business, understand our growth drivers and highlight the areas of the business that will be most impacted. Given the information we had and an estimate of the impact of the macro indicators, along with the durability of our recurring revenue model, we maintained our full year 2020 revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range. As a result of second quarter revenue that exceeded expectations and a stronger second half outlook, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance growth rate to a range of 17% to 19% up from our previous expectation of 15%. This includes raising total Omnipod to a range of 18% to 20%. By product line for U.S. Omnipod, we\u2019re raising our expected revenue growth to 19% to 21%. And for international Omnipod, we\u2019re raising our expectations to 17% to 19%. The key drivers of our increased full year guidance for total Omnipod are the compounding benefit of second quarter hire new Omnipod starts, which add incremental revenue in the second half of the year and our expectations of improved new Omnipod starts in the third quarter. In terms of expected new Omnipod starts, our guidance now assumes an improvement in the third quarter, global new starts compared to our guide last quarter. We now estimate that new starts will be approximately 30% to 50% lower than our beginning of year estimate with the U.S. again at the low end and international near the high end. This compares to the 50% we guided to on our Q1 call. We anticipate fourth quarter global new starts will still be approximately 25% lower, consistent with last quarter\u2019s guide. This results in the achievement of approximately 60% to 75% of our original pre-COVID assumptions at the start of the year. Our revised guidance of new Omnipod starts factors in a gradual improvement from Q2 to year end. We continue to assume downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for potential pandemic related headwinds. While current trends are beginning to show signs of improving conditions, COVID continues to create uncertainties and it is difficult to accurately predict the progression Of the pandemic. Our global diabetes business remains well positioned to manage through multiple scenarios and continue strong growth this year, as well as in 2021 and over the long-term. Lastly, for drug delivery, we now anticipate growth of 3% to 6% resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. On a full year basis, we are reaffirming gross margin of approximately 63%, which includes an estimated $7 million to $10 million of one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $5 million to $10 million. Also factored in is the slower ramp in our U.S. manufacturing lines due to the pandemic. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with last year, as we plan to invest for growth in our innovation pipeline, global commercial initiatives and with our manufacturing and supply chain operations. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, we are reaffirming our expectation as a percentage of revenue at the low end of the 13% to 17% range. For the third quarter of 2020, we are guiding to total company revenue growth of 13% to 15%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 12% to 14%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod growth of 14% to 16%, international Omnipod of 9% to 11% and drug delivery of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, the pandemics impact on our global new starts in the second quarter has a compounding effect on revenue, which mostly impacts the second half of the year. Nevertheless, the durability of our differentiated recurring revenue model insulates us to a large degree, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base. As a result, we still plan to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter of 2020 and the full year, despite the impact of COVID. For our 2021 outlook, assuming market conditions stabilized in 2021, we remain on track to deliver our long range plan target of $1 billion in revenue. As communicated on our Q1 earnings call, we expect gross margin of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid teens, closer to the low end of the range. In conclusion, we had significant momentum to start the year and our first half 2020 results benefited from that momentum. Our differentiated business model and product platform, operational excellence and strong financial profile enable us to continue to invest for growth, while mitigating the impacts of COVID and related headwinds. As a result, we expect to deliver 18% to 20% revenue growth this year. We have a very healthy and robust business and are well positioned for continued growth over the long-term. With that, we\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. Shacey, just one on Omnipod 5 for you and Wayde one for you on the margin. So Shacey, just any update on the timeline for iOS integration and how are you feeling about price premium for Omnipod 5 versus DASH? And Wayde, on the 2021 gross margin, can you talk about the drivers to that 67% to 70%? Should we be thinking about the low end? It\u2019s a pretty big step up from a 63% in 2020. Thanks for taking the questions guys.\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Thanks, Larry. So in terms of iOS, we have not guided any timeframe there, only to say, that we fully expect to follow our initial launch on Android with iOS. So that work is underway and is that timeline becomes more clear, we\u2019ll communicate that out. First, we want to get Omnipod 5 to market, which is coming soon. And in terms of a price premium, and we also haven\u2019t given much insight into our price strategy. The one thing, I will highlight though, is we are entirely committed to a pay-as-you-go model in the United States with Omnipod 5. And so what that means is all of our existing DASH users will be able to transition to Omnipod 5 without having to worry about a lock-in period or having to pay some sort of upgrade fee. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that Omnipod 5 doesn\u2019t warrant a premium, because obviously, the performance in terms of hypoglycemia and other key performance indicators certainly deliver value to the market and so that\u2019s what\u2019s being evaluated. But we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And that\u2019s important for us because as we think about the pace of innovation increasing in the market, we want to be positioned to be able to deliver that innovation most quickly to our customers and not make them wait out these industry warranty periods, et cetera. So that we\u2019re committed to and we\u2019ll see on the price premium.\nWayde McMillan: Okay. And Larry on the margins for 2021, first of all, margins are an important part of the story for us. We have significant strategies running across the business to make sure that we have the strongest gross margins possible. And we see them as a big part of the differentiated story here for us. And when we look at the most recent quarter, what we\u2019ve called out in impact from COVID 180 basis points in foreign exchange. So if you take out those two, one items, the most recent quarter would be 65%. So COVID is having a pretty significant impact as well as FX on our gross margins. So that takes a bit of a step up away. And then when we look at how we progress in 2021, we have made a significant investment in our manufacturing operations, mainly here in the U.S. but also in our China facility. And we continue to make progress on our operations as well as our supply chain efficiencies. And so we have high confidence that we will get into the 67% to 70% range in 2021. And we still have high confidence that we can get to 70% over time. We\u2019re just a bit delayed here for a quarter or two, as our teams have shifted focus to deal with COVID and the safety and mitigation efforts related to that. But it has not diminished our game plan at all to push for 70% gross margins. And I know the team is doing a lot to keep that in focus while they deal with the current environment. And I know that we\u2019ll get back on track here in the next couple of quarters and be confident when we issue our guidance for 2021.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks. And there\u2019s a lot I can ask about in the quarter here. But Shacey, I actually want to focus on two longer term focus questions on points that you made. The first was that the number of pump users could double over the coming years. I\u2019m guessing coming means something like 5-ish. So if there is 400,000, 500,000 pump users in the U.S., I mean, that\u2019s a massive new patient opportunity over the next several years. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m thinking about the right way and how should we think about the number that Insulet can possibly grab during that time?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. You\u2019re seeing it the way we see it Robbie. We see this pretty significant technology inflection happening in Type 1 and actually beginning to happen in Type 2. So I think a lot of this is driven by adoption of CGM. And then, of course, we know that there\u2019s going to be great demand. It\u2019s one of the most anticipated developments in the pipeline with Omnipod 5. And so we do see that, we\u2019ve always said, we thought 50% was a pretty reasonable estimate for penetration into the pump market because you just needed to look at pediatrics. But we\u2019re seeing even pediatrics expand utilization of pumps in Type 1 pretty rapidly. And then I think this expansion of CGM has really driven more adoption too. So we do see that as a realistic TAM for us and an exciting one. And then we look at CGM, penetrating into Type 2s now, for us, that\u2019s just pipeline. We see a tremendous opportunity to bring Omnipod 5 to people living with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And I would say, we have the right to win in both of those markets. We have the specific obviously, really differentiated form factor advantages, and really excited about what integration with our sensor partners will bring to both of those populations.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks. And maybe if we think about, Shacey, the comments you made on the lower new patient adds in 2020, and that will impact the back part of this year and the first half of next year. I just want to make sure, do you see something with street numbers that worry you? We all know this is a recurring revenue business model and fewer new patients starts equal somewhat of a headwind next year. Does something worry you about where the Street is for next year? Because seeing what your competitor is doing with an integrated offering, Horizon 5, potentially, should be even better. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm around the launch next year. I just want to make sure that\u2019s more just the reality of the business model rather than trying to talk down expectations. Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: That\u2019s right, Robbie. We are not worried. I just always take the opportunity because we have such a different business model relative to obviously other insulin pump players out there. Just to educate on that. And Wayde, I don\u2019t know if you have any other color you want to add regarding the Street estimates.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. No, first of all, it\u2019s a really good question, because one of the reasons we elected to provide guidance last quarter was to give insight for people to understand our business model. And so the reason that Shacey is highlighting here, just to remind people that in the recurring business model that we\u2019ll be dealing with this headwind for the second two quarters of this year and into the first half of next year. But having said that, we have a lot of positive drivers in the business and when we \u2013 as specific with to your question on estimates that are out there, we have raised our guidance more than for the Q2 beat here. And so there should be some room in the second half, as you know, we\u2019ve also taken up the second half guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two number of questions for me, I\u2019ll start with Shacey. So Shacey, during this earning season, a lot of diabetes companies have talked about international sluggishness recovery related to the U.S. and just sort of, can you walk us through for your business and how this dynamics ex-U.S., or varying versus the U.S.? Is it a country specific, or do you think it\u2019s across multiple regions of your ex-U.S. business?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes, David and you\u2019ve hit on it. The recovery that we\u2019re seeing in Europe is definitely more modest than what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. today. And it is very much varied across the markets. Some are doing okay. And then others like France, which is obviously an important market for us is still very challenged. As hospitals don\u2019t open and many of those new patients would be served by the prestataire and they are occupied with other priorities. And so it\u2019s kind of a tale of multiple parts across Europe. And the other area that is more challenged is endo visits. And so there\u2019s been slower uptake of telehealth in Europe and many larger European markets see their Omnipod or new pump starts in hospital, the clinics rather than in private offices. And so obviously, hospitals are really challenged right now in many parts of the world. So I think, we\u2019re seeing encouraging things across all of our markets in terms of \u2013 endo visits starting to reopen in terms of our pipeline and new starts. But we\u2019re not back to normal still know that endo visits even in the United States are not back to where they were pre-COVID levels. So it\u2019s encouraging, but in the \u2013 in Europe, we are forecasting that it will be a much more moderate recovery from here through the rest of the year.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then kind of related question, just thinking about the broader new patient start impact. So, improving here in the third quarter guidance from prior, you\u2019re still saying 25% new patients start impact for the fourth quarter. So, the way to think about that is that simply a reflection of a conservatism or if I say you\u2019re ahead of pace here, you\u2019re sort of assuming, you\u2019re a little ahead of pace, but resurgence of flu season and what have you could impact that in the fourth quarter. And I guess, the question I would say is, I would sort of assume that the channel will be more able to handle a resurgence given telehealth patient conditioning, physician conditioning in the back half of the year. So, just help us understand that 25% maintenance relative to the improvement in the third quarter? Thanks so much.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. This is the most important metric for us. Our attrition and utilization metrics, although ticked up are very similar versus our historic levels. So, it really is all about new patients starts for us. And we\u2019ve estimated the U.S. around a third impacted here in Q3. And as Shacey said, given the dynamics internationally, we\u2019ve called it 50% internationally impact, it is \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a slower recovery there. And that is exactly it; we\u2019re just making sure that we keep some room for ourselves for resurgence here. And if we see headwinds in certain states within the U.S. or regions outside the U.S. start to be more impacted obviously, at the low end of the range of 50% impact overall for us, would mean Q3 would have to look like Q2, and we hope that we\u2019re not going back there. We \u2013 that\u2019s the low end. We hope that we can improve on that. Get closer to the 30% at the high end of the range and that\u2019s on a global basis. So that would mean that the regions combined would have to be 30% for us to be at the high end of the range. And so we see a lot of different scenarios playing out. Obviously, we don\u2019t know where the pandemic is heading? We\u2019re trying to do our best to give ourselves a good estimate here. If we think about why we set guidance originally, it was to put these stakes in the ground, so that we can then help everybody understand how we\u2019re performing against them. And in Q2, we did very well, came in at the bottom end of the range and beat expectations in both regions. So, we\u2019ve moved the steak a little bit more favorable here in Q3. We\u2019ll see how the pandemic progresses. And then the last part of the question, David, around telehealth for the endos and for us virtual training, it has changed the game. I think the benefit of virtual training and the ability for patients to still get the therapy they need, even in a COVID-related world. We have the capability to do that, as Shacey said; most of our trainings in Q2 were virtual. And so we have that capability built now, and that should help us offset, what could have been a worse impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Shacey, I wanted to go back to some of the comments you made on Omnipod 5 in some of the potential competitive advantages, you\u2019ve listed through form factor and customization, and what have you? I thought the adaptability point you made was interesting, and we\u2019d love to hear you maybe flesh that out a little bit. I\u2019m not sure off the top of my head; I know, exactly what you were referring to there? Thanks. And then I do have a follow-up. Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Jeff. Yes. So, when I talk about adaptability, I\u2019m really referring to other systems that are in the market, where the \u2013 there are still many dobbs \u2013 knobs and dials to adjust on these systems in terms of various inputs regarding, for example your basal rate or your total daily dose, or your insulin to carb ratio, such that, if the algorithm and the system is not working aggressively enough or in a satisfactory way for the patient that they have to go back into the physician and have adjustment made in order for the system to work more effectively for them. Our system and the algorithm has really been designed to grow and learn with the patient and consciously, we\u2019ve taken a lot of those knobs and dials away, so that the system can actually do its job and simply adapt and perform better for the patient. And so that really, the goal there is to make it much easier, both for the clinician and for the patient, and to rely on the algorithm, to grow with the user. So, there are examples of, if the user adopts a new exercise routine, that means that their insulins, they require potentially less insulin. The system is designed to notice that and to learn and adjust; same thing with children as they get older, they may require more insulin. The system is designed to see that and adjust to that. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about what adaptability will bring. We\u2019re also really excited just about the flexibility of the system. We\u2019ve talked about customizable set points and other things with the system that should make it just incredibly user-friendly. And I think that was demonstrated at ADA when the moderator compared our usability scores to iPhones. I mean, that\u2019s really how simple the system is designed to be.\nJeff Johnson: Yes. Understood. Very helpful. And then Wayde maybe just \u2013 I think you mentioned here just in passing to David\u2019s question that ask was maybe down closer to that 33% or a third below your expectations at the start of the year and I know that\u2019s relative to expectations. I think if I look at your \u2013 one of your competitors, who gives pretty clear numbers and you can back into numbers, their new patients starts in 2Q seemed like they might have been flat even up 10% or 15% year-over-year from MDI population perspective. So, if your new patient starts in to 2Q again, relative to expectations, but if I adjusted that maybe, down 10% or 15% or something, help me bridge that gap, maybe between a competitor be in flat to up and you guys may be in down year-over-year on new patient starts from the MDI channel. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. Well, just to start with, we still get most of our new patients from the MDI channel. So, it\u2019s about 80% and I can\u2019t really speak to the math for the competitors, but certainly, can give you more insight to our pipeline. We had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter coming into 2020, and we set our guidance appropriately, and we\u2019re not expecting continued record new patients start quarters every year, but we still had a pretty significant number of new patients starts in there. And so still coming in at 50% of our expectations globally is strong. And the U.S. was better than the 50% and had a pretty good quarter there as well as evidenced by the 31% growth rate in the quarter. We certainly got the benefit of inventory there. But we\u2019re still mid-20s growth rates for the U.S. And so although we were exceeding that in the last few quarters of 2019, I think at 26%, 27% growth rate ex-inventory build is still a really healthy quarter. So, it gives you a sense of yes, we\u2019re off our expectations for the year, but still very strong new patient start growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is now open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening, everybody. And thank you for taking the questions. I have two quick ones. I think. you mentioned the moderator at ADA and the commentary there, we really haven\u2019t had the chance to sort of group catch up with you post-ADA. And I was curious if there\u2019s anything else you want to highlight that really caught your eye?\nShacey Petrovic: Coming out of ADA, I think, what would be noticeable is just that we\u2019re in this sort of technology adoption and pace of technology increasing in the market for people living with diabetes. It\u2019s just a really exciting time. I mean, there were multiple AID systems, multiple next generation sensors presented. And so when we think about, what that could bring to people living with the disease, it\u2019s very exciting. To me, it\u2019s part of why we remain so bullish on adoption of technology among people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And obviously, we\u2019re really excited about the role that we\u2019ll play in that. I think this year\u2019s ADA, if you just looked at the enthusiasm, I think there were thousands and thousands of physicians, who had dialed into to listen to our presentations. There\u2019s just tremendous enthusiasm for automated insulin delivery and what it will bring to the community.\nJoanne Wuensch: And my second question is, as you prepare for Omnipod 5 launch, can you walk us through sort of the steps that you think about, so that you\u2019re not in back order supply right out of the gate once it\u2019s out the door?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, sure. I think that\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re thinking a lot about that right now. We\u2019ve been \u2013 obviously; I highlighted it in my remarks. We\u2019ve been already thinking about, how do we build capacity and be in a position to be a very strong from an inventory position. The next steps for us outside of getting through our clinical work and securing clearance are to really think about market access. As I mentioned with Larry at the first question, we are committed to this pay as you go model. And so what that means is that everybody will be able to transition to Omnipod 5, as soon as they have access. We\u2019re not going to regulating this with a four-year warranty period or upgrade fees or anything like that, which means there\u2019s going to be tremendous demand both among our existing users and what we anticipate to be tremendous demand among new users. And a lot of that will be regulated by access. And so our teams are already now thinking about how do they rapidly expand access, particularly in our pharmacy channel. I think we\u2019re very fortunate, because we did all of the work to really establish our \u2013 both the new business model, the new wholesaler distribution and the pharmacy access. And so this should go much more smoothly and much more rapidly than it did with DASH. And actually, it went very well with DASH. But that work is already underway as well. And then we\u2019ve had a lot of work going on around onboarding and training of patients, which is why we were ahead of the game in terms of being able to launch all of our virtual tools with Omnipod during the pandemic. But what\u2019s great about the experience that we\u2019ve had is that we know that patients of all sorts of demographics can be very happily and successfully trained at home. And we had less of an experience before the pandemic. Now, we know it for certain across all patient demographics. And so that sets us up, I think, for a lot of success rapidly and cost-effectively being able to bring patients onto Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. your line is now open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on, on a really strong quarter, given \u2013 given all that everyone\u2019s going through right now. Wayde, if I could, just one question on the guidance, sorry to harp on this, but I guess as I look through the back half of the year implied guidance for Q4 plus what you gave for Q3. it does look like on a comp adjusted basis, growth is decelerating. And I\u2019m just curious to pick your brain a little bit more about that. Just given the fact that it feels like we\u2019re past peak unemployment, right. So, it feels like attrition should actually stabilize at this point to move lower. Am I thinking about that wrong? And it feels like new patient ads should start to accelerate maybe, just a little bit of color there would be great.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. And I hope you\u2019re right. on unemployment, I think we\u2019ve got long ways to go to understand, where we\u2019re at in this pandemic. But it really speaks to the point that Shacey highlighted in her opening remarks and that I provided some more detail in my remarks as well, is the way that our business model works. And when we take half, the new patients starts that we\u2019re planning out of Q2 and even though we have an improving Q3 and improving Q4 through the end of the year, when you take new patient starts out, it creates a headwind to the growth rate compared to last year. So, it really highlights the very tough comp that we created for ourselves in 2019. If you think about, where we were in the second half of 2019, we launched DASH. we entered the pharmacy channel and we launched our pay-as-you-go model. So, we had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter through the end of 2019. So, we set up some very tough comps and you can look at the comps individually by metric; sales, price, utilization, attrition. And if all of those are fairly consistent, it\u2019s all about new patient starts. And so with the COVID headwinds here, although we have improving new patient starts through the end of the year. by no means, are we stacking up new patients starts on a record-breaking nature like we did last year. So that\u2019s going to impact our growth rates with those tough comps. We\u2019ll see how we go, pandemic is making forecasting more challenging than ever. I like that we put these stakes in the ground last quarter. We\u2019re going to continue to measure ourselves against them, see how we do here again in Q3.\nDanielle Antalffy: Yes. thanks for that. And yes, I was going to say, Wayde, that really \u2013 this pandemic is really making you work hard for your money there. The follow-up question I had was on a potential bolus of new patients, and I\u2019m not sure how you guys are thinking about this. but I guess, as patients start to sort of go back to their endo, do you expect to see a bolus of new patients at some point; anecdotally, I have a friend who just recently got diagnosed. He wants to go on the Omnipod. He\u2019s waiting though. And so just curious to see how you guys are thinking about a potential bolus at some point.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. It is something we\u2019re thinking about. it\u2019s difficult to predict obviously. But we do know that endo; in the U.S., where we have the most visibility. We do know that endo visits are down still significantly. And so \u2013 and then there\u2019s a portion that\u2019s just happening by a telehealth, people are less likely, and physicians are less likely to transition to new technologies via telehealth than they are in in-person visits. So, I do think that there is this dynamic, where people who probably need better technology and better care are not getting it today. And that\u2019s really concerning, frankly, because it\u2019s a vulnerable population as it relates to COVID. And so I will do everything that we can to educate the community, educate clinicians about this and that there\u2019s, it\u2019s very easy to transition to get a prescription to be able to trial the device and be able to get started at home. And there may very well be a bolus of people. we are not counting on it. But certainly, I hope that everybody who needs care is getting it, or we\u2019ll get it soon as the economy start to continue to reopen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, everyone. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up first on virtual training. There\u2019s a lot of benefits now. you\u2019ve kind of alluded to the future benefits and can you outline for us maybe, the speed of patients coming on. how that differs versus in-person as well as the cost? And I guess in a nutshell, is this hundreds of basis points of margin, for example, in the time or can you cut down the time by a third?\nShacey Petrovic: So, I\u2019ll start with the first part and then maybe Wayde can comment although I don\u2019t know how much insight we have yet into sort of the cost differential or the impact on margin. I will say that just feedback from both clinicians, who have attended trainings in some cases with their patients that we\u2019re hosting virtually as well as directly from new customers has been absolutely fantastic regarding virtual training. And one of the pieces of the feedback is that it\u2019s just much easier to schedule in everybody\u2019s life. And so certainly, we see an easier time getting scheduled and we can also leverage our field team better in terms of being able to automatically schedule them and have people support multiple areas or multiple territories. And so I think all of those things bode well and we view this, as I said very much as not just a temporary thing that we\u2019re doing to support patients and clinicians during COVID. but as a viable, very exciting way that we can scale our Omnipod 5 training and delight customers, because it\u2019s clear that people love being trained in the comfort of their own homes.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. I think the only thing I could add there really is, just keep in mind what Shacey said it\u2019s early days. I think there\u2019s some silver linings with the COVID pandemic here. and maybe, one of them is a situation, where we\u2019re forced into more virtual trainings, both us to support it as well as patients and physicians. And I think we\u2019re all learning that there are some benefits. patients enjoy getting trained at home in the comfort of their own homes and we\u2019re finding out that it could be more efficient as Shacey said. We don\u2019t have to have our clinical reps in \u2013 within driving distance of all the customers that we want to bring on in person. So, there are certainly efficiencies to be gained. The real question is how large of a percentage does virtual training become over time. There are benefits to being in person. We know that clinicians see a lot of those benefits to seeing their patients in person. So, I think it\u2019s going to be a mixed bag over time. Margaret, I think just we\u2019ll keep in mind that it\u2019s early days, we\u2019re learning a lot. We certainly know a lot more now than we did at the start of Q2.\nMargaret Kaczor: Okay, great. Helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up in terms of some of the commentary on next generation products. You guys, obviously, you find the treasure around the corner, and you\u2019re already starting to talk about G6, maybe some other software, digital health advancements. but as you guys look at that next generation product, you referenced type two. So, I assume you\u2019ve kind of done a little bit of work of what are the primary gatekeepers showed adoption, why haven\u2019t pumps succeeded and access is one, but how do you address some of the other issues on the engineering side, limiting patient touch and seamlessness and the payers.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Margaret, I think it\u2019s a good question. I actually think we\u2019ve learned a lot, because of DASH. I mean, we\u2019ve seen a great uptake in this patient population as a result of the simplicity of the platform and just how powerful pharmacy access is. In that experience and understanding how that user segment is using DASH has given us insight into how Omnipod 5 five and future generations of omnipod 5 could be impactful in that population. So, I don\u2019t want to reveal too much there from a competitive standpoint, but I will say that you\u2019ll see us start the clinical work just to evaluate our technology in that population. And I think we\u2019ll learn even more then, and we\u2019re confident based on our experience with DASH and based on the fact that more and more people living with insulin dependent type 2 are adopting CGM, that we have a great technology to bring to that market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Just a few quick clarification questions. On the 2Q new patient ads, you did 50% of your original goal. Did you quantify the level between U.S. and international?\nWayde McMillan: Hi, Jayson, we have not, but we can provide a little more color. The U.S. was better than the 50% and outside the U.S. was higher than the 50%. The combination of the two got us to the 50% for the quarter.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. What was the estimated impact of stocking in 2Q? I think, I thought it was $6 million to $7 million, but I just want to be strong there?\nWayde McMillan: Sure. It was actually very similar to Q1. So in the U.S., we had an impact of $4 million to $5 million and for outside the U.S., it was $2 million, so a global $6 million to $7 million impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTravis Steed: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll ask both of mine upfront in interest of time. Wayde, the 30% to 50% that you\u2019re guarding to below expectations for Q3, just curious how that compares to what you\u2019re seeing in June and July, if you\u2019re assuming get worsen here, or assuming that were stable? And then Shacey on horizon, just kind of walked through some of the roadmap here between finishing up the trial, submitting the data. When we\u2019re going to see the data and some of the gating factors to launch that earlier in the first half versus later in the second half? Thanks for taking the questions.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure.\nWayde McMillan: Hey, Travis, I can start. Yes. So in regards to the Q3, 30% to 50% new patients start reduction from expectations, that is better than we saw in Q2, it was 50% in Q2. So by definition, everything below 50% will be better just to clarify that. And that is as a result of seeing gradual improvement coming out of Q2 into July. So it is different by region, as I mentioned upfront, every state, we see our reps in some cases getting back and meeting with customers and physicians and then in some cases that stops. Clinic-by-clinic, they\u2019re turning on, turning off. There is a lot of variability, as Shacey said, just across the U.S. And outside the U.S., it\u2019s a tough call because some countries are opening up and doing better. And as Shacey referenced, some countries are almost nil and still locked down and really not bringing on new patients. So very much a mixed bag out there, but just generally, we are starting to see improvements coming out of Q2, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re guiding to more of a 30% to 50% or a third to a half versus a half that we saw on Q2.\nShacey Petrovic: That\u2019s great. Thanks. And then your question regarding Omnipod 5 five. So as I mentioned in my remarks, all of our patients will be completed or all participants will be completed with the Omnipod 5 study at the \u2013 by Q4. And then we don\u2019t \u2013 just as general practice, we don\u2019t give estimates on submission, but that timing of completion of participants in the trial gives us great confidence in our limited market release in the first half of 2020. And then in terms of data, we\u2019ve been invited to share our data at ATTD. So we will definitely expect to do that, as that takes place in February, and is likely to be a virtual conference.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nJason Bednar: Hi, good afternoon. This is Jason on for Matt, and thanks for taking the questions and squeezing us in here. Really just focused on one point here, Shacey, just wondering if there\u2019s any newer adjusted contracting we should consider with payers heading into the launch of Omnipod 5? I mean, do you plan to have all that in place heading into 2021? Is that a dynamic you\u2019d expect to work through once you get this system approved? Really I just wonder how that paradynamic plays into some of the access points talk to on a couple of questions so far.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. So I think we\u2019re in a good spot because what this is, is an amendment to existing contracts, as opposed to what we had to accomplish with DASH, where we had to go build the relationships and then go establish contracts and pricing in terms with all of our payers. So we are way ahead of the game on that front. But we do plan to use the data to be able to establish a reimbursement with our payers. And so that data will hopefully be available shortly after, our patients or our participants complete the trial in Q4. And I would imagine that the end of 2020, beginning of 2021, our teams are working very hard on establishing access for Omnipod 5.\nJason Bednar: Okay. And then just actually within that just one quick follow-up then. I mean, if it is as simple as an amendment, is that \u2013 would that amendment be the same or would it be a simple amendment, if you\u2019re seeking a price premium? Or is that an amendment just to provide access?\nShacey Petrovic: No, Jayson, you\u2019re hitting on a really important point and this is the debate that\u2019s going on internally currently. We know that the performance of Omnipod 5 demands a premium. It\u2019s a product that delivers pretty remarkable outcomes for users. What we\u2019re going to be weighing that against and where there\u2019s a lot of analysis going on right now is, the trade off there is just how quickly we can establish access. And so that\u2019s the work that\u2019s underway with the teams right now, and we have not yet shared. And I\u2019m not even sure we\u2019ve landed completely, but shared where we plan to be with a premium. But the access will happen very quickly or much more quickly, if we don\u2019t have a premium or we have a minimal premium, and it will take a much slower ramp if we decide to attach a premium to it. So that\u2019s the rub.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one last question. This question comes from Matt Taylor of UBS. Your line is now open.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks for taking the question. Since nobody focused on it, I wanted to ask about drug delivery, since it was a lot higher and you had forecast, and I mean, I think it makes sense during COVID that you want to have more at-home delivery of these drugs. Can you comment on whether you think that\u2019s going to be a lasting trend? I know you don\u2019t have the full forecast past few quarters. But do you think that this could change the trajectory of that business or you\u2019re focused on it?\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Matt for the question, I really \u2013 I think it\u2019s durable to the extent that the pandemic is durable. So I don\u2019t know that it changes the trajectory significantly, it\u2019s really great to see the power of the pod in drug delivery. But it\u2019s probably not an area that we see changing dramatically. And I maintain that, right now it\u2019s very difficult to see any opportunities that are more attractive than the massive growing market that is before us in diabetes. We see just the CGM and technology adoption is at this inflection point and we\u2019re on the cusp of launching Omnipod 5, and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\nMatt Taylor: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic.\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Thank you. Despite the continuing effects of the pandemic Insulet delivered strong operational and financial performance, and our team continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt quickly to challenges and execute on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. So to all of our employees, I want to thank you for your relentless hard work and dedication. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how we\u2019ve rallied together to support one another and to ensure we continue to advance our mission. Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thank you. I want to echo Shacey's gratitude to our Insulet team members who have adapted to these extraordinary times. Thanks to their hard work, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We continue to make excellent progress on our strategic imperatives as we invest for growth, enhance our global competitive differentiation and serve our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes. In the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 29%, which was $10 million above our guidance range. This strong performance continues to be fueled by our total Omnipod growth of 27% and was $6 million above our guidance range. Regarding new Omnipod starts, we communicated that our guidance for Q2 included an estimate that the pandemic would lower our expectations from the beginning of the year by 50% to 75% with the U.S. closer to 50% and international closer to 75%. Actual Q2 results were favorable in both regions, as the combined impact was approximately 50%. Attrition and utilization came in near expected levels with slightly higher attrition and slightly lower utilization. Breaking down our revenue results by product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 31% exceeding our guidance range of 21% to 25%. Approximately $4 million to $5 million of the increase resulted from the net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels. In Q2, we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total volume. Pharmacy channel growth contributed to the increased inventory levels. Stocking for the pandemic also drove channel inventory increases across all three channels, including our DME and Direct. New Omnipod starts were also favorable versus our expectations. Our growing customer base and Omnipod DASH adoption primarily through the pharmacy channel, as well as the mixed benefit from the premium on DASH, continued to be the primary drivers of our growth. In the second quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH continued to drive over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts. International Omnipod revenue grew 20% compared to our range of 15% to 19%, including a benefit of approximately $2 million of channel inventory build due to COVID and to a lesser extent, better than expected new Omnipod starts. Drug delivery revenue increased 49% to $24 million, which was $4 million above our guidance range. While we expected greater than normal revenue growth in Q2 resulting from the shift in timing of production from Q1, the overachievement was due to our partners increased forecast related to the current environment. Overall, we achieved robust revenue growth in the second quarter building off of our strong momentum from 2019 and Q1 of 2020. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 63%, down 270 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations. The year-over-year change, included headwinds primarily due to the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing lines, as well as an approximate 180 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-related costs and 40 basis points from foreign exchange. These headwinds were partially offset by the favorable revenue mix benefit from Omnipod DASH growth through the pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model with no upfront charge for the PDM, as well as continued improvements throughout our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. Operating expenses in the second quarter were in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 20%. Our strong adjusted EBITDA was due to the favorable revenue performance, lower travel and meeting expenses and timing of certain expenses, including Omnipod 5 clinical trial expenses, much of which moved from the second quarter into the third quarter. Regarding cash and liquidity, we are in a strong cash position with the earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the second quarter with $868 million in cash and investments, including the additional cash raise of $477 million from the equity offering in May. The cash raise strengthen our balance sheet and ensures we can continue to invest for growth, including R&D, commercial and capital expenditures in order to execute our strategic imperatives and provide additional liquidity during the pandemic, should we need it. We have a differentiated position in a large and under-penetrated market, and we want to come out of this pandemic stronger by continuing to grow in our global markets. Turning to guidance. Although COVID impacts are not predictable, last quarter we continue to provide guidance in order to help investors forecast our business, understand our growth drivers and highlight the areas of the business that will be most impacted. Given the information we had and an estimate of the impact of the macro indicators, along with the durability of our recurring revenue model, we maintained our full year 2020 revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range. As a result of second quarter revenue that exceeded expectations and a stronger second half outlook, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance growth rate to a range of 17% to 19% up from our previous expectation of 15%. This includes raising total Omnipod to a range of 18% to 20%. By product line for U.S. Omnipod, we're raising our expected revenue growth to 19% to 21%. And for international Omnipod, we're raising our expectations to 17% to 19%. The key drivers of our increased full year guidance for total Omnipod are the compounding benefit of second quarter hire new Omnipod starts, which add incremental revenue in the second half of the year and our expectations of improved new Omnipod starts in the third quarter. In terms of expected new Omnipod starts, our guidance now assumes an improvement in the third quarter, global new starts compared to our guide last quarter. We now estimate that new starts will be approximately 30% to 50% lower than our beginning of year estimate with the U.S. again at the low end and international near the high end. This compares to the 50% we guided to on our Q1 call. We anticipate fourth quarter global new starts will still be approximately 25% lower, consistent with last quarter's guide. This results in the achievement of approximately 60% to 75% of our original pre-COVID assumptions at the start of the year. Our revised guidance of new Omnipod starts factors in a gradual improvement from Q2 to year end. We continue to assume downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for potential pandemic related headwinds. While current trends are beginning to show signs of improving conditions, COVID continues to create uncertainties and it is difficult to accurately predict the progression Of the pandemic. Our global diabetes business remains well positioned to manage through multiple scenarios and continue strong growth this year, as well as in 2021 and over the long-term. Lastly, for drug delivery, we now anticipate growth of 3% to 6% resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. On a full year basis, we are reaffirming gross margin of approximately 63%, which includes an estimated $7 million to $10 million of one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $5 million to $10 million. Also factored in is the slower ramp in our U.S. manufacturing lines due to the pandemic. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with last year, as we plan to invest for growth in our innovation pipeline, global commercial initiatives and with our manufacturing and supply chain operations. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, we are reaffirming our expectation as a percentage of revenue at the low end of the 13% to 17% range. For the third quarter of 2020, we are guiding to total company revenue growth of 13% to 15%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 12% to 14%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod growth of 14% to 16%, international Omnipod of 9% to 11% and drug delivery of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, the pandemics impact on our global new starts in the second quarter has a compounding effect on revenue, which mostly impacts the second half of the year. Nevertheless, the durability of our differentiated recurring revenue model insulates us to a large degree, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base. As a result, we still plan to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter of 2020 and the full year, despite the impact of COVID. For our 2021 outlook, assuming market conditions stabilized in 2021, we remain on track to deliver our long range plan target of $1 billion in revenue. As communicated on our Q1 earnings call, we expect gross margin of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid teens, closer to the low end of the range. In conclusion, we had significant momentum to start the year and our first half 2020 results benefited from that momentum. Our differentiated business model and product platform, operational excellence and strong financial profile enable us to continue to invest for growth, while mitigating the impacts of COVID and related headwinds. As a result, we expect to deliver 18% to 20% revenue growth this year. We have a very healthy and robust business and are well positioned for continued growth over the long-term. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Okay. And Larry on the margins for 2021, first of all, margins are an important part of the story for us. We have significant strategies running across the business to make sure that we have the strongest gross margins possible. And we see them as a big part of the differentiated story here for us. And when we look at the most recent quarter, what we've called out in impact from COVID 180 basis points in foreign exchange. So if you take out those two, one items, the most recent quarter would be 65%. So COVID is having a pretty significant impact as well as FX on our gross margins. So that takes a bit of a step up away. And then when we look at how we progress in 2021, we have made a significant investment in our manufacturing operations, mainly here in the U.S. but also in our China facility. And we continue to make progress on our operations as well as our supply chain efficiencies. And so we have high confidence that we will get into the 67% to 70% range in 2021. And we still have high confidence that we can get to 70% over time. We're just a bit delayed here for a quarter or two, as our teams have shifted focus to deal with COVID and the safety and mitigation efforts related to that. But it has not diminished our game plan at all to push for 70% gross margins. And I know the team is doing a lot to keep that in focus while they deal with the current environment. And I know that we'll get back on track here in the next couple of quarters and be confident when we issue our guidance for 2021. Yes. No, first of all, it's a really good question, because one of the reasons we elected to provide guidance last quarter was to give insight for people to understand our business model. And so the reason that Shacey is highlighting here, just to remind people that in the recurring business model that we'll be dealing with this headwind for the second two quarters of this year and into the first half of next year. But having said that, we have a lot of positive drivers in the business and when we \u2013 as specific with to your question on estimates that are out there, we have raised our guidance more than for the Q2 beat here. And so there should be some room in the second half, as you know, we've also taken up the second half guidance. Yes. This is the most important metric for us. Our attrition and utilization metrics, although ticked up are very similar versus our historic levels. So, it really is all about new patients starts for us. And we've estimated the U.S. around a third impacted here in Q3. And as Shacey said, given the dynamics internationally, we've called it 50% internationally impact, it is \u2013 we're seeing a slower recovery there. And that is exactly it; we're just making sure that we keep some room for ourselves for resurgence here. And if we see headwinds in certain states within the U.S. or regions outside the U.S. start to be more impacted obviously, at the low end of the range of 50% impact overall for us, would mean Q3 would have to look like Q2, and we hope that we're not going back there. We \u2013 that's the low end. We hope that we can improve on that. Get closer to the 30% at the high end of the range and that's on a global basis. So that would mean that the regions combined would have to be 30% for us to be at the high end of the range. And so we see a lot of different scenarios playing out. Obviously, we don't know where the pandemic is heading? We're trying to do our best to give ourselves a good estimate here. If we think about why we set guidance originally, it was to put these stakes in the ground, so that we can then help everybody understand how we're performing against them. And in Q2, we did very well, came in at the bottom end of the range and beat expectations in both regions. So, we've moved the steak a little bit more favorable here in Q3. We'll see how the pandemic progresses. And then the last part of the question, David, around telehealth for the endos and for us virtual training, it has changed the game. I think the benefit of virtual training and the ability for patients to still get the therapy they need, even in a COVID-related world. We have the capability to do that, as Shacey said; most of our trainings in Q2 were virtual. And so we have that capability built now, and that should help us offset, what could have been a worse impact. Sure. Well, just to start with, we still get most of our new patients from the MDI channel. So, it's about 80% and I can't really speak to the math for the competitors, but certainly, can give you more insight to our pipeline. We had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter coming into 2020, and we set our guidance appropriately, and we're not expecting continued record new patients start quarters every year, but we still had a pretty significant number of new patients starts in there. And so still coming in at 50% of our expectations globally is strong. And the U.S. was better than the 50% and had a pretty good quarter there as well as evidenced by the 31% growth rate in the quarter. We certainly got the benefit of inventory there. But we're still mid-20s growth rates for the U.S. And so although we were exceeding that in the last few quarters of 2019, I think at 26%, 27% growth rate ex-inventory build is still a really healthy quarter. So, it gives you a sense of yes, we're off our expectations for the year, but still very strong new patient start growth. Sure. And I hope you're right. on unemployment, I think we've got long ways to go to understand, where we're at in this pandemic. But it really speaks to the point that Shacey highlighted in her opening remarks and that I provided some more detail in my remarks as well, is the way that our business model works. And when we take half, the new patients starts that we're planning out of Q2 and even though we have an improving Q3 and improving Q4 through the end of the year, when you take new patient starts out, it creates a headwind to the growth rate compared to last year. So, it really highlights the very tough comp that we created for ourselves in 2019. If you think about, where we were in the second half of 2019, we launched DASH. we entered the pharmacy channel and we launched our pay-as-you-go model. So, we had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter through the end of 2019. So, we set up some very tough comps and you can look at the comps individually by metric; sales, price, utilization, attrition. And if all of those are fairly consistent, it's all about new patient starts. And so with the COVID headwinds here, although we have improving new patient starts through the end of the year. by no means, are we stacking up new patients starts on a record-breaking nature like we did last year. So that's going to impact our growth rates with those tough comps. We'll see how we go, pandemic is making forecasting more challenging than ever. I like that we put these stakes in the ground last quarter. We're going to continue to measure ourselves against them, see how we do here again in Q3. Yes. I think the only thing I could add there really is, just keep in mind what Shacey said it's early days. I think there's some silver linings with the COVID pandemic here. and maybe, one of them is a situation, where we're forced into more virtual trainings, both us to support it as well as patients and physicians. And I think we're all learning that there are some benefits. patients enjoy getting trained at home in the comfort of their own homes and we're finding out that it could be more efficient as Shacey said. We don't have to have our clinical reps in \u2013 within driving distance of all the customers that we want to bring on in person. So, there are certainly efficiencies to be gained. The real question is how large of a percentage does virtual training become over time. There are benefits to being in person. We know that clinicians see a lot of those benefits to seeing their patients in person. So, I think it's going to be a mixed bag over time. Margaret, I think just we'll keep in mind that it's early days, we're learning a lot. We certainly know a lot more now than we did at the start of Q2. Hi, Jayson, we have not, but we can provide a little more color. The U.S. was better than the 50% and outside the U.S. was higher than the 50%. The combination of the two got us to the 50% for the quarter. Sure. It was actually very similar to Q1. So in the U.S., we had an impact of $4 million to $5 million and for outside the U.S., it was $2 million, so a global $6 million to $7 million impact. Hey, Travis, I can start. Yes. So in regards to the Q3, 30% to 50% new patients start reduction from expectations, that is better than we saw in Q2, it was 50% in Q2. So by definition, everything below 50% will be better just to clarify that. And that is as a result of seeing gradual improvement coming out of Q2 into July. So it is different by region, as I mentioned upfront, every state, we see our reps in some cases getting back and meeting with customers and physicians and then in some cases that stops. Clinic-by-clinic, they're turning on, turning off. There is a lot of variability, as Shacey said, just across the U.S. And outside the U.S., it's a tough call because some countries are opening up and doing better. And as Shacey referenced, some countries are almost nil and still locked down and really not bringing on new patients. So very much a mixed bag out there, but just generally, we are starting to see improvements coming out of Q2, and that's where we're guiding to more of a 30% to 50% or a third to a half versus a half that we saw on Q2."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While COVID-19 continues to challenge Insulet, our customers and our communities around the world. The dedication of our employees, partners and the healthcare providers, serving people with diabetes, helped us to deliver an extraordinary quarter on nearly every dimension. We achieved second quarter revenue of over $226 million, exceeding our expectations. This growth represented a 29% increase driven by 27% revenue growth in our total Omnipod product line. And it was a record revenue quarter across every single product line. Delivering these results in such uncertain times is a testament to the tremendous execution of our team. We are very fortunate to have strong fundamentals in place. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation. Our performance in the first half of this year is reflective of our great momentum in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. While we are seeing an impact of COVID, it's a two-part story for Insulet. There are many aspects of our performance that we celebrate. We are creating new ways to serve our customers that are more scalable and more engaging. We're making our supply chain and manufacturing operations more resilient and adding significant capacity in preparation for the Omnipod 5 launch next year. And even in the face of this pandemic, we are making exciting progress on our innovation programs. In the near-term, due to COVID impact on new starts, we have the reality of the compounding impact on our revenue growth rates in the second half of this year and the first half of next. But ultimately, we expect to grow total Omnipod revenue 18% to 20% in 2020, despite this impact. And we are building capabilities across the company to maximize our position in the market and serve our mission for many years to come. Insulet will emerge stronger and better from this challenge, thanks to our talented and committed team. On today's call, I'm going to speak about how we are continuing to manage through the COVID environment, our achievements toward our strategic imperatives and our longer term expectations. Wayde will dive into the details of our financial results and guidance, and we will then take questions. We continue to grow our global customer base during the second quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had anticipated 50% to 75% fewer new Omnipod customers as compared to our original expectations at the start of the year. We landed closer to 50% exceeding our expectations. Our performance was driven by our commercial teams who throughout the quarter expanded utilization of our virtual onboarding tools, piloted novel programs to increase awareness and adoption of Omnipod and continue to expand affordable access to Omnipod across the globe. And it was supported by our innovation and operations teams who helped us to grow our manufacturing capacity and resilience and deliver an exciting new release of Omnipod DASH, while also advancing Omnipod 5 towards commercial launch. This quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. One, to deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization. Starting with consumer-focused innovation. The Omnipod form factor has been our key advantage since our founding. We hear from Podders around the world who come to us from MDI and other pumps that the ease of use and the freedom associated with the pod is life-changing. Over the last several years, we've benefited from the differentiated form factor and increasing market access to grow our Omnipod customer base. Last year, we fully launched Omnipod DASH and our growth accelerated, even as other CGM integrated automated insulin delivery systems came to market. This is a testament to the value of our consumer-focused innovation, including relentless focus on ease of use, companion apps and cloud connectivity. And it is a testament to the compelling form factor of Omnipod. In a few quarters, users will no longer have to choose between the Omnipod form factor and CGM integrated automated insulin delivery. Omnipod 5 offers both. Adoption of Omnipod DASH continues to grow, driven by both the ease of use of the platform and our pay-as-you-go business model, primarily through the pharmacy channel in the United States. This is a uniquely differentiated offering that eliminates restrictions and makes treatment accessible to a broader range of customers. We continue to see strong adoption among MDI users in both the type 1 and type 2 segments. In the second quarter, approximately 30% of our U.S. new Omnipod customers were typed 2 consistent with last quarter. We continue to make great strides within the type 2 diabetes population. A market we are uniquely positioned to serve, given our differentiated product and our access through the pharmacy with no restrictions and no upfront costs. Coverage for Omnipod DASH continues to expand with approximately 65% of lives now covered, primarily through the pharmacy channel. In June, we also launched a major Omnipod DASH release, including several features that further improve simplicity and ease of use. These include automatic data uploads so that users and their clinicians have instant real-time cloud access to data without the need to connect and download from a computer. We have been working on that vision for years to streamline clinic workflow. And we have already heard from users how valuable this is to enable telehealth visits in our current environment. We can also now push future software updates wirelessly to our customers. And we are delighted to now offer Spanish language as an option for Omnipod DASH users in the United States. In the second quarter, we saw expanding use of our virtual patient onboarding tools, which have been well received by consumers and healthcare providers. The vast majority of our new customers were onboarded virtually. Omnipod simplicity and ease of use are clearly differentiated in this environment and both type 1 and type 2 MDI users can easily get started on Omnipod from the comfort of their homes. Our virtual training capabilities have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID on growth of new Omnipod customers. And they also lay a foundation for consumer-friendly, cost-effective and scalable onboarding of new users to Omnipod 5 when it launches. In addition to the success we're having with Omnipod DASH, we made great progress on Omnipod 5 and remain on track to launch in the first half of next year. We resumed our pivotal study in June and presented our first data from the Omnipod 5 pre-pivotal study at the American Diabetes Association Virtual Conference. The results demonstrated best-in-class usability and time and closed loop, excellent time and range and statistically significant improvements in hypoglycemia compared to prior therapy. More than half of the participants have completed the Omnipod 5 pivotal study, and all participants should finish by Q4 putting us in a solid position to launch Omnipod 5 in the first half of 2021. Virtually all cryo participants have enthusiastically requested to continue using Omnipod 5. So we are supporting an extension phase to enable them to remain on product. This allows us to collect additional longer term data, which will be helpful insights for clinicians, payers and for our Omnipod 5 innovation pipeline. Participant feedback has been terrific. Just last week, we were touched to hear from a parent who said \u201cwith Omnipod 5, I now have my child back, and my family has their mom back\u201d. We know that we're third to market, and as such, we didn't design Omnipod 5 just to be an incremental improvement automated insulin delivery. We designed our system to revolutionize insulin delivery for people living with Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, and to bring AID to millions of people still relying on multiple daily injections. Omnipod 5 brings together the pods compelling form factor, excellent time and range, low hypoglycemia, customizable set points, and adaptively that is designed to limit the extent to which HCPs need to tweak the system to help users get great outcomes. Our platform will also offer unique benefits, including complete personal smartphone control, which eliminates the need for a separate PDM. Thanks to our effort to put the algorithm on the pod, we expect users to be able to download the Omnipod 5 app, pair with their pod and enjoy the benefits of Omnipod; no infusion sets, no separate controller and nothing else to think about. We also know that smartphone control isn't for everyone, but we wanted to ensure that our users could enjoy the benefits of real-time data being available in our companion apps and cloud data platform. Omnipod 5 PDMs will therefore include a SIM card. This enables every Omnipod user, even pediatrics without smartphones, and those without Wi-Fi to benefit from our companion apps that will provide real-time insulin and CGM data to caregivers, loved ones and clinicians. And all of this comes in a system that has been designed to be exceptionally easy to start and easy to use as evidenced by our remarkably high usability scores. We've also begun to work on what comes after Omnipod 5. We see the Type 1 pump market nearly doubling in the coming years as more users discover the ease of use and clinical benefits of second generation AID systems like Omnipod 5 and beyond. And we see enormous opportunity to serve those living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, given our unique form factor and pharmacy access. So we are investing to serve these growing markets. We are investing in next generation technologies and in demonstrating the benefits of Omnipod 5 in expanding populations, including very young pediatrics and people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. We are advancing our algorithm to increase automation, improve outcomes and further simplify the experience for users. And we are continuing to integrate our products with next generation technologies from our partners at Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool, all with the goal to reduce burden and improve outcomes for the millions of people living with insulin dependent diabetes across the globe. Now turning to our progress in our international markets; this area of our business has been more heavily impacted by the pandemic and we are seeing a slower recovery in some European markets. This does not diminish our enthusiasm for our international opportunity, both in terms of continued growth in our existing markets and expansion into others with significant unmet need. We made good progress throughout the quarter, preparing our markets for the expansion of our Omnipod DASH launch. Our limited market release in the UK, Netherlands and Italy was successful and our customers love the product. The international team has been focused on training, market readiness and launch preparations, and we're looking forward to moving into full market release with Omnipod DASH early next year. And finally, turning to operational excellence; for the last four years, we have been strengthening our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We have increased capacity and made our operations more resilient with the addition of our U.S. manufacturing plant to compliment our facility in China. This has served us especially well during the current pandemic. As many of you know, during the last 15 months, we began producing Omnipod on our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. Although the pandemic has had an impact on how quickly we've been able to ramp these lines, we continue to increase capacity and gain efficiencies throughout our global operations. In the near-term, this ensures we can deliver the highest quality product to each and every one of our customers. Over the long-term, our U.S. manufacturing will provide required capacity and support as demand for our products continues to grow. We plan to further expand our U.S. manufacturing capacity across our supply chain and manufacturing operations, to prepare for what we are confident will be enthusiastic demand for Omnipod 5. As part of our corporate sustainability goals, we have taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of our supply chain and operations. To this end, we have localized a large portion of our supply chain to reduce logistics emissions. We also moved to ocean freight, which has the benefit of being both cost \u2013 more cost effective and more environmentally friendly. In June, as a further step, we transitioned our company headquarters and U.S. manufacturing facility to be fully powered by solar-based renewable energy. We understand the urgency and importance to protect our environment and reduce our carbon footprint. And we are committed to fostering a sustainable business to support the long-term wellbeing of our customers, our employees and our communities. In summary, while there are certainly short-term challenges that our business faces due to COVID, our team is rising to these challenges in remarkable ways. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation and differentiation and are key to our ability to continue to deliver attractive growth in these uncertain times. Our investments in product and business model innovations and our talented dedicated team, position us over the long-term to drive strong organic growth and value creation and to bring powerful new technologies to market; and most importantly, to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Great. Thanks, Larry. So in terms of iOS, we have not guided any timeframe there, only to say, that we fully expect to follow our initial launch on Android with iOS. So that work is underway and is that timeline becomes more clear, we'll communicate that out. First, we want to get Omnipod 5 to market, which is coming soon. And in terms of a price premium, and we also haven't given much insight into our price strategy. The one thing, I will highlight though, is we are entirely committed to a pay-as-you-go model in the United States with Omnipod 5. And so what that means is all of our existing DASH users will be able to transition to Omnipod 5 without having to worry about a lock-in period or having to pay some sort of upgrade fee. Now that doesn't mean that Omnipod 5 doesn't warrant a premium, because obviously, the performance in terms of hypoglycemia and other key performance indicators certainly deliver value to the market and so that's what's being evaluated. But we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And that's important for us because as we think about the pace of innovation increasing in the market, we want to be positioned to be able to deliver that innovation most quickly to our customers and not make them wait out these industry warranty periods, et cetera. So that we're committed to and we'll see on the price premium. Yes. You're seeing it the way we see it Robbie. We see this pretty significant technology inflection happening in Type 1 and actually beginning to happen in Type 2. So I think a lot of this is driven by adoption of CGM. And then, of course, we know that there's going to be great demand. It's one of the most anticipated developments in the pipeline with Omnipod 5. And so we do see that, we've always said, we thought 50% was a pretty reasonable estimate for penetration into the pump market because you just needed to look at pediatrics. But we're seeing even pediatrics expand utilization of pumps in Type 1 pretty rapidly. And then I think this expansion of CGM has really driven more adoption too. So we do see that as a realistic TAM for us and an exciting one. And then we look at CGM, penetrating into Type 2s now, for us, that's just pipeline. We see a tremendous opportunity to bring Omnipod 5 to people living with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And I would say, we have the right to win in both of those markets. We have the specific obviously, really differentiated form factor advantages, and really excited about what integration with our sensor partners will bring to both of those populations. That's right, Robbie. We are not worried. I just always take the opportunity because we have such a different business model relative to obviously other insulin pump players out there. Just to educate on that. And Wayde, I don't know if you have any other color you want to add regarding the Street estimates. Sure. Yes, David and you've hit on it. The recovery that we're seeing in Europe is definitely more modest than what we're seeing in the U.S. today. And it is very much varied across the markets. Some are doing okay. And then others like France, which is obviously an important market for us is still very challenged. As hospitals don't open and many of those new patients would be served by the prestataire and they are occupied with other priorities. And so it's kind of a tale of multiple parts across Europe. And the other area that is more challenged is endo visits. And so there's been slower uptake of telehealth in Europe and many larger European markets see their Omnipod or new pump starts in hospital, the clinics rather than in private offices. And so obviously, hospitals are really challenged right now in many parts of the world. So I think, we're seeing encouraging things across all of our markets in terms of \u2013 endo visits starting to reopen in terms of our pipeline and new starts. But we're not back to normal still know that endo visits even in the United States are not back to where they were pre-COVID levels. So it's encouraging, but in the \u2013 in Europe, we are forecasting that it will be a much more moderate recovery from here through the rest of the year. Sure, Jeff. Yes. So, when I talk about adaptability, I'm really referring to other systems that are in the market, where the \u2013 there are still many dobbs \u2013 knobs and dials to adjust on these systems in terms of various inputs regarding, for example your basal rate or your total daily dose, or your insulin to carb ratio, such that, if the algorithm and the system is not working aggressively enough or in a satisfactory way for the patient that they have to go back into the physician and have adjustment made in order for the system to work more effectively for them. Our system and the algorithm has really been designed to grow and learn with the patient and consciously, we've taken a lot of those knobs and dials away, so that the system can actually do its job and simply adapt and perform better for the patient. And so that really, the goal there is to make it much easier, both for the clinician and for the patient, and to rely on the algorithm, to grow with the user. So, there are examples of, if the user adopts a new exercise routine, that means that their insulins, they require potentially less insulin. The system is designed to notice that and to learn and adjust; same thing with children as they get older, they may require more insulin. The system is designed to see that and adjust to that. So that's what we're really excited about what adaptability will bring. We're also really excited just about the flexibility of the system. We've talked about customizable set points and other things with the system that should make it just incredibly user-friendly. And I think that was demonstrated at ADA when the moderator compared our usability scores to iPhones. I mean, that's really how simple the system is designed to be. Coming out of ADA, I think, what would be noticeable is just that we're in this sort of technology adoption and pace of technology increasing in the market for people living with diabetes. It's just a really exciting time. I mean, there were multiple AID systems, multiple next generation sensors presented. And so when we think about, what that could bring to people living with the disease, it's very exciting. To me, it's part of why we remain so bullish on adoption of technology among people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And obviously, we're really excited about the role that we'll play in that. I think this year's ADA, if you just looked at the enthusiasm, I think there were thousands and thousands of physicians, who had dialed into to listen to our presentations. There's just tremendous enthusiasm for automated insulin delivery and what it will bring to the community. Sure, sure. I think that's a great question. We're thinking a lot about that right now. We've been \u2013 obviously; I highlighted it in my remarks. We've been already thinking about, how do we build capacity and be in a position to be a very strong from an inventory position. The next steps for us outside of getting through our clinical work and securing clearance are to really think about market access. As I mentioned with Larry at the first question, we are committed to this pay as you go model. And so what that means is that everybody will be able to transition to Omnipod 5, as soon as they have access. We're not going to regulating this with a four-year warranty period or upgrade fees or anything like that, which means there's going to be tremendous demand both among our existing users and what we anticipate to be tremendous demand among new users. And a lot of that will be regulated by access. And so our teams are already now thinking about how do they rapidly expand access, particularly in our pharmacy channel. I think we're very fortunate, because we did all of the work to really establish our \u2013 both the new business model, the new wholesaler distribution and the pharmacy access. And so this should go much more smoothly and much more rapidly than it did with DASH. And actually, it went very well with DASH. But that work is already underway as well. And then we've had a lot of work going on around onboarding and training of patients, which is why we were ahead of the game in terms of being able to launch all of our virtual tools with Omnipod during the pandemic. But what's great about the experience that we've had is that we know that patients of all sorts of demographics can be very happily and successfully trained at home. And we had less of an experience before the pandemic. Now, we know it for certain across all patient demographics. And so that sets us up, I think, for a lot of success rapidly and cost-effectively being able to bring patients onto Omnipod 5. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. It is something we're thinking about. it's difficult to predict obviously. But we do know that endo; in the U.S., where we have the most visibility. We do know that endo visits are down still significantly. And so \u2013 and then there's a portion that's just happening by a telehealth, people are less likely, and physicians are less likely to transition to new technologies via telehealth than they are in in-person visits. So, I do think that there is this dynamic, where people who probably need better technology and better care are not getting it today. And that's really concerning, frankly, because it's a vulnerable population as it relates to COVID. And so I will do everything that we can to educate the community, educate clinicians about this and that there's, it's very easy to transition to get a prescription to be able to trial the device and be able to get started at home. And there may very well be a bolus of people. we are not counting on it. But certainly, I hope that everybody who needs care is getting it, or we'll get it soon as the economy start to continue to reopen. So, I'll start with the first part and then maybe Wayde can comment although I don't know how much insight we have yet into sort of the cost differential or the impact on margin. I will say that just feedback from both clinicians, who have attended trainings in some cases with their patients that we're hosting virtually as well as directly from new customers has been absolutely fantastic regarding virtual training. And one of the pieces of the feedback is that it's just much easier to schedule in everybody's life. And so certainly, we see an easier time getting scheduled and we can also leverage our field team better in terms of being able to automatically schedule them and have people support multiple areas or multiple territories. And so I think all of those things bode well and we view this, as I said very much as not just a temporary thing that we're doing to support patients and clinicians during COVID. but as a viable, very exciting way that we can scale our Omnipod 5 training and delight customers, because it's clear that people love being trained in the comfort of their own homes. Sure. Margaret, I think it's a good question. I actually think we've learned a lot, because of DASH. I mean, we've seen a great uptake in this patient population as a result of the simplicity of the platform and just how powerful pharmacy access is. In that experience and understanding how that user segment is using DASH has given us insight into how Omnipod 5 five and future generations of omnipod 5 could be impactful in that population. So, I don't want to reveal too much there from a competitive standpoint, but I will say that you'll see us start the clinical work just to evaluate our technology in that population. And I think we'll learn even more then, and we're confident based on our experience with DASH and based on the fact that more and more people living with insulin dependent type 2 are adopting CGM, that we have a great technology to bring to that market. Sure. That's great. Thanks. And then your question regarding Omnipod 5 five. So as I mentioned in my remarks, all of our patients will be completed or all participants will be completed with the Omnipod 5 study at the \u2013 by Q4. And then we don't \u2013 just as general practice, we don't give estimates on submission, but that timing of completion of participants in the trial gives us great confidence in our limited market release in the first half of 2020. And then in terms of data, we've been invited to share our data at ATTD. So we will definitely expect to do that, as that takes place in February, and is likely to be a virtual conference. Yes. So I think we're in a good spot because what this is, is an amendment to existing contracts, as opposed to what we had to accomplish with DASH, where we had to go build the relationships and then go establish contracts and pricing in terms with all of our payers. So we are way ahead of the game on that front. But we do plan to use the data to be able to establish a reimbursement with our payers. And so that data will hopefully be available shortly after, our patients or our participants complete the trial in Q4. And I would imagine that the end of 2020, beginning of 2021, our teams are working very hard on establishing access for Omnipod 5. No, Jayson, you're hitting on a really important point and this is the debate that's going on internally currently. We know that the performance of Omnipod 5 demands a premium. It's a product that delivers pretty remarkable outcomes for users. What we're going to be weighing that against and where there's a lot of analysis going on right now is, the trade off there is just how quickly we can establish access. And so that's the work that's underway with the teams right now, and we have not yet shared. And I'm not even sure we've landed completely, but shared where we plan to be with a premium. But the access will happen very quickly or much more quickly, if we don't have a premium or we have a minimal premium, and it will take a much slower ramp if we decide to attach a premium to it. So that's the rub. Thanks, Matt for the question, I really \u2013 I think it's durable to the extent that the pandemic is durable. So I don't know that it changes the trajectory significantly, it's really great to see the power of the pod in drug delivery. But it's probably not an area that we see changing dramatically. And I maintain that, right now it's very difficult to see any opportunities that are more attractive than the massive growing market that is before us in diabetes. We see just the CGM and technology adoption is at this inflection point and we're on the cusp of launching Omnipod 5, and so that's where we're focused. Thanks, Matt. Great. Thank you. Despite the continuing effects of the pandemic Insulet delivered strong operational and financial performance, and our team continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt quickly to challenges and execute on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. So to all of our employees, I want to thank you for your relentless hard work and dedication. I'm incredibly proud of how we've rallied together to support one another and to ensure we continue to advance our mission. Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the remainder of the year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me are Shacey Petrovic, president and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  The replay of this call will be archived on our website and the press release discussing our first quarter 2020 results and second quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. We have transitioned to these measures as they align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period-to-period. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last few months have posed extraordinary challenges for countries and communities around the world as we've grappled with the impact of COVID-19. Our hearts go out to those whose health has been affected and our gratitude goes out to the many medical professionals and first responders on the front-lines. We also hope that all of you joining us on today's call are staying safe and healthy. As a company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes, the safety and well-being of our Insulet employees and the communities and Podders we serve, have been our top priorities as we navigate these difficult circumstances. In March, we transitioned to remote work arrangements for the vast majority of employees, in line with guidance issued by the WHO, CDC, local governments and health authorities. For those employees performing critical on-site functions, we significantly enhanced safety procedures to include social distancing, PPE protocols, frequent deep cleaning of our facilities and temperature monitoring. I am pleased to report that this transition has been essentially seamless and on behalf of our leadership team, I'd like to express our sincere gratitude to the employees who are continuing to work on-site to ensure we can provide uninterrupted supply of Omnipod to our customers. I am incredibly proud of our global teams\u2019 resilience and compassion in the face of this challenge.  While balancing many other demands like working from home, caring for children and keeping their families and friends healthy, our dedicated employees have never lost focus on our mission. Our Insulet team is what makes us such a great company and I want to thank each and every one of our employees across the globe.  I'd also like to thank our many supply chain partners for supporting our ability to build excess capacity and redundancy to ensure we can serve our customers without interruption and without delay. Notwithstanding the difficult external environment that began to affect our international business in February and U.S. market in March, we achieved first quarter revenue of almost $200 million, representing a 25% increase, driven by 34% revenue growth in our total diabetes product line.  This performance is a testament to both our execution and the strength of our recurring revenue business model. We were well positioned coming into the crisis having ended 2019 in a position of strength with healthy inventory levels, a strong balance sheet, robust global manufacturing operations and plans to capitalize on our growth prospects. We started 2020 with global Omnipod revenue near all-time highs and in the first quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. In the face of new obstacles, we\u2019ve responded quickly and effectively, maintaining our focus on execution and we delivered financial results exceeding our expectations. While the impacts of COVID are difficult to predict, after a careful consideration and scenario planning, we have decided to maintain our annual guidance, although, we expect to come in at the low-end of the range we previously provided. Our unique business model is a key differentiator, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base.  Therefore, while the current environment is unusually challenging, we believe our 2019 and Q1 2020 momentum will provide insulation. This gives us confidence that even in the face of this [Indiscernible] revenue at the mid-teens rate in 2020.  Wayde will provide more detail. But assuming market dynamics normalize early next year, we also believe we can maintain our $1 billion revenue goal for 2021. Importantly, our relative strength in the near-term allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives that will drive growth over the longer-term. These investments will ensure that over the coming years, Insulet makes significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We will bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market.  Our business model innovation will ensure cost-effective access to the broadest population of users across the globe and our investment in operational excellence will ensure supply chain resiliency, world-class manufacturing capabilities, and industry-leading gross margins. There is much work to be done to realize our vision and in 2020, we will continue to make significant progress. This year, we are focused on driving four key initiatives forward. One, deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization.  Our team has done a remarkable job quickly adjusting in the face of COVID-19 and despite the challenges of working remotely, we do not expect an impact of more than a couple of quarters on our execution timelines. Engineers are finding creative ways to innovate in their newly virtual teams, sales calls are happening via Webex and our manufacturing and supply teams are ensuring we meet our growing customer demand without missing a beat. I'll now walk through our Q1 progress on each of these key initiatives, starting with delivering a consumer-focused innovation. During the first quarter, we continued to grow the number of Omnipod DASH users, driven by both the intuitive simplicity of its platform and our unique pay-as-you-go business model through the pharmacy channel.  By eliminating complexity and restrictions, we are making Omnipod more accessible to a broader range of customers. Omnipod is differentiated, particularly in a down economy because it has no upfront cost.  This is also helpful to Insulet, creating a high degree of insulation through our recurring revenue durable annuity model. In this first quarter, we continued to increase coverage for Omnipod DASH, which helped grow the number of customers accessing Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy. As of the end of Q1, we had secured Omnipod coverage in the United States for over 50% of Medicare and approximately 70% of Medicaid beneficiaries. And we've seen a notable tick-up in commercial coverage for DASH, with DASH now covered for over 60% of commercially insured lives.  In the first quarter, approximately one-third of our U.S. new Omnipod starts were Type 2, primarily Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy channel. As a result of this strong growth and expanding market access, our U.S. new Omnipod starts represented another record Q1. With last year's launch of Omnipod DASH, we created our online training program for DASH customers transitioning from Omnipod. This enables users to get started via online training without the need to leave home or meet with a clinician for support. Thanks to DASH's simplicity. This web-based training has been a success and today, it is being used extensively to support thousands of users.  And in fact, many users transitioning from Omnipod to DASH just rely on the intuitive user interface, which provides step-by-step instructions to get started. These tools were created to support effective scaling of our business and have proven to be exceptionally helpful in our current environment. In addition, in response to the pandemic, our team worked quickly to expand and enhance our program to include virtual training for new users that still want support from a clinician. The virtual training and support capabilities we have built across our global business have allowed us to successfully service existing customers and to onboard new customers, even those that are brand-new to pump therapy. In fact, over the last several weeks in our direct markets, which represent about half of our business, we have on-boarded approximately 2,000 new users via virtual training with Insulet clinical trainers. And about 80% of these were MDI users new to pump and pod therapy. We have also seen our distributors and intermediaries implement great virtual training programs.  Last week, I personally observed one of these trainings via Webex and it was a remarkable experience. Our Clinical Training Manager walked a Podder, 7-year-old Colton and his parents through the setup and pod activation of Omnipod DASH. They were transitioning from multiple daily injections.  The training was thorough, effective, and the family was clearly at ease receiving it in the comfort of their own home and it was absolutely wonderful to see the delight on Colton's and his mom's faces when they learned about DASH's food library and temp basal capabilities, and when they experienced putting on their very first pod. It was a clear reminder of just how simple and accessible Omnipod is. We have made great strides in delivering a best-in-class customer experience. We are constantly making it easier for users to try Omnipod and access it from a convenient pharmacy. We had much of this work underway in order to support our rapid growth and our goal to deliver the best global customer experience.  Telemedicine, virtual training tools and the convenience of pharmacy access will continue to deliver appealing, scalable customer experiences.  While we remain encouraged by the momentum of Omnipod DASH, we have seen a slowdown of new Omnipod starts globally. This intensified in March, as many people delayed non emergency doctor visits due to COVID-19 and we expect to face the strongest new start headwinds in the second quarter.  It is obviously difficult to predict the timing and extent to which COVID will impact our business. We don't know how long our customers will be challenged meeting with their physicians or precisely how much our telehealth capabilities will offset this impact.  Our guidance assumes the pandemic's recessionary headwinds will persist throughout 2020, followed by a gradual recovery starting in the third quarter, as economies begin to reopen and physician and patient interactions begin to normalize. We are presently assuming market dynamics return to normal starting in 2021. In addition to ensuring the safety of our employees and continuity of supply to our Podders, our team has found ways to give back to our communities. We have participated in PPE donation programs to local healthcare facilities and gifted computer equipment to support remote schooling needs in our communities.  And I am particularly proud that in response to the significant economic impact of COVID-19, we have broadened our financial assistance program to ensure those who rely on Omnipod can remain on product if they lose insurance coverage.  This is a robust program designed to help address the unique healthcare affordability challenges for U.S. Omnipod users, who lose coverage due to COVID-19 and are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid. For these users, we will provide up to six months of pods at zero cost through the end of 2020. Throughout the first quarter, we continued our work to develop our next-generation product, Omnipod powered by Horizon. We remain highly confident that Omnipod Horizon, the first tubeless, personal, smartphone-controlled automated insulin delivery system will be a game changer for people living with diabetes.  As you know, we paused the Horizon trial at the beginning of March in order to address a software anomaly. I am pleased to report that we have successfully completed the software update and has been sent to the FDA for review. Given anticipated agency review times and newly required logistics at our trial sites, we are now tracking to bring Omnipod Horizon to the U.S. market in the first half of 2021.  We are fortunate to benefit from the enthusiastic support of our trial sites and participants and expect that all sites and virtually all patients will continue in the trial. That said, COVID-19 presents some challenges to how we support and monitor the trial and this likely will add a few months to our timelines. The team has reacted quickly, proposing updated protocols to the FDA to ensure virtual follow-up and support and our interactions with the agency continue to be collaborative and helpful.  We look forward to resuming the trial and we know our study participants are eagerly awaiting the benefits of simple, automated insulin delivery provided by Omnipod Horizon. In addition to our progress with Omnipod Horizon, the team has continued to advance our collaborations with Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool. Over the coming years, these partnerships will bring exciting new products to market that will deliver reduced burden and improved outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We also continued to advance our existing platforms to bring even more value to our customers. This year, we will build-out Omnipod DASH with various new languages to further expand globally and we will deliver DASH with remote upgrade capabilities, including secure cloud-to-cloud integration through Glooko, enabling additional ease of use and telemedicine capabilities. And development work is underway on mobile phone platform extensions for Omnipod Horizon such as iOS. Now, turning to our global expansion. As a result of the progress we made capitalizing on our direct operations in Europe, we have strengthened our presence in many of our large underserved existing markets.  We entered into a limited commercial release of Omnipod DASH in three European markets at the end of 2019 and had planned to further roll out DASH in Europe and Canada and to enter five new international markets.  We are eager to expand into new geographies and DASH has been well received in the markets in which we've launched it. COVID-19, however, presents some uncertainty in terms of market readiness, training and preparedness of our teams and partners, as well as regulatory and market clearances.  We believe these dynamics delay our DASH and market expansion efforts into early 2021, as we work to ensure the markets are prepared for successful DASH launches and market expansions. These impacts are temporary and we continue to view global expansion as an exciting multiyear growth driver for Insulet. Lastly, I will address our manufacturing innovation and ongoing efforts to drive global operational excellence. Several years ago, we began taking steps to strengthen our global supply chain. We focused on building redundancy with our U.S. manufacturing capabilities to supplement our capacity in China, as well as create redundancy throughout our entire global supply chain.  The importance of this effort was highlighted as we worked to maintain production continuity in the face of COVID-19, first in China, and then in the United States. I am very proud of the incredible work our team has done to ensure we are producing above planned product levels, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our global employees. We are laser-focused on making sure our customers receive continued uninterrupted access to Omnipod. This pandemic is the challenge of our lifetimes, but we will emerge stronger and better for it. Already at Insulet, it is driving us to improve systems, enhance telemedicine capabilities and further strengthen our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Insulet is rising to this incredible challenge and there is no other team I would rather work with and rely on to see us through to the other side.  We remain focused on executing our strategy to continue creating value for shareholders. And we remain focused on our mission to improve the lives of people living with diabetes even in the most difficult of times. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thank you, Shacey. These are challenging times as we deal with the ongoing global health crisis, and I'd like to also say, thank you to the Insulet team, who has shown incredible adaptability, as we have all adjusted to a new mode of operating. And well wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19.  We are certainly not immune to the headwinds created by the pandemic. However, as Shacey stated, we are fortunate to have a durable annuity model with the vast majority of revenue generated in any given quarter coming from our existing customer base.  The current global environment is disrupted, but it does not change the significant market opportunity we have and we remain well positioned for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are confident in our ability to continue creating significant value for our shareholders while advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We achieved another strong quarter of financial and operating performance in Q1. The execution of our strategic imperatives is paying off and we continue to invest for growth. As a reminder, the revenue growth rates I will discuss on this call are on a constant currency basis.  In the first quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 25.3%, approximately $7 million above our quarterly guidance range. This strong growth was driven by our global diabetes business, which grew 34% and was $10.5 million above our guidance range.  We were able to achieve these results as our global operations and commercial teams did a tremendous job quickly adjusting to the constraints caused by COVID-19.  The operations team put measures in place early in the quarter, as we learned of challenges ramping back up our China manufacturing facility in January and the commercial team acted quickly later in March as regional lockdowns were implemented to switch to more telehealth activity.  As a result, we've been able to deliver product to customers without interruption and we are producing above historic levels with volume contribution from our new U.S. manufacturing plant, all while keeping a keen focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and delivering products to our customers. By product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 35.4%, $5.6 million above our guidance range and represented the highest growth rate we have achieved in our first quarter in over five years.  Our increasing customer base and growing adoption of Omnipod DASH, primarily through the pharmacy channel, continue to be the main drivers of outperformance, along with a mix benefit for the premium on Omnipod DASH.  In the quarter, we experienced an easing of the seasonal impact of Q1 deductible resets given our shift to the pharmacy and we also benefited from an estimated $4 million of end-customer stocking due to COVID-19. As a reminder, we began generating revenue for DASH at the start of the second quarter of last year. So our 2020 first half growth rate will benefit from annualizing the first full year of Omnipod DASH and our move into the pharmacy. In the first quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH drove over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts and we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to almost 30% of our total.  International Omnipod revenue grew 31.9%, $5 million above our guidance range. International also benefited from an estimated $2 million of channel stocking orders due to COVID-19 late in the quarter.  Drug Delivery revenue declined 50% and was below our guidance range. This was due to a shift in timing of production, which you will see is reflected in the greater-than-normal revenue growth we expect from this product line in the second quarter.  Overall, we are pleased with our strong revenue growth in the first quarter and start to the year, despite beginning to see a slowdown in new Omnipod customers in March. Turning to gross margin, we delivered 64.1% in the quarter, down 280 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially, including a 160 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-19-related costs, as well as a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from FX.  Also impacting gross margin was the continued impact of ramping production at our new U.S. manufacturing facility, with our second manufacturing line starting production in early March.  Partially offsetting the gross margin headwinds were the continued improvements through our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We were well prepared for this difficult situation given our complete supply chain redundancy strategies implemented over the last several years. The incremental 2020 costs we are incurring to maintain the safety of employees and the quality of our products and to ensure we produce ahead of demand is critically important during this time. We are pleased to be producing sellable product on our second U.S. manufacturing line and as we've previously communicated, it means we will incur a headwind to gross margin as we ramp. With the recent shift in focus to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts, we are now assuming a slower ramp of our manufacturing lines. Once fully operational, our U.S. manufacturing facility and lower landed cost of goods will drive gross margin expansion over the long-term.  Operating expenses in the first quarter were 60% of revenue, compared to 62% in the prior year, in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 12.3%. Regarding our cash and liquidity status, we are in a favorable cash position with no debt maturing until 2024 at the earliest and very low cash interest expense. At the end of the first quarter, we had $382 million in cash and investments, compared to $435 million at the end of last year.  This sequential decrease was primarily driven by our use of cash in order to invest for growth, including planned capital expenditures for our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a result of the recent refinancing of our convertible debt, we have a favorable debt profile with no near-term maturities and no restrictive covenants.  In summary, we have the cash position and favorable financing structure we need to profitably grow our business. Turning to our 2020 guidance. We are in an unprecedented time with the dynamic COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties it is creating. As we communicated in our earnings release, and as Shacey stated, we are maintaining our revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range.  We have the benefit of the durability of our recurring revenue model, which provides the vast majority of our revenue from our existing customer base. Historically, new Omnipod starts within any given quarter contributed approximately 10% of revenue. It is difficult to accurately predict the progression of COVID-19 and the extent of the resulting depth or length of the disruption.  However, we want to provide you with the key metrics for our business and underlying assumptions as we track them during this time. We have developed a set of assumptions, based on what we have experienced through April and what we understand about the macro environment. If our base assumptions are either too high or too low, we are well prepared to manage through the multiple scenarios.  As noted, we are assuming that the most significant impact will be on new global Omnipod starts in the second quarter with gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, assuming economies around the globe begin to reopen. As a result of a reduction in new Omnipod starts in Q2 and an assumed continued headwind in the second half of the year, we expect a compounding effect on revenue growth to mostly impact the second half of the year.  As compared to our previous expectations at the start of the year, we are now assuming quarterly reductions in our global new Omnipod starts of approximately 50% to 75% in the second quarter, approximately 50% in the third quarter and approximately 25% in the fourth quarter.  We are also assuming some downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for expected recessionary headwinds. Given our no-charge PDMs and pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy, we feel we are well positioned in the \u2013 if the market becomes more cost-sensitive.  This allows patients to adopt pod therapy for their diabetes management without the large upfront cost or the challenge of a four year lock-in period. We have also established a set of leading indicators and are monitoring our data more frequently to adjust to different scenarios as they play out in this challenging time. For our total company 2020 revenue guidance, we now expect approximately 15% growth, which is at the low end of the range we've previously provided. By product-line, we have slightly adjusted guidance. We now expect total Omnipod revenue growth of approximately 18%, at the low end of our prior guide.  For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 19%, near the low end of our prior guidance and for international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 16%, which is below our prior guidance.  Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect to land in the middle of the range we previously provided of a 15% to 20% decline based on our partners' current forecasts. Now turning to the rest of the P&L on a full year basis, for gross margin, we now expect the full year to be approximately 63%, compared to our prior expectation of approximately 65%. This factors in our forecasted reduction in volumes and related lower revenue forecast due to COVID-19, as well as an estimated $5 million to $10 million of additional one-time costs related to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts.  Also factored into our gross margin estimate is a slower ramp in our new U.S. manufacturing lines, as timing has been impacted by the shift in focus for the operations team to mitigate the risks related to pandemic safety, as well as supply chain continuity. And, to a lesser extent, the assumed cost of our enhanced financial assistance program. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with prior year. We will continue to invest in our innovation pipeline, expand our global commercial initiatives and invest in U.S. manufacturing. Lastly, we are reaffirming our expectation of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low end of the range. For 2021, as Shacey stated earlier, if our base assumptions hold for 2020 and we see market conditions stabilize in 2021, we will remain on track to deliver our revenue target of $1 billion.  For our 2021 gross margin target, as a result of the pandemic impact to volume and U.S. manufacturing ramp, we now expect a range of 67% to 70%. We still see a pathway to our original 70% target.  However, there are many scenarios that can play out. So we feel it's prudent to provide a wider range at this time. In no way does it change our confidence that we will achieve 70% gross margin over time.  Finally, we are reaffirming our expectation of 2021 operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low-end of the range. In summary, we started the year with higher-than-expected performance in Q1 and with our resilient business fundamentals and base assumptions, we believe Insulet is well positioned to sustain growth in 2020 and over the long-term. We remain focused on our strategic imperatives in delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. In closing, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted at this time. We are proud of our Insulet employees that have responded to this challenging situation and how they remain focused on our mission. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a really nice quarter. We've \u2013 in our checks with endocrinologists, we consistently hear that, pumps are a little harder to train remotely than CGM, but Omnipod stands out as being easier than other competitive pumps to train remotely, plus the cost to access and the cost to use is significantly lower, which bodes well during what should be a pretty tough economic time the next few months or longer here.  So how are you thinking in terms \u2013 I know most of your new patient starts come from MDI. But how are you thinking about your competitive positioning here going forward, both to patients to basically pay up before a pump, but also versus your competitors, where you might have a lot of benefits versus them? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic : Thanks, Robbie. Yes, I think you are right. Your data supports what we see, which is that we are \u2013 there are all sorts of things that make Omnipod a really appealing insulin delivery therapy for patients. And some of those things are even more powerful in an environment like the one we are in.  When you think about the move towards a more cost-conscious consumer in this really challenging economic environment, obviously, the fact that you don't have to pay upfront for Omnipod and you are not locked in to four years of therapy, those things are very appealing. But I think probably even more powerful than that is the simplicity of the platform.  And in some ways, telehealth just plays really perfectly into our strategy, because our whole goal is to bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market and if you think about what you need to be able to transition people in a telehealth environment, from multiple daily injections to a new technology, it's got to be simple.  And we've developed a technology that is simple enough for kids, simple enough for multiple daily injection users and one that really, if you think about it, has two components, no needles to handle, no infusion sets. So it's just a very simple technology to train on. And I think that differentiator is going to become more powerful in the environment that we are in today.  So, we feel good about this trend and I personally am really excited by the capabilities that we've built and expanded on in a really short period of time to be able to lean in during this time and really bring our technology to more people who need it.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Insulet stands out as having a lot of China manufacturing exposure. You touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks and you have done a great job ramping up with the new manufacturing facility. I believe, line one is up. Line two is on its way and line three is being built.  But how should we think about when you'll have much more dependence on the U.S. manufacturing versus outside the U.S. in case this lasts for much longer?\nWayde McMillan: Hi, Robbie, it's Wayde. I can take that one. And the team saw this risk several years ago when they laid out the multi-year strategy and obviously made a significant investment. I know you've seen it here as well.  And to your point, that's giving a lot of tailwinds to the team here during this current challenge that we've got two lines up and running now and producing and that's allowing us to actually build inventory through this time and so being able to stay ahead of demand and demand that's overachieving or outperforming our base scenarios. Regarding the risk in China, I mean, we've got a really strong partner in China. I think we are very impressed by how quickly they took on the challenge and we are able to staff, recruit, onboard, train and safely move people into the facility and get our production up. It was clearly delayed from a typical year-end start.  But, given the environment, we were impressed by how quickly both the third-party team and our operations teams work together. I highlighted here some of the costs. We've put some incentives in place to help fund some of the work that our third-party manufacturer was doing and some of the extent they were going to get employees into the facility to get producing for us again after the New Year.  So, I think we're going to see a multi-facility strategy from us going forward. And one of the main drivers for our U.S. manufacturing facility was to get redundancy and we'll have redundancy once we have three and four lines running here in the U.S. and keeping our China manufacturing facilities. So we'll achieve that objective once we get our third line up and then eventually onto our fourth line. Next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question coming from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. A couple of quick ones for me. Wayde, I appreciate all the great detail on new patient start impacts across the quarter. I wonder, just given that certain geographies are beginning to open up, certain regions in the U.S. are beginning to open up and we are seeing this growing impact to telemedicine here in April as it leads into May.  That quantification that you gave us across the quarters, that\u2019s sinking up as sort of the qualitative recovery you are seeing April into May? Or is it sort of slightly ahead or slightly behind?\nWayde McMillan: So, good afternoon, Dave. Yes, so \u2013 and thanks for bringing this one up, because we are hoping that we'd get an opportunity to give a little bit more context on it. Starting with the matching of our assumptions with the global economy and what we are starting to see in the macro environment with different countries and regions opening up. That's why we tied our base assumptions to this gradual improvement through the end of the year.  And clearly, we are expecting headwinds through the rest of the year. If it happens that regions open quicker and our customers and patients can get to meet with their physicians and get the therapies that they need to treat their disease sooner. We'll be ahead of those assumptions. But at this point, we're assuming that we'll continue to see these headwinds through the end of the year. And to the second part of your question, how does that compare or contrast to what we've seen in April? I'll use this as an opportunity just to help explain to people the impact of our model and it really shows the durability of our model, because the impact to Q2 is not really impacted that much by new patient starts.  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, approximately 10% of any quarter is due to new patient starts. And so, we're really benefiting from the strong second half of 2019 and strong performance into Q1. And what we've seen so far in April is, revenue continuing to perform well because we're benefiting from that momentum coming into Q2.  But behind that, we are seeing a slowdown in our new patient starts. And we really see that in two stages. We track our sales cycle in two main stages, sales leads and then actual new patient starts. So even in front of new patient starts, we are tracking our sales leads and that's where we saw a pretty acute drop-off in March.  And so, as that funnel coming into Q2 starts to get smaller, that's where we are seeing the impact and so that's going to impact May and June for the most part. So we are anticipating our new patient starts, although strong through April, will start to slow down here through May and June.  And then, it's our expectation that both given the ability for people to return to their endocrinologists and work on different strategies to improve their therapy, including pod therapy, we are assuming we'll gradually improve through the end of the year. And then, as Shacey highlighted, telehealth, we feel we are very well positioned.  Our teams were already working on telehealth initiatives, and we were training people virtually. But we have redoubled those efforts now in the face of this pandemic and we are doing, as Shacey said, thousands more and that's growing every day.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Wayde. Thanks. That's super helpful. And then maybe, Shacey, just one quick one for you, kind of also tied to recovery. But in the ex U.S. impacts, your forecasting is a little heavier than U.S., which makes sense given the different sites of service or how this healthcare is delivered in those two geographies. But how would you characterize the visibility into the U.S. recovery relative to the ex U.S. recovery? Thanks so much and great job. \nShacey Petrovic : Thanks, David. Yes, you are right, on ex U.S., just the way that care is delivered there, obviously, many more people living with diabetes get trained on new technologies like Omnipod in the hospital setting, as opposed to the clinic setting.  And so, we do anticipate it'll take a little bit longer for some of those markets to return towards normalcy and the headwinds are a little bit more significant. That said, we do have telehealth activities going on and virtual trainings going on in every international market, just like we do in every U.S. territory. And so, I think that's just the nature of what we are dealing with in the U.S. In terms of visibility, we have \u2013 we benefit in the U.S. from visibility to our direct customers and that helps give us a sense of what we can extrapolate across the markets. The same thing is true in Europe, although I think the insights into our direct patients aren't as easily extrapolated into additional markets.  So that's the challenge we have, is just how fragmented the European market is. But we work every day obviously with our partners and with our team to get those insights and as Wayde said, to be tracking those leading indicators, so that we can manage the business as effectively as we can during this time. Next question?\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon everybody and thank you for taking the question. One of the things that I am trying to get my head around is the patient or the new patient adds that aren't happening right now. When do they come back? And how do they come back?\nShacey Petrovic : Yes. I think it's a good question, Joanne. It's difficult obviously to predict the future. What our data shows is, and I'll speak mainly to the U.S., because that's where we have really the best insight. But what our data demonstrates is that, in the United States, endocrinologist visits are down 60% since the beginning of March.  And of that remaining 40% that are still happening, 15% of those are being delivered via telemedicine. So a pretty significant drop-off. What we see is just a more and more adoption of telemedicine across the United States. So I think that'll help offset it. And I think one of our questions is, how durable is telemedicine, because it's obviously dependent in some ways on reimbursement.  But we do track state-by-state new patient starts and as Wayde said, our leads in those markets to see in some of these areas that were hit harder than others, are they starting to recuperate? And so we see indications of that across various markets and that's what we'll continue to track so that we can continue to forecast.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you. And then my second question has to do with the international market, recognizing maybe it will be slower to open up new geographies. How do you think about approaching them? And does what's happening globally changed your view on what markets may be next or not? Thank you very much for taking the questions. \nShacey Petrovic : Thanks, Joanne. I don't think this impact today makes us feel differently about the new markets that we had planned to enter. Really, what's \u2013 what we are planning for is just to make sure that we have all of these markets prepared for successful launches. And so, in various markets, we might be, for example partnering with a strong distributor partner there.  We may be seeking market clearances or even regulatory approvals and we want to make sure that all of that stuff is in place before we launch into the market. And so that's really where we are \u2013 when we're thinking about different timelines and potentially early 2021 instead of 2020, it's really tied to making sure that we have everything prepared so that we can have successful launches.  Not that we are thinking about different territories at this point. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity, as I always say. We are really in a handful of countries relative to the rest of the world, and that's true even in Europe where we are starting to build a really strong presence there. There is still a tremendous amount of unmet need.  So we are going to attack that unmet need. It's just going to be a little bit later than we expected because of these dynamics.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. \nMalgorzata Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me, I guess, on the virtual training, I wanted to follow-up on that. I understand 15% of the 40% of patients or remaining were trained virtually. But as you look at that going forward, can you give us the advantages and disadvantages of that? For example, is it easier to get to a patient online or are there cheaper costs associated with that?\nShacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes. I think we're seeing a lot of advantages, frankly and not any disadvantages in terms of virtual training. I mean, I think there are always going to be some subset of patients who would prefer in a perfect world to be trained with a clinician or in a clinic.  But the feedback from patients on virtual training has been incredibly positive. People are describing it as simple. I can tell you from the one that I witnessed just on Friday that the patients were incredibly comfortable. The family was incredibly comfortable that we were able to get more insight into kind of how they operate by just seeing them at home.  And it was a very efficient, very effective training, so. and the feedback has been very positive. So I think this is a trend that will continue regardless of what happens with telemedicine. We are seeing a lot of positive feedback out of this. Our clinicians can be more efficient. Patients don't have to get into the clinic and the feedback has been very positive.  It's just so simple. You don't have a needle. You don't have \u2013 you have two components, and it's a really straightforward technology to walk a user through. So, it is ideally suited to virtual training.\nMalgorzata Kaczor: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then in terms of the patient leads and sales and marketing strategies in the interim, I've seen most of your patients at this point are coming from face-to-face visits with ENDOs and strategic discussions with ENDOs and so on.  But, are you going to change any of that strategy over the summer or kind of through year-end to maybe get patients through different channels like an online channel? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Margaret. I \u2013 first, I'll say that it's pretty remarkable to me that actually virtual sales calls are still happening with endocrinology offices and in many cases, ENDOs are really looking for information from us in terms of how we can support telehealth activities. I think earlier in February, we had a webinar focused on telemedicine with Omnipod and like 800 physicians attended that.  So there is a tremendous demand out there for this information and insight to how do you do this well, and we've got great resources to be able to support those discussions with ENDOs. So that isn't going away. But to your point, obviously, that's where the headwinds are coming from.  We have reallocated resources from a sales and marketing perspective, from things like conferences and travel and entertainment to a more digital outreach, direct-to-patients, to be able to engage them on: one, the benefits of Omnipod, and two, the fact that you can try it, risk-free and you can train all at home without needing to go into the clinic. And so it's early days, but we believe that message will resonate with patients.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Ryan Blicker of Cowen. Your line is open. \nRyan Blicker : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk a little bit more about what to assume within your revised Horizon timelines? When are you assuming the trial restarts? And then, do you still expect to conduct a limited market release prior to a full launch in the U.S.? Or do you believe you could broadly launch Horizon in the U.S. upon FDA approval?\nShacey Petrovic : Thanks, Ryan. So we are anticipating just a little bit of time, a few weeks of FDA review for the submission to restart the trial. And then, we've got to retrain sites, et cetera on just the virtual protocols for follow-up and monitoring of patients. And so, we think that's going to take a little bit of time, probably sometime into June, I would guess, before we restart the trial. And in terms of a limited market release, we will do a limited market release. It's best practice with any new technology to do a limited market release. We will do what we can to bring this technology as rapidly and through access and other methods to patients as quickly as possible because, we know there is a significant demand out there. But it is going to take us a little bit of time to get through the limited market release.\nRyan Blicker: Got it. Very helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this. But what proportion of the new patient starts in the U.S. were through the pharmacy in the quarter? And what proportion of your overall U.S. installed base is now going through the pharmacy? And do you believe the transition to the pharmacy could be accelerated at all in the U.S. due to COVID-19? Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic : I'll take maybe the pharmacy issues and then Wayde can talk about what percentage of our new starts. I am not sure if we gave that detail. But in terms of the overall base, we now have almost 30% of our U.S. customers going through the pharmacy.  And actually, when I think about how do we really scale this business, we've always been thinking about how do we help our customers get the best customer experience through self-service, through easier training, et cetera. And we've talked a lot about that. Our virtual training tools and our web-based training tools.  But the pharmacy is a big piece of this, too. This work was underway for us, because diabetes is an epidemic and endocrinology is in short supply. And so we need to innovate the business model to be able to ensure that we can meet this rapidly growing demand in this unmet need. And so, of course, all of the telemedicine stuff that we talked about is a piece of that.  But the other piece of that, if patients need care and potentially aren't in their physicians' offices frequently, the pharmacy could play a really exciting and really important role, because unlike your endocrinology office, there is a pharmacy on every corner and if we could leverage that channel to educate, inform, and support patients, that could be a much better customer experience.  And of course, it's a channel that we, right now, from an insulin delivery standpoint or insulin pump standpoint, own. And so, very \u2013 we see it as a worthy investment in a way to provide the best possible experience and the most cost-effective scaling commercially of our business.\nWayde McMillan: Hey, Ryan, it's Wayde. And just to add on there to round off your question. As Shacey said, our installed base in the pharmacy is at 30%. We didn't give exact pharmacy new patient starts. But DASH, we did and DASH is 60% of our new patient starts, almost all of those were through the pharmacy as well as type 2 has grown to be a third of our new patient starts and the majority of those are through the pharmacy as well.  So, DASH and type 2 are a big part of what's driving the volume growth now to the 30% going through the pharmacy.\nShacey Petrovic : It's great to see, too, just the progress we've made on establishing access through the pharmacy. It's a big piece of why we've been able to expand so much and in fact, just in the last month, we've even secured Cigna coverage in the pharmacy channel, which is \u2013 that's part of why we saw that tick-up in commercial coverage and part of what continues to drive adoption through the pharmacy channel.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is open. \nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Hey, Shacey, I wanted to follow-up maybe on the questions around new patient starts and the 50% to 75% decline in the second quarter and then the gating thereafter. Trying to triangulate that with your comments about the ease of use of prescribing through telehealth and that.  Do you think that 50% to 75% and then the third and fourth quarter numbers that you are giving, how do you feel like that compares maybe to the broader insulin pump market at this point? Are you guys doing better than? About the same as or worse than? Just given your comments on the ease of prescribing, I would think better than.  But just would love any kind of competitive intelligence you are hearing out in the field from your docs on what those numbers represent relative to market.\nShacey Petrovic : Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think I don't want to comment on kind of competitive pump businesses. But what we do know, just from IQVIA data and market \u2013 primary market research is that in the United States, ENDO visits are down 60% since the beginning of March. So I think that gives you a sense that this 50% to 75% number is probably right in line with what others are seeing.  And while we are, I would say, bullish on what kind of fit Omnipod is for telemedicine and we believe in that world we can lean in and do better than others. At the same time, we are relying on ENDOs to build telemedicine capabilities. So while we have kind of sped ahead and I think built some really exciting capabilities and support mechanisms for our ENDO offices, they are still across the globe.  Different clinics are in very different situations in terms of their capabilities to be able to support telemedicine. So, we're a little bit ahead of the curve, and we'll see how this plays out and how quickly ENDO offices across the globe, frankly, but particularly in the United States can start to implement and support telehealth for their patients.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is open. \nMatt Wizman: This is Matt Wizman on for Jayson. I appreciate all the color and visibility you guys have been giving. It's much appreciated. My question is on the type 2s. So now that there is been a bit more time with kind of a more substantial amount of type 2s in the base, have you noticed any change in the utilization or attrition dynamics with these types of users?  And then also, could you speak to the broader type 2 reimbursement environment on the commercial front, especially given how \u2013 on the CGM front, some payers have been a bit more friendly? Thanks. \nWayde McMillan : Great. Hey, Matt. I can \u2013 this is Wayde. I can answer the first part of the question and then hand it to Shacey for the second part. So, we have not seen a material change as type 2s have become a bigger part of our mix of products. Our utilization has stayed pretty steady through Q1 and also through the first month of April.  And in fact, one of the things that was on our radar when we set our annual guidance at the beginning of the year and one of the things that we thought could have pushed us to the lower end of our original guide was attrition, because, we had done a lot of new things, a new channel, a new product, a new business model with the pay-as-you-go model.  And so, we left ourselves some room in the original guide that we could see attrition tick up. And what we experienced in Q1 is actually our attrition ticked down a little bit. We performed very well in the first quarter with slightly better attrition than we had seen historically. So we're very happy about that.  As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, though, as we head into this more recessionary-driven environment, we are adding a tick-up in attrition and a tick-down in utilization, just because we don't know what the recessionary environment holds for us and we are going to start there and put that stake in the ground and then we'll monitor it as we go from here.\nShacey Petrovic : It\u2019s great, Wayde. And in terms of your second part of your question around reimbursement for the type 2 patients, one of the things we really like about the pharmacy channel is that there are \u2013 there isn't really a distinguishment between reimbursement for type 2 or type 1, if they require insulin. And so there are fewer restrictions.  It's a simpler channel to access your technology through and it really doesn't distinguish between type 1 or type 2, provided the patient is insulin-dependent and needs an insulin delivery mechanism. And then, of course, we always educate payers on the fact that Omnipod reduces total daily dose of insulin and provides very clear benefits for both patient segments.  And so, we've been fortunate to establish broad reimbursement through the pharmacy channel that doesn't distinguish between the two segments.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Travis Steed of Bank of America. Your line is open. \nTravis Steed: Congratulations on a strong Q1 and everything you're doing for patients. Wayde, I just wanted to make sure I fully understood the year-over-year reductions you gave in new patient starts. Were those reductions versus last year or versus your original guide?  And then, the change in the full year guide, it sounds like the majority of the change is coming from those new patient starts being lowered. I am just curious if there is any more color you could provide on what you are assuming on attrition and expansion of the patient support program.\nWayde McMillan : Yes. Hi, Travis. Thank you. So to the first part of the question on new patient starts, it is versus our guide and our previous expectations for 2020. And of course, those are estimates, right? We have really good visibility into Q2, as I mentioned, walking through the two-stage sales cycle there.  And really good visibility for Q2, obviously, in this environment, there is going to be more uncertainty for the second half and what that holds. But we thought it was important to just lay out these key metrics and put a stake in the ground, so that we can then help you understand the key drivers for our business here and then we can message to it as we go throughout the year. As far as the full year guide goes, the key is new patient starts. We think that, that will be the most significant metric to watch for. If we just pull up and think about our business model, we have this advantage of a durable recurring revenue model. And so even when we see new patients get impacted like we did in March and the inability for our customers to get to the ENDO office, I mean, it's a really unique dynamic and with that, the momentum of our business carries.  And so we've got really strong growth rates in Q1. We're putting a strong guide in for Q2 and what we have to manage then is this compounding of new patient starts. So if we go through two or three quarters of restrained new patient starts, that's going to weigh on our growth rate, especially given the tough comps we had, because we performed so well at the end of last year. So when we annualize into that tough comp, we are going to have to manage through some lower growth rates in the second half.  But then, as expected, when we see our new patient starts start to build momentum through the end of the year again and then assuming when we get back to normal or a new normal, which is, as Shacey talked about earlier, may involve more telehealth, but we get back to a more new \u2013 a new normal where we're getting a regular cadence of new patient starts, then the momentum builds again and we start to drive our growth rates even higher.  So, we felt it was important to really lay out that new patient start dynamic. And then the other key metrics that I mentioned, utilization and attrition. We have ticked down utilization a little bit, attrition up a little bit. But the major driver here is new patient starts. So for that, we are going to watch it.  We are going to certainly benefit from the durability of this model here in the first half of the year. We are going to track these key metrics through the second half and then hopefully, we'll all move beyond this pandemic and get back to business here in 2021.\nShacey Petrovic : And Travis, I'll just comment on your question regarding the patient assistance program. We don't look at that as hitting revenue, because these are patients who would not be able to afford the product anyways. And so I'm really, really proud of this program.  I am proud of the fact that Insulet was out front and that we can help support patients who otherwise might not be able to access the product. But we didn't view that as a revenue headwind, because those patients would have probably had traded off the product because they can't afford it.\nWayde McMillan : Okay. Operator, we are over time. But why don't we try to get through at least one, maybe two more, please?\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Matt O'Brien of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. \nAndrew Stafford: Hi guys. This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking the question here. I wanted to start off a little bit on your sales channels a little bit. I believe you said about 30% of your volume was due to the pharmacy. Appreciate that color. And definitely should help you in this type of environment.  But I guess, diving in on the other 70% of the business, are there any barriers presented by this epidemic outside of patient willingness, that kind of thing that could limit the patient access through the DME, be it\u2019s availability, people not being able to process paper work, anything like that?\nShacey Petrovic : I think one of the challenges in the DME channel is the limitation of access for people living with type 2 diabetes. So that's one area where we likely will not see access or availability. And then, I am not sure about the others. We haven't really seen trends that would indicate that there is a particular challenge with the DME environment that isn't being experienced in the pharmacy channel with the exception of type 2 access.\nWayde McMillan : Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is open. \nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a strong quarter. Two questions for me. One is, the delays on new patient starts and kind of the assumptions you are seeing in guidance, I appreciate the commentary around the decline in ENDO visits. But maybe just help us understand maybe the \u2013 what the falloff is like from leads to starts. Are you seeing bottlenecks more on the training side?  Is it more from a patient resources and economic side, just not wanting to commit to a pump at this time?  And then, just second question, I will ask it now, is just, what have you learned through this telemedicine and virtual training process that you think can \u2013 that you can apply towards Horizon launching and patient onboarding from that perspective as far as bringing down barriers to adoption and just improving the overall ease of use in the pump ecosystem from a longer-term perspective? Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic : Great. I think Wayde can take the first part of your question and I'll address the second.\nWayde McMillan : Sure. Sounds good. So we typically see a few weeks to a month lag between our sales leads, and then leading into our new patient starts. And so, as I mentioned, we saw the decline in sales leads really hit in March.  But our teams have done \u2013 this is in direct reference to Shacey's prepared remark, where she talked about the ability for the team to transition to working remotely and working through telehealth and we've done a great job through the end of March and into April transitioning what was in the pipeline into new patient starts.  And so, when we guide to a reduction in new patient starts of 50% to 75% for Q2, it is a result of looking at that sales lead pipeline, what happened to it in March, what we've seen happen to it in April and what we are calculating will be the impact in May and June. So that's the way the math works on that one. So from a training perspective, that you mentioned, Kyle is, our teams are doing a great job. As Shacey said, we are into the thousands in the first few weeks and ramping every day. And that's both U.S. and OUS.  The IT teams have worked with the marketing teams to rapidly learn what are the bottlenecks \u2013 worked with the HCPs to find out what are the bottlenecks and these teams every day are clearing hurdles, and we are getting more efficient at being able to train people virtually.\nShacey Petrovic : And I think on your question tied to what have we learned about Horizon, I mean we continue to learn every day. But I'll tell you that the most exciting thing from my perspective about Horizon is that, it really has been designed from the outset to be the simplest technology on the market and so that will lend itself very, very well to a telehealth environment.  And the other great thing about Horizon, besides its simplicity, is that there is real-time access to cloud data. And so that will be \u2013 that should enable some really easy and effective interactions between patients and physicians, whether they are happening in the clinic or in particular, if they are happening via telemedicine.\nWayde McMillan : Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Danielle Antalffy of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. \nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Congrats on a really strong quarter. It's good to see. I had a quick question on attrition and sort of what you are seeing or what, I guess, you saw in the last few weeks of the quarter. I know you have this patient assistance program. How you are seeing that be utilized? And yes, I guess, maybe let's start there.\nWayde McMillan : Sure. So I can start, if you like, Shacey. And I just mentioned to a previous question there that through Q1, actually attrition was a little better than we've had historically. And so, in the face of the pay-as-you-go model where we thought we could see some higher attrition. We actually saw lower attrition.  As we get more acute into the month of March, it becomes harder to know if someone's actually attrited. It takes a bit of time to figure out if they've just skipped an order or if they've attrited. But we actually saw the opposite. I called out in the prepared remarks that we are estimating a $4 million of end-customer stocking.  And to break that down, we have really good insight into our direct business, which makes up about \u2013 still makes up almost half of our business. So, we know exactly when a customer asks for an order earlier than it would typically be shipped. And so, we estimated about $4 million worth of customers pulled the orders from Q2 into Q1.  And just to clarify for guidance for Q2, we are not assuming any impact in Q2. We are assuming Q2 has the same pull-ahead from Q3. And we expect that we'll see the other end of that headwind in the second half when it normalizes out. So, we kind of saw the opposite, Danielle, where we saw some strength in March, because of customers ordering. We are assuming we are going to see that again here in the second quarter.  As far as attrition goes, I think it's probably a little too early for recessionary impacts to start pushing on metrics like attrition in the first month here of April. So that one is still a TBD and we'll monitor that one very closely. As far as the financial systems program, we are not quantifying it right now, because we don't know exactly how many people are going to take advantage of that program and how utilized it will be. As Shacey mentioned, it's just really important for us and right in line with our mission to make sure that if there was someone who in the U.S. has lost their job and lost their insurance and whether they are in the process of getting coverage through Medicaid or another means to insurance, we wanted to be there to backstop them.  And so, we can't quantify that one at this time. I prioritized it in our list of gross margin headwinds at the end, because I think it'll be one of the smaller headwinds. But we'll \u2013 that one is yet to be determined.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. Great. I\u2019ll just leave it there. Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic : Thanks, Danielle.\nWayde McMillan : Thanks, Danielle.\nShacey Petrovic : And then, we'll just take one last question please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nShacey Petrovic : We can leave it there then.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. If there is no one on that, thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, operator. So, thank you. Despite volatile market conditions, we delivered strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter. The team adapted quickly to challenges and executed on behalf of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the situation and keep you all updated to the best that we can during this unprecedented times. And I just want to close by thanking our global Insulet team across three continents for their relentless hard work and dedication. It's because of you, that our team remains safe and healthy, that our customers know they can rely on us, even in the face of this pandemic to get the product and support that they need. So thank you all for joining us today. And our heartfelt thoughts and wishes go out to all of you and your families to stay safe and stay healthy. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Shacey. These are challenging times as we deal with the ongoing global health crisis, and I'd like to also say, thank you to the Insulet team, who has shown incredible adaptability, as we have all adjusted to a new mode of operating. And well wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19.  We are certainly not immune to the headwinds created by the pandemic. However, as Shacey stated, we are fortunate to have a durable annuity model with the vast majority of revenue generated in any given quarter coming from our existing customer base.  The current global environment is disrupted, but it does not change the significant market opportunity we have and we remain well positioned for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are confident in our ability to continue creating significant value for our shareholders while advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We achieved another strong quarter of financial and operating performance in Q1. The execution of our strategic imperatives is paying off and we continue to invest for growth. As a reminder, the revenue growth rates I will discuss on this call are on a constant currency basis.  In the first quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 25.3%, approximately $7 million above our quarterly guidance range. This strong growth was driven by our global diabetes business, which grew 34% and was $10.5 million above our guidance range.  We were able to achieve these results as our global operations and commercial teams did a tremendous job quickly adjusting to the constraints caused by COVID-19.  The operations team put measures in place early in the quarter, as we learned of challenges ramping back up our China manufacturing facility in January and the commercial team acted quickly later in March as regional lockdowns were implemented to switch to more telehealth activity.  As a result, we've been able to deliver product to customers without interruption and we are producing above historic levels with volume contribution from our new U.S. manufacturing plant, all while keeping a keen focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and delivering products to our customers. By product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 35.4%, $5.6 million above our guidance range and represented the highest growth rate we have achieved in our first quarter in over five years.  Our increasing customer base and growing adoption of Omnipod DASH, primarily through the pharmacy channel, continue to be the main drivers of outperformance, along with a mix benefit for the premium on Omnipod DASH.  In the quarter, we experienced an easing of the seasonal impact of Q1 deductible resets given our shift to the pharmacy and we also benefited from an estimated $4 million of end-customer stocking due to COVID-19. As a reminder, we began generating revenue for DASH at the start of the second quarter of last year. So our 2020 first half growth rate will benefit from annualizing the first full year of Omnipod DASH and our move into the pharmacy. In the first quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH drove over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts and we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to almost 30% of our total.  International Omnipod revenue grew 31.9%, $5 million above our guidance range. International also benefited from an estimated $2 million of channel stocking orders due to COVID-19 late in the quarter.  Drug Delivery revenue declined 50% and was below our guidance range. This was due to a shift in timing of production, which you will see is reflected in the greater-than-normal revenue growth we expect from this product line in the second quarter.  Overall, we are pleased with our strong revenue growth in the first quarter and start to the year, despite beginning to see a slowdown in new Omnipod customers in March. Turning to gross margin, we delivered 64.1% in the quarter, down 280 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially, including a 160 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-19-related costs, as well as a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from FX.  Also impacting gross margin was the continued impact of ramping production at our new U.S. manufacturing facility, with our second manufacturing line starting production in early March.  Partially offsetting the gross margin headwinds were the continued improvements through our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We were well prepared for this difficult situation given our complete supply chain redundancy strategies implemented over the last several years. The incremental 2020 costs we are incurring to maintain the safety of employees and the quality of our products and to ensure we produce ahead of demand is critically important during this time. We are pleased to be producing sellable product on our second U.S. manufacturing line and as we've previously communicated, it means we will incur a headwind to gross margin as we ramp. With the recent shift in focus to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts, we are now assuming a slower ramp of our manufacturing lines. Once fully operational, our U.S. manufacturing facility and lower landed cost of goods will drive gross margin expansion over the long-term.  Operating expenses in the first quarter were 60% of revenue, compared to 62% in the prior year, in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 12.3%. Regarding our cash and liquidity status, we are in a favorable cash position with no debt maturing until 2024 at the earliest and very low cash interest expense. At the end of the first quarter, we had $382 million in cash and investments, compared to $435 million at the end of last year.  This sequential decrease was primarily driven by our use of cash in order to invest for growth, including planned capital expenditures for our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a result of the recent refinancing of our convertible debt, we have a favorable debt profile with no near-term maturities and no restrictive covenants.  In summary, we have the cash position and favorable financing structure we need to profitably grow our business. Turning to our 2020 guidance. We are in an unprecedented time with the dynamic COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties it is creating. As we communicated in our earnings release, and as Shacey stated, we are maintaining our revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range.  We have the benefit of the durability of our recurring revenue model, which provides the vast majority of our revenue from our existing customer base. Historically, new Omnipod starts within any given quarter contributed approximately 10% of revenue. It is difficult to accurately predict the progression of COVID-19 and the extent of the resulting depth or length of the disruption.  However, we want to provide you with the key metrics for our business and underlying assumptions as we track them during this time. We have developed a set of assumptions, based on what we have experienced through April and what we understand about the macro environment. If our base assumptions are either too high or too low, we are well prepared to manage through the multiple scenarios.  As noted, we are assuming that the most significant impact will be on new global Omnipod starts in the second quarter with gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, assuming economies around the globe begin to reopen. As a result of a reduction in new Omnipod starts in Q2 and an assumed continued headwind in the second half of the year, we expect a compounding effect on revenue growth to mostly impact the second half of the year.  As compared to our previous expectations at the start of the year, we are now assuming quarterly reductions in our global new Omnipod starts of approximately 50% to 75% in the second quarter, approximately 50% in the third quarter and approximately 25% in the fourth quarter.  We are also assuming some downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for expected recessionary headwinds. Given our no-charge PDMs and pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy, we feel we are well positioned in the \u2013 if the market becomes more cost-sensitive.  This allows patients to adopt pod therapy for their diabetes management without the large upfront cost or the challenge of a four year lock-in period. We have also established a set of leading indicators and are monitoring our data more frequently to adjust to different scenarios as they play out in this challenging time. For our total company 2020 revenue guidance, we now expect approximately 15% growth, which is at the low end of the range we've previously provided. By product-line, we have slightly adjusted guidance. We now expect total Omnipod revenue growth of approximately 18%, at the low end of our prior guide.  For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 19%, near the low end of our prior guidance and for international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 16%, which is below our prior guidance.  Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect to land in the middle of the range we previously provided of a 15% to 20% decline based on our partners' current forecasts. Now turning to the rest of the P&L on a full year basis, for gross margin, we now expect the full year to be approximately 63%, compared to our prior expectation of approximately 65%. This factors in our forecasted reduction in volumes and related lower revenue forecast due to COVID-19, as well as an estimated $5 million to $10 million of additional one-time costs related to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts.  Also factored into our gross margin estimate is a slower ramp in our new U.S. manufacturing lines, as timing has been impacted by the shift in focus for the operations team to mitigate the risks related to pandemic safety, as well as supply chain continuity. And, to a lesser extent, the assumed cost of our enhanced financial assistance program. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with prior year. We will continue to invest in our innovation pipeline, expand our global commercial initiatives and invest in U.S. manufacturing. Lastly, we are reaffirming our expectation of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low end of the range. For 2021, as Shacey stated earlier, if our base assumptions hold for 2020 and we see market conditions stabilize in 2021, we will remain on track to deliver our revenue target of $1 billion.  For our 2021 gross margin target, as a result of the pandemic impact to volume and U.S. manufacturing ramp, we now expect a range of 67% to 70%. We still see a pathway to our original 70% target.  However, there are many scenarios that can play out. So we feel it's prudent to provide a wider range at this time. In no way does it change our confidence that we will achieve 70% gross margin over time.  Finally, we are reaffirming our expectation of 2021 operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low-end of the range. In summary, we started the year with higher-than-expected performance in Q1 and with our resilient business fundamentals and base assumptions, we believe Insulet is well positioned to sustain growth in 2020 and over the long-term. We remain focused on our strategic imperatives in delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. In closing, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted at this time. We are proud of our Insulet employees that have responded to this challenging situation and how they remain focused on our mission. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Hi, Robbie, it's Wayde. I can take that one. And the team saw this risk several years ago when they laid out the multi-year strategy and obviously made a significant investment. I know you've seen it here as well.  And to your point, that's giving a lot of tailwinds to the team here during this current challenge that we've got two lines up and running now and producing and that's allowing us to actually build inventory through this time and so being able to stay ahead of demand and demand that's overachieving or outperforming our base scenarios. Regarding the risk in China, I mean, we've got a really strong partner in China. I think we are very impressed by how quickly they took on the challenge and we are able to staff, recruit, onboard, train and safely move people into the facility and get our production up. It was clearly delayed from a typical year-end start.  But, given the environment, we were impressed by how quickly both the third-party team and our operations teams work together. I highlighted here some of the costs. We've put some incentives in place to help fund some of the work that our third-party manufacturer was doing and some of the extent they were going to get employees into the facility to get producing for us again after the New Year.  So, I think we're going to see a multi-facility strategy from us going forward. And one of the main drivers for our U.S. manufacturing facility was to get redundancy and we'll have redundancy once we have three and four lines running here in the U.S. and keeping our China manufacturing facilities. So we'll achieve that objective once we get our third line up and then eventually onto our fourth line. Next question, please? So, good afternoon, Dave. Yes, so \u2013 and thanks for bringing this one up, because we are hoping that we'd get an opportunity to give a little bit more context on it. Starting with the matching of our assumptions with the global economy and what we are starting to see in the macro environment with different countries and regions opening up. That's why we tied our base assumptions to this gradual improvement through the end of the year.  And clearly, we are expecting headwinds through the rest of the year. If it happens that regions open quicker and our customers and patients can get to meet with their physicians and get the therapies that they need to treat their disease sooner. We'll be ahead of those assumptions. But at this point, we're assuming that we'll continue to see these headwinds through the end of the year. And to the second part of your question, how does that compare or contrast to what we've seen in April? I'll use this as an opportunity just to help explain to people the impact of our model and it really shows the durability of our model, because the impact to Q2 is not really impacted that much by new patient starts.  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, approximately 10% of any quarter is due to new patient starts. And so, we're really benefiting from the strong second half of 2019 and strong performance into Q1. And what we've seen so far in April is, revenue continuing to perform well because we're benefiting from that momentum coming into Q2.  But behind that, we are seeing a slowdown in our new patient starts. And we really see that in two stages. We track our sales cycle in two main stages, sales leads and then actual new patient starts. So even in front of new patient starts, we are tracking our sales leads and that's where we saw a pretty acute drop-off in March.  And so, as that funnel coming into Q2 starts to get smaller, that's where we are seeing the impact and so that's going to impact May and June for the most part. So we are anticipating our new patient starts, although strong through April, will start to slow down here through May and June.  And then, it's our expectation that both given the ability for people to return to their endocrinologists and work on different strategies to improve their therapy, including pod therapy, we are assuming we'll gradually improve through the end of the year. And then, as Shacey highlighted, telehealth, we feel we are very well positioned.  Our teams were already working on telehealth initiatives, and we were training people virtually. But we have redoubled those efforts now in the face of this pandemic and we are doing, as Shacey said, thousands more and that's growing every day. Hey, Ryan, it's Wayde. And just to add on there to round off your question. As Shacey said, our installed base in the pharmacy is at 30%. We didn't give exact pharmacy new patient starts. But DASH, we did and DASH is 60% of our new patient starts, almost all of those were through the pharmacy as well as type 2 has grown to be a third of our new patient starts and the majority of those are through the pharmacy as well.  So, DASH and type 2 are a big part of what's driving the volume growth now to the 30% going through the pharmacy. Great. Hey, Matt. I can \u2013 this is Wayde. I can answer the first part of the question and then hand it to Shacey for the second part. So, we have not seen a material change as type 2s have become a bigger part of our mix of products. Our utilization has stayed pretty steady through Q1 and also through the first month of April.  And in fact, one of the things that was on our radar when we set our annual guidance at the beginning of the year and one of the things that we thought could have pushed us to the lower end of our original guide was attrition, because, we had done a lot of new things, a new channel, a new product, a new business model with the pay-as-you-go model.  And so, we left ourselves some room in the original guide that we could see attrition tick up. And what we experienced in Q1 is actually our attrition ticked down a little bit. We performed very well in the first quarter with slightly better attrition than we had seen historically. So we're very happy about that.  As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, though, as we head into this more recessionary-driven environment, we are adding a tick-up in attrition and a tick-down in utilization, just because we don't know what the recessionary environment holds for us and we are going to start there and put that stake in the ground and then we'll monitor it as we go from here. Yes. Hi, Travis. Thank you. So to the first part of the question on new patient starts, it is versus our guide and our previous expectations for 2020. And of course, those are estimates, right? We have really good visibility into Q2, as I mentioned, walking through the two-stage sales cycle there.  And really good visibility for Q2, obviously, in this environment, there is going to be more uncertainty for the second half and what that holds. But we thought it was important to just lay out these key metrics and put a stake in the ground, so that we can then help you understand the key drivers for our business here and then we can message to it as we go throughout the year. As far as the full year guide goes, the key is new patient starts. We think that, that will be the most significant metric to watch for. If we just pull up and think about our business model, we have this advantage of a durable recurring revenue model. And so even when we see new patients get impacted like we did in March and the inability for our customers to get to the ENDO office, I mean, it's a really unique dynamic and with that, the momentum of our business carries.  And so we've got really strong growth rates in Q1. We're putting a strong guide in for Q2 and what we have to manage then is this compounding of new patient starts. So if we go through two or three quarters of restrained new patient starts, that's going to weigh on our growth rate, especially given the tough comps we had, because we performed so well at the end of last year. So when we annualize into that tough comp, we are going to have to manage through some lower growth rates in the second half.  But then, as expected, when we see our new patient starts start to build momentum through the end of the year again and then assuming when we get back to normal or a new normal, which is, as Shacey talked about earlier, may involve more telehealth, but we get back to a more new \u2013 a new normal where we're getting a regular cadence of new patient starts, then the momentum builds again and we start to drive our growth rates even higher.  So, we felt it was important to really lay out that new patient start dynamic. And then the other key metrics that I mentioned, utilization and attrition. We have ticked down utilization a little bit, attrition up a little bit. But the major driver here is new patient starts. So for that, we are going to watch it.  We are going to certainly benefit from the durability of this model here in the first half of the year. We are going to track these key metrics through the second half and then hopefully, we'll all move beyond this pandemic and get back to business here in 2021. Okay. Operator, we are over time. But why don't we try to get through at least one, maybe two more, please? Next question, please? Sure. Sounds good. So we typically see a few weeks to a month lag between our sales leads, and then leading into our new patient starts. And so, as I mentioned, we saw the decline in sales leads really hit in March.  But our teams have done \u2013 this is in direct reference to Shacey's prepared remark, where she talked about the ability for the team to transition to working remotely and working through telehealth and we've done a great job through the end of March and into April transitioning what was in the pipeline into new patient starts.  And so, when we guide to a reduction in new patient starts of 50% to 75% for Q2, it is a result of looking at that sales lead pipeline, what happened to it in March, what we've seen happen to it in April and what we are calculating will be the impact in May and June. So that's the way the math works on that one. So from a training perspective, that you mentioned, Kyle is, our teams are doing a great job. As Shacey said, we are into the thousands in the first few weeks and ramping every day. And that's both U.S. and OUS.  The IT teams have worked with the marketing teams to rapidly learn what are the bottlenecks \u2013 worked with the HCPs to find out what are the bottlenecks and these teams every day are clearing hurdles, and we are getting more efficient at being able to train people virtually. Next question, please? Sure. So I can start, if you like, Shacey. And I just mentioned to a previous question there that through Q1, actually attrition was a little better than we've had historically. And so, in the face of the pay-as-you-go model where we thought we could see some higher attrition. We actually saw lower attrition.  As we get more acute into the month of March, it becomes harder to know if someone's actually attrited. It takes a bit of time to figure out if they've just skipped an order or if they've attrited. But we actually saw the opposite. I called out in the prepared remarks that we are estimating a $4 million of end-customer stocking.  And to break that down, we have really good insight into our direct business, which makes up about \u2013 still makes up almost half of our business. So, we know exactly when a customer asks for an order earlier than it would typically be shipped. And so, we estimated about $4 million worth of customers pulled the orders from Q2 into Q1.  And just to clarify for guidance for Q2, we are not assuming any impact in Q2. We are assuming Q2 has the same pull-ahead from Q3. And we expect that we'll see the other end of that headwind in the second half when it normalizes out. So, we kind of saw the opposite, Danielle, where we saw some strength in March, because of customers ordering. We are assuming we are going to see that again here in the second quarter.  As far as attrition goes, I think it's probably a little too early for recessionary impacts to start pushing on metrics like attrition in the first month here of April. So that one is still a TBD and we'll monitor that one very closely. As far as the financial systems program, we are not quantifying it right now, because we don't know exactly how many people are going to take advantage of that program and how utilized it will be. As Shacey mentioned, it's just really important for us and right in line with our mission to make sure that if there was someone who in the U.S. has lost their job and lost their insurance and whether they are in the process of getting coverage through Medicaid or another means to insurance, we wanted to be there to backstop them.  And so, we can't quantify that one at this time. I prioritized it in our list of gross margin headwinds at the end, because I think it'll be one of the smaller headwinds. But we'll \u2013 that one is yet to be determined. Thanks, Danielle. Yes. If there is no one on that, thanks."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last few months have posed extraordinary challenges for countries and communities around the world as we've grappled with the impact of COVID-19. Our hearts go out to those whose health has been affected and our gratitude goes out to the many medical professionals and first responders on the front-lines. We also hope that all of you joining us on today's call are staying safe and healthy. As a company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes, the safety and well-being of our Insulet employees and the communities and Podders we serve, have been our top priorities as we navigate these difficult circumstances. In March, we transitioned to remote work arrangements for the vast majority of employees, in line with guidance issued by the WHO, CDC, local governments and health authorities. For those employees performing critical on-site functions, we significantly enhanced safety procedures to include social distancing, PPE protocols, frequent deep cleaning of our facilities and temperature monitoring. I am pleased to report that this transition has been essentially seamless and on behalf of our leadership team, I'd like to express our sincere gratitude to the employees who are continuing to work on-site to ensure we can provide uninterrupted supply of Omnipod to our customers. I am incredibly proud of our global teams' resilience and compassion in the face of this challenge.  While balancing many other demands like working from home, caring for children and keeping their families and friends healthy, our dedicated employees have never lost focus on our mission. Our Insulet team is what makes us such a great company and I want to thank each and every one of our employees across the globe.  I'd also like to thank our many supply chain partners for supporting our ability to build excess capacity and redundancy to ensure we can serve our customers without interruption and without delay. Notwithstanding the difficult external environment that began to affect our international business in February and U.S. market in March, we achieved first quarter revenue of almost $200 million, representing a 25% increase, driven by 34% revenue growth in our total diabetes product line.  This performance is a testament to both our execution and the strength of our recurring revenue business model. We were well positioned coming into the crisis having ended 2019 in a position of strength with healthy inventory levels, a strong balance sheet, robust global manufacturing operations and plans to capitalize on our growth prospects. We started 2020 with global Omnipod revenue near all-time highs and in the first quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. In the face of new obstacles, we've responded quickly and effectively, maintaining our focus on execution and we delivered financial results exceeding our expectations. While the impacts of COVID are difficult to predict, after a careful consideration and scenario planning, we have decided to maintain our annual guidance, although, we expect to come in at the low-end of the range we previously provided. Our unique business model is a key differentiator, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base.  Therefore, while the current environment is unusually challenging, we believe our 2019 and Q1 2020 momentum will provide insulation. This gives us confidence that even in the face of this [Indiscernible] revenue at the mid-teens rate in 2020.  Wayde will provide more detail. But assuming market dynamics normalize early next year, we also believe we can maintain our $1 billion revenue goal for 2021. Importantly, our relative strength in the near-term allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives that will drive growth over the longer-term. These investments will ensure that over the coming years, Insulet makes significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We will bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market.  Our business model innovation will ensure cost-effective access to the broadest population of users across the globe and our investment in operational excellence will ensure supply chain resiliency, world-class manufacturing capabilities, and industry-leading gross margins. There is much work to be done to realize our vision and in 2020, we will continue to make significant progress. This year, we are focused on driving four key initiatives forward. One, deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization.  Our team has done a remarkable job quickly adjusting in the face of COVID-19 and despite the challenges of working remotely, we do not expect an impact of more than a couple of quarters on our execution timelines. Engineers are finding creative ways to innovate in their newly virtual teams, sales calls are happening via Webex and our manufacturing and supply teams are ensuring we meet our growing customer demand without missing a beat. I'll now walk through our Q1 progress on each of these key initiatives, starting with delivering a consumer-focused innovation. During the first quarter, we continued to grow the number of Omnipod DASH users, driven by both the intuitive simplicity of its platform and our unique pay-as-you-go business model through the pharmacy channel.  By eliminating complexity and restrictions, we are making Omnipod more accessible to a broader range of customers. Omnipod is differentiated, particularly in a down economy because it has no upfront cost.  This is also helpful to Insulet, creating a high degree of insulation through our recurring revenue durable annuity model. In this first quarter, we continued to increase coverage for Omnipod DASH, which helped grow the number of customers accessing Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy. As of the end of Q1, we had secured Omnipod coverage in the United States for over 50% of Medicare and approximately 70% of Medicaid beneficiaries. And we've seen a notable tick-up in commercial coverage for DASH, with DASH now covered for over 60% of commercially insured lives.  In the first quarter, approximately one-third of our U.S. new Omnipod starts were Type 2, primarily Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy channel. As a result of this strong growth and expanding market access, our U.S. new Omnipod starts represented another record Q1. With last year's launch of Omnipod DASH, we created our online training program for DASH customers transitioning from Omnipod. This enables users to get started via online training without the need to leave home or meet with a clinician for support. Thanks to DASH's simplicity. This web-based training has been a success and today, it is being used extensively to support thousands of users.  And in fact, many users transitioning from Omnipod to DASH just rely on the intuitive user interface, which provides step-by-step instructions to get started. These tools were created to support effective scaling of our business and have proven to be exceptionally helpful in our current environment. In addition, in response to the pandemic, our team worked quickly to expand and enhance our program to include virtual training for new users that still want support from a clinician. The virtual training and support capabilities we have built across our global business have allowed us to successfully service existing customers and to onboard new customers, even those that are brand-new to pump therapy. In fact, over the last several weeks in our direct markets, which represent about half of our business, we have on-boarded approximately 2,000 new users via virtual training with Insulet clinical trainers. And about 80% of these were MDI users new to pump and pod therapy. We have also seen our distributors and intermediaries implement great virtual training programs.  Last week, I personally observed one of these trainings via Webex and it was a remarkable experience. Our Clinical Training Manager walked a Podder, 7-year-old Colton and his parents through the setup and pod activation of Omnipod DASH. They were transitioning from multiple daily injections.  The training was thorough, effective, and the family was clearly at ease receiving it in the comfort of their own home and it was absolutely wonderful to see the delight on Colton's and his mom's faces when they learned about DASH's food library and temp basal capabilities, and when they experienced putting on their very first pod. It was a clear reminder of just how simple and accessible Omnipod is. We have made great strides in delivering a best-in-class customer experience. We are constantly making it easier for users to try Omnipod and access it from a convenient pharmacy. We had much of this work underway in order to support our rapid growth and our goal to deliver the best global customer experience.  Telemedicine, virtual training tools and the convenience of pharmacy access will continue to deliver appealing, scalable customer experiences.  While we remain encouraged by the momentum of Omnipod DASH, we have seen a slowdown of new Omnipod starts globally. This intensified in March, as many people delayed non emergency doctor visits due to COVID-19 and we expect to face the strongest new start headwinds in the second quarter.  It is obviously difficult to predict the timing and extent to which COVID will impact our business. We don't know how long our customers will be challenged meeting with their physicians or precisely how much our telehealth capabilities will offset this impact.  Our guidance assumes the pandemic's recessionary headwinds will persist throughout 2020, followed by a gradual recovery starting in the third quarter, as economies begin to reopen and physician and patient interactions begin to normalize. We are presently assuming market dynamics return to normal starting in 2021. In addition to ensuring the safety of our employees and continuity of supply to our Podders, our team has found ways to give back to our communities. We have participated in PPE donation programs to local healthcare facilities and gifted computer equipment to support remote schooling needs in our communities.  And I am particularly proud that in response to the significant economic impact of COVID-19, we have broadened our financial assistance program to ensure those who rely on Omnipod can remain on product if they lose insurance coverage.  This is a robust program designed to help address the unique healthcare affordability challenges for U.S. Omnipod users, who lose coverage due to COVID-19 and are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid. For these users, we will provide up to six months of pods at zero cost through the end of 2020. Throughout the first quarter, we continued our work to develop our next-generation product, Omnipod powered by Horizon. We remain highly confident that Omnipod Horizon, the first tubeless, personal, smartphone-controlled automated insulin delivery system will be a game changer for people living with diabetes.  As you know, we paused the Horizon trial at the beginning of March in order to address a software anomaly. I am pleased to report that we have successfully completed the software update and has been sent to the FDA for review. Given anticipated agency review times and newly required logistics at our trial sites, we are now tracking to bring Omnipod Horizon to the U.S. market in the first half of 2021.  We are fortunate to benefit from the enthusiastic support of our trial sites and participants and expect that all sites and virtually all patients will continue in the trial. That said, COVID-19 presents some challenges to how we support and monitor the trial and this likely will add a few months to our timelines. The team has reacted quickly, proposing updated protocols to the FDA to ensure virtual follow-up and support and our interactions with the agency continue to be collaborative and helpful.  We look forward to resuming the trial and we know our study participants are eagerly awaiting the benefits of simple, automated insulin delivery provided by Omnipod Horizon. In addition to our progress with Omnipod Horizon, the team has continued to advance our collaborations with Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool. Over the coming years, these partnerships will bring exciting new products to market that will deliver reduced burden and improved outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We also continued to advance our existing platforms to bring even more value to our customers. This year, we will build-out Omnipod DASH with various new languages to further expand globally and we will deliver DASH with remote upgrade capabilities, including secure cloud-to-cloud integration through Glooko, enabling additional ease of use and telemedicine capabilities. And development work is underway on mobile phone platform extensions for Omnipod Horizon such as iOS. Now, turning to our global expansion. As a result of the progress we made capitalizing on our direct operations in Europe, we have strengthened our presence in many of our large underserved existing markets.  We entered into a limited commercial release of Omnipod DASH in three European markets at the end of 2019 and had planned to further roll out DASH in Europe and Canada and to enter five new international markets.  We are eager to expand into new geographies and DASH has been well received in the markets in which we've launched it. COVID-19, however, presents some uncertainty in terms of market readiness, training and preparedness of our teams and partners, as well as regulatory and market clearances.  We believe these dynamics delay our DASH and market expansion efforts into early 2021, as we work to ensure the markets are prepared for successful DASH launches and market expansions. These impacts are temporary and we continue to view global expansion as an exciting multiyear growth driver for Insulet. Lastly, I will address our manufacturing innovation and ongoing efforts to drive global operational excellence. Several years ago, we began taking steps to strengthen our global supply chain. We focused on building redundancy with our U.S. manufacturing capabilities to supplement our capacity in China, as well as create redundancy throughout our entire global supply chain.  The importance of this effort was highlighted as we worked to maintain production continuity in the face of COVID-19, first in China, and then in the United States. I am very proud of the incredible work our team has done to ensure we are producing above planned product levels, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our global employees. We are laser-focused on making sure our customers receive continued uninterrupted access to Omnipod. This pandemic is the challenge of our lifetimes, but we will emerge stronger and better for it. Already at Insulet, it is driving us to improve systems, enhance telemedicine capabilities and further strengthen our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Insulet is rising to this incredible challenge and there is no other team I would rather work with and rely on to see us through to the other side.  We remain focused on executing our strategy to continue creating value for shareholders. And we remain focused on our mission to improve the lives of people living with diabetes even in the most difficult of times. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, I think you are right. Your data supports what we see, which is that we are \u2013 there are all sorts of things that make Omnipod a really appealing insulin delivery therapy for patients. And some of those things are even more powerful in an environment like the one we are in.  When you think about the move towards a more cost-conscious consumer in this really challenging economic environment, obviously, the fact that you don't have to pay upfront for Omnipod and you are not locked in to four years of therapy, those things are very appealing. But I think probably even more powerful than that is the simplicity of the platform.  And in some ways, telehealth just plays really perfectly into our strategy, because our whole goal is to bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market and if you think about what you need to be able to transition people in a telehealth environment, from multiple daily injections to a new technology, it's got to be simple.  And we've developed a technology that is simple enough for kids, simple enough for multiple daily injection users and one that really, if you think about it, has two components, no needles to handle, no infusion sets. So it's just a very simple technology to train on. And I think that differentiator is going to become more powerful in the environment that we are in today.  So, we feel good about this trend and I personally am really excited by the capabilities that we've built and expanded on in a really short period of time to be able to lean in during this time and really bring our technology to more people who need it. Thanks, David. Yes, you are right, on ex U.S., just the way that care is delivered there, obviously, many more people living with diabetes get trained on new technologies like Omnipod in the hospital setting, as opposed to the clinic setting.  And so, we do anticipate it'll take a little bit longer for some of those markets to return towards normalcy and the headwinds are a little bit more significant. That said, we do have telehealth activities going on and virtual trainings going on in every international market, just like we do in every U.S. territory. And so, I think that's just the nature of what we are dealing with in the U.S. In terms of visibility, we have \u2013 we benefit in the U.S. from visibility to our direct customers and that helps give us a sense of what we can extrapolate across the markets. The same thing is true in Europe, although I think the insights into our direct patients aren't as easily extrapolated into additional markets.  So that's the challenge we have, is just how fragmented the European market is. But we work every day obviously with our partners and with our team to get those insights and as Wayde said, to be tracking those leading indicators, so that we can manage the business as effectively as we can during this time. Next question? Yes. I think it's a good question, Joanne. It's difficult obviously to predict the future. What our data shows is, and I'll speak mainly to the U.S., because that's where we have really the best insight. But what our data demonstrates is that, in the United States, endocrinologist visits are down 60% since the beginning of March.  And of that remaining 40% that are still happening, 15% of those are being delivered via telemedicine. So a pretty significant drop-off. What we see is just a more and more adoption of telemedicine across the United States. So I think that'll help offset it. And I think one of our questions is, how durable is telemedicine, because it's obviously dependent in some ways on reimbursement.  But we do track state-by-state new patient starts and as Wayde said, our leads in those markets to see in some of these areas that were hit harder than others, are they starting to recuperate? And so we see indications of that across various markets and that's what we'll continue to track so that we can continue to forecast. Thanks, Joanne. I don't think this impact today makes us feel differently about the new markets that we had planned to enter. Really, what's \u2013 what we are planning for is just to make sure that we have all of these markets prepared for successful launches. And so, in various markets, we might be, for example partnering with a strong distributor partner there.  We may be seeking market clearances or even regulatory approvals and we want to make sure that all of that stuff is in place before we launch into the market. And so that's really where we are \u2013 when we're thinking about different timelines and potentially early 2021 instead of 2020, it's really tied to making sure that we have everything prepared so that we can have successful launches.  Not that we are thinking about different territories at this point. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity, as I always say. We are really in a handful of countries relative to the rest of the world, and that's true even in Europe where we are starting to build a really strong presence there. There is still a tremendous amount of unmet need.  So we are going to attack that unmet need. It's just going to be a little bit later than we expected because of these dynamics. Sure. Yes. I think we're seeing a lot of advantages, frankly and not any disadvantages in terms of virtual training. I mean, I think there are always going to be some subset of patients who would prefer in a perfect world to be trained with a clinician or in a clinic.  But the feedback from patients on virtual training has been incredibly positive. People are describing it as simple. I can tell you from the one that I witnessed just on Friday that the patients were incredibly comfortable. The family was incredibly comfortable that we were able to get more insight into kind of how they operate by just seeing them at home.  And it was a very efficient, very effective training, so. and the feedback has been very positive. So I think this is a trend that will continue regardless of what happens with telemedicine. We are seeing a lot of positive feedback out of this. Our clinicians can be more efficient. Patients don't have to get into the clinic and the feedback has been very positive.  It's just so simple. You don't have a needle. You don't have \u2013 you have two components, and it's a really straightforward technology to walk a user through. So, it is ideally suited to virtual training. Yes. Thanks, Margaret. I \u2013 first, I'll say that it's pretty remarkable to me that actually virtual sales calls are still happening with endocrinology offices and in many cases, ENDOs are really looking for information from us in terms of how we can support telehealth activities. I think earlier in February, we had a webinar focused on telemedicine with Omnipod and like 800 physicians attended that.  So there is a tremendous demand out there for this information and insight to how do you do this well, and we've got great resources to be able to support those discussions with ENDOs. So that isn't going away. But to your point, obviously, that's where the headwinds are coming from.  We have reallocated resources from a sales and marketing perspective, from things like conferences and travel and entertainment to a more digital outreach, direct-to-patients, to be able to engage them on: one, the benefits of Omnipod, and two, the fact that you can try it, risk-free and you can train all at home without needing to go into the clinic. And so it's early days, but we believe that message will resonate with patients. Thanks, Ryan. So we are anticipating just a little bit of time, a few weeks of FDA review for the submission to restart the trial. And then, we've got to retrain sites, et cetera on just the virtual protocols for follow-up and monitoring of patients. And so, we think that's going to take a little bit of time, probably sometime into June, I would guess, before we restart the trial. And in terms of a limited market release, we will do a limited market release. It's best practice with any new technology to do a limited market release. We will do what we can to bring this technology as rapidly and through access and other methods to patients as quickly as possible because, we know there is a significant demand out there. But it is going to take us a little bit of time to get through the limited market release. I'll take maybe the pharmacy issues and then Wayde can talk about what percentage of our new starts. I am not sure if we gave that detail. But in terms of the overall base, we now have almost 30% of our U.S. customers going through the pharmacy.  And actually, when I think about how do we really scale this business, we've always been thinking about how do we help our customers get the best customer experience through self-service, through easier training, et cetera. And we've talked a lot about that. Our virtual training tools and our web-based training tools.  But the pharmacy is a big piece of this, too. This work was underway for us, because diabetes is an epidemic and endocrinology is in short supply. And so we need to innovate the business model to be able to ensure that we can meet this rapidly growing demand in this unmet need. And so, of course, all of the telemedicine stuff that we talked about is a piece of that.  But the other piece of that, if patients need care and potentially aren't in their physicians' offices frequently, the pharmacy could play a really exciting and really important role, because unlike your endocrinology office, there is a pharmacy on every corner and if we could leverage that channel to educate, inform, and support patients, that could be a much better customer experience.  And of course, it's a channel that we, right now, from an insulin delivery standpoint or insulin pump standpoint, own. And so, very \u2013 we see it as a worthy investment in a way to provide the best possible experience and the most cost-effective scaling commercially of our business. It's great to see, too, just the progress we've made on establishing access through the pharmacy. It's a big piece of why we've been able to expand so much and in fact, just in the last month, we've even secured Cigna coverage in the pharmacy channel, which is \u2013 that's part of why we saw that tick-up in commercial coverage and part of what continues to drive adoption through the pharmacy channel. Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think I don't want to comment on kind of competitive pump businesses. But what we do know, just from IQVIA data and market \u2013 primary market research is that in the United States, ENDO visits are down 60% since the beginning of March. So I think that gives you a sense that this 50% to 75% number is probably right in line with what others are seeing.  And while we are, I would say, bullish on what kind of fit Omnipod is for telemedicine and we believe in that world we can lean in and do better than others. At the same time, we are relying on ENDOs to build telemedicine capabilities. So while we have kind of sped ahead and I think built some really exciting capabilities and support mechanisms for our ENDO offices, they are still across the globe.  Different clinics are in very different situations in terms of their capabilities to be able to support telemedicine. So, we're a little bit ahead of the curve, and we'll see how this plays out and how quickly ENDO offices across the globe, frankly, but particularly in the United States can start to implement and support telehealth for their patients. It's great, Wayde. And in terms of your second part of your question around reimbursement for the type 2 patients, one of the things we really like about the pharmacy channel is that there are \u2013 there isn't really a distinguishment between reimbursement for type 2 or type 1, if they require insulin. And so there are fewer restrictions.  It's a simpler channel to access your technology through and it really doesn't distinguish between type 1 or type 2, provided the patient is insulin-dependent and needs an insulin delivery mechanism. And then, of course, we always educate payers on the fact that Omnipod reduces total daily dose of insulin and provides very clear benefits for both patient segments.  And so, we've been fortunate to establish broad reimbursement through the pharmacy channel that doesn't distinguish between the two segments. And Travis, I'll just comment on your question regarding the patient assistance program. We don't look at that as hitting revenue, because these are patients who would not be able to afford the product anyways. And so I'm really, really proud of this program.  I am proud of the fact that Insulet was out front and that we can help support patients who otherwise might not be able to access the product. But we didn't view that as a revenue headwind, because those patients would have probably had traded off the product because they can't afford it. I think one of the challenges in the DME channel is the limitation of access for people living with type 2 diabetes. So that's one area where we likely will not see access or availability. And then, I am not sure about the others. We haven't really seen trends that would indicate that there is a particular challenge with the DME environment that isn't being experienced in the pharmacy channel with the exception of type 2 access. Great. I think Wayde can take the first part of your question and I'll address the second. And I think on your question tied to what have we learned about Horizon, I mean we continue to learn every day. But I'll tell you that the most exciting thing from my perspective about Horizon is that, it really has been designed from the outset to be the simplest technology on the market and so that will lend itself very, very well to a telehealth environment.  And the other great thing about Horizon, besides its simplicity, is that there is real-time access to cloud data. And so that will be \u2013 that should enable some really easy and effective interactions between patients and physicians, whether they are happening in the clinic or in particular, if they are happening via telemedicine. Thanks, Danielle. And then, we'll just take one last question please. We can leave it there then. Yes. Thanks, operator. So, thank you. Despite volatile market conditions, we delivered strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter. The team adapted quickly to challenges and executed on behalf of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the situation and keep you all updated to the best that we can during this unprecedented times. And I just want to close by thanking our global Insulet team across three continents for their relentless hard work and dedication. It's because of you, that our team remains safe and healthy, that our customers know they can rely on us, even in the face of this pandemic to get the product and support that they need. So thank you all for joining us today. And our heartfelt thoughts and wishes go out to all of you and your families to stay safe and stay healthy. Thanks."

These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. 02:04 Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. 02:18 With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: 02:21 Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results mark the end of another year of strong growth, successful execution across our strategic imperatives and advancement of our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. 02:40 In 2021, we increased awareness and adoption of Omnipod in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, continued to unlock access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, expanded internationally and strengthened our global manufacturing operations. That momentum has continued into 2022 with the recent FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which we could not be more excited about. 03:05 While 2021 was a strong year, it certainly wasn't without its challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, global supply chain shortages and growing AID competition, particularly in our international markets. It is wonderful to see the global diabetes community embrace automated insulin delivery technology, and it is a clear indicator of how well received we believe Omnipod 5 will be. We are making great progress with our commercial rollout in the U.S. and advancing our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 03:40 The consistent strategic progress we have made is reflected in our financial results. In 2021, we surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, in line with the goal we provided in 2016 as part of our long-range plan. 2021 also marked our sixth consecutive year of 20% or more revenue growth and we now serve approximately 300,000 global customers using Omnipod. 04:08 We are already off to a terrific start in 2022 with a critical milestone. The FDA clearance and commercial launch of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that offers full compatible smartphone control and an advanced algorithm residing on the Pod. It has taken incredible effort and commitment by the Insulet team to reach this ground breaking achievement. 04:35 Omnipod 5 marks the greatest and most complex innovation Insulet has brought to market in our company's 20-year history. It offers unmatched innovation with a patient preferred form factor and it strengthens the value we provide customers today through our pay-as-you-go business model and U.S. pharmacy access. These distinctive benefits should provide us with unique competitive advantages in the market and we'll deliver life-changing technology to our customers. 05:04 Taking a step back, diabetes is a growing epidemic and the global markets remain critically underserved with low pump utilization. However, people with diabetes are adopting wearable technology at an increasing rate as CGM use and awareness accelerates. Our efforts to improve access to and awareness of Omnipod along with our customer-centric approach to innovation are driving continued Omnipod adoption. 05:31 In the U.S., we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injection and we remain a leader in the Type 2 market based on our form factor, the simplicity of our technology, demonstrated outcomes and broad affordable access through the pharmacy. Type 2 continues to represent between 35% and 40% of our new customers in the U.S. These trends offer significant growth opportunities for Insulet over the long-term, given Omnipod differentiated benefits, as well as our relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience. We expect to continue to drive Omnipod penetration, expand our total addressable market and grow our global market share. 06:17 I will now provide an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Expanding access to and awareness of Omnipod is essential to our strategy. Today for more people than ever Omnipod is available through our pay-as-you-go model in the U.S. pharmacy channel. 06:43 The pharmacy provides easier access and lower costs for the majority of our customers. Payers and Omnipod users are not burdened with four-year lock-in period. New technologies like Omnipod 5 can be adopted without upgrade or upfront fees and supplies can be picked up conveniently from a nearby pharmacy. For the payer, this means we assumed the risk through our pay-as-you-go business model, and for the Omnipod user it means easier access and affordability. 07:14 The enhanced experience in the pharmacy is great and is exactly why we are investing to expand access here. The primary driver of our growth over the last two years has been Omnipod DASH, and we have successfully secured broad access to this innovation globally. Almost all of our new customers in 2021 started on Omnipod DASH, and in the U.S., we've now secured almost 90% of covered lives for this product primarily in the pharmacy. 07:42 Essential to access is affordability. The vast majority of our U.S. consumers pay less than $50 each month for Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy, and the average is far less with many customers paying nothing. While the cost to users of Omnipod DASH is on par with multiple daily injections, Omnipod provides improved outcomes and quality of life. We continue to look for ways to reduce cost and the logistical and administrative hurdles for all customers, so they can access and afford Omnipod. 08:17 Our efforts to raise awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns is also helping to drive adoption. Our programs across the U.S. and select international markets are ramping and continue to drive a positive response and contribute to our customer growth. In 2022, we planned to expand our DTC efforts to drive increased awareness of Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5. Given our success to date, we are excited to see the impact our DTC campaign will have once Omnipod 5 is fully launched. 08:48 Delivering the best customer experience is at the heart of what we do. For 15 years, we've been using our unique form factor to simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 takes our innovation to the next level. It is the world's first phone controlled Pod based AID system, and we are confident it will build on our history of improving diabetes management as we leapfrog all other AIG system on the market. 09:17 Full phone control is far beyond what others in the market have been working on. With full phone control, there is no separate controller and there is no traditional pump. The entire experience is on body and on phone. No tubes and no pulling out the pump to dismiss an alarm, change pump settings or prime an infusion set. Full phone control is the next level of simplicity and sophistication, and it is an experience that is only possible with a true wearable form factor like Omnipod. We've redefined the category of insulin delivery. 09:50 In addition to being the first tubeless fully smartphone controlled AID system, Omnipod 5 includes customizable set point our smart adjust algorithm on the pod and a novel bolus calculator. This level of innovation required unusually complex regulatory submission, including three 510(K)s, three lead reviewers at the agency and thousands of pages of data. Our limited market release has already begun and the early customers are over the moon. 10:24 Limited market releases are best practiced with launches of major new innovations and ours is designed to test our customer training and support system, build access and ensure the best possible customer experience upon full market release. In addition to product innovation, we have also transformed how users access Omnipod through the pharmacy. Customers can now enjoy a simple on-boarding process and a modernized customer service platform. 10:54 We can verify pharmacy benefits in seconds, streamline complex paperwork request, enable our field teams to manage their pipelines more efficiently and facilitate a 100% digital pathway to access our products. During 2021, our market access teams contracted strong coverage for Omnipod 5 prior to FDA clearance. And we are now able to move more swiftly to expand coverage further as many payors waited for clearance to established coverage policy. 11:26 We expect to be in limited release for three to nine months and are excited to rollout our system more broadly as the year progresses. We can't wait for everyone to experience the simplicity and improved outcomes enjoyed by our clinical study participants. Omnipod 5 is the most anticipated innovation within the diabetes community and our team is laser-focused on ensuring the system is available to everyone. 11:52 Shortly after clearance, we also delivered our FDA submission to expand Omnipod 5's indication down to age two. This is important as we know the tremendous benefits Omnipod 5 can provide this vulnerable population and their caregivers and we continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. We recently completed our Type 2 feasibility study and look forward to sharing results at the ATTV diabetes conference in April. 12:21 We will take the learnings from this study to design our pivotal study with the intent to deliver Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 diabetes. We have proven to be a pioneer in the Type 2 space and expect continued strong adoption given the benefits of Omnipod DASH, our U.S. pharmacy channel access and now Omnipod 5. Even as we launch Omnipod 5, we continue to strategically invest in a robust product pipeline. Omnipod 5 is a platform that you'll see us advance in the coming years. 12:52 Our iOS app development is making terrific progress as is our integration work with both DexCom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are focused in three areas. We are working on advancements that will grow our addressable market. We are developing next-generation AID technology, and we are creating digital innovations and data products to make diabetes management easier for our podders. 13:21 Over the last several years, we have built on and enriched our digital platform capabilities. With SIM cards in every Omnipod 5 controller and by better aggregating and analyzing user level data, we can further enhance the customer experience for all stakeholders. With these investments, we can improve outcomes, lessen the burden for both physicians and users by providing actionable insight and develop more advanced future product offering. These innovations will serve as another driver to secure Omnipod as the user preferred brand and strengthen our digital health capabilities. 13:59 We have a sharp focus on our growing intellectual property as we create innovative new technologies and build on our strong existing patent portfolio. In 2021, we filed more new patent applications than in any previous year. This will help ensure we are well positioned to deliver on our mission and provide differentiated and industry leading innovation to people with diabetes for decades to come. 14:24 This past year, we built upon our 2020 expansion efforts and the rollout of Omnipod DASH across our international markets through targeted geographic expansion. We entered the Asia Pacific region through our entry into Australia and also expanded into Turkey. These efforts broadened access to Omnipod and strengthened our foundation for future growth. We expect additional market expansion in 2022 in the Middle East. 14:52 Our efforts to deliver Omnipod 5 to our international markets are underway. We are making great progress and I'm happy to share that we submitted for CE marking in Europe. AID adoption is accelerating, and while it presenting near term headwind, increasing market acceptance, reimbursement pathways and awareness of these technologies bode well for Omnipod 5 once we launch in our international markets. We look forward to Omnipod 5 being the product of choice globally. 15:24 Many additional people around the world would benefit from Omnipod and we are focused on bringing it to them over time. We are building our international teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. Diabetes is underserved everywhere in the world and entering new markets represents a critical long-term growth driver for Insulet. 15:47 Investing in our manufacturing operations also remains a strategic priority as we build upon our established global capabilities and scale. We made great progress in 2021, including additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing operations and to secure uninterrupted access to critical component creating a more resilient supply chain during these unprecedented times. We can produce 10s of millions of Pods a year and are extremely well positioned despite the challenging supply chain environment. 16:20 Our team continues to execute remarkably well successfully mitigating the impact on our business and on our customers. These efforts will support the full commercial release of Omnipod 5. The continued strong global demand we expect for Omnipod DASH and our growing innovation pipeline. Our growth plans in 2022 and the years ahead will not be constrained by capacity. 16:47 In closing, we finished another strong year and are extremely excited about 2022. We expect to fully launch Omnipod 5 this year in the U.S. We are advancing our strategy to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and we have an exciting and robust innovation roadmap. Our success is due to our talented team and their unwavering commitment to our mission. We have built an amazing company and an award winning culture. 17:17 This past year, we were named a great place to work in both the U.S. and the UK, while also separately being recognized as one of the Best Workplaces for Women. This past December, Druker's Institute listed Insulet as one of the top managed companies of 2021 based on customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. These recognitions in part because they come directly from employee and customer feedback are wonderful reminders of the power of our people and our positive impact on one another in our communities and on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. 17:58 I'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: 18:01 Thank you, Shacey. Our fourth quarter performance closed out another year of progress for Insulet on many fronts. Our focused investments and consistent execution of our strategic imperatives continue to strengthen our financial profile while driving meaningful value for all of our stakeholders. 18:20 In the fourth quarter, we generated 26% revenue growth finishing above our guidance range with record U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 70 basis point headwind over the prior year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 28% also exceeding our guidance range. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued through the fourth quarter, a primary reason for our strong U.S. revenue growth. 18:55 Also contributing was our success driving volume growth through the pharmacy channel due to continued Omnipod DASH adoption. Omnipod DASH drove over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 55% of our total U.S. volume. In Q4, International Omnipod revenue grew 6%, which was below our guidance range. Our growth was impacted by an estimated $5 million channel inventory reduction due to a European distributor returning to more normalized levels from the higher balanced carried throughout much of the pandemic. This occurred sooner than anticipated and it was not fully factored into our guidance. 19:42 It negatively impacted our Q4 growth rate by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, the majority of our revenue is sold through distributors in international regions, and fluctuations in inventory levels can impact our results. We also continue to be affected by increasing AID competition and the compounding impact of the pandemic on our annuity model. 20:07 On a reported basis for international Omnipod, foreign currency was a 180 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition and Pod utilization remained stable during Q4. Drug delivery revenue increased 113% during the fourth quarter finishing above our guidance range due to increased production volume driven by higher-than-expected demand from our partner. 20:34 Gross margin was 69.3% in the fourth quarter, representing a 380 basis point increase or 370 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, product mix in our improved manufacturing operations. These drivers were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. 21:05 Our year-end inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary pressure in 2021, and this is expected to continue in 2022. This will affect our gross margin in 2022 as we sell the product out of inventory. I will touch on that more in a few minutes. 21:27 Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to strategically invest in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing operations and international expansion. These investments are designed to fuel sustainable long-term growth and expand our total addressable market while we further advance our mission. Operating margin was 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.7%. Both showed an increase over prior year and were in line with our expectations as we grow profitably, while also investing across our business for long-term growth. 22:10 Turning to full year results, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 19% and total company revenue growth of 20% achieving another record year at 1.1 billion demonstrating the strength and durability of our annuity model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable to 2021 total revenue by 180 basis points. In 2021, we achieved gross margin of 68.4%, up 400 basis points and in line with our expectations. 22: 42 We are benefiting from our growing scale and global manufacturing efficiencies and mix benefit from growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and we also had lower one-time costs associated with the pandemic. These drivers were partially offset by expected higher costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating margin was 11.5% up 580 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 340 basis points. Both were a significant step up from prior year and consistent with our expectations. 23:24 Turning to cash and liquidity, we ended the year with over $790 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We entered 2022 in a strong financial position with a strategic roadmap to invest in critical areas of our business that will drive our innovation and growth for years to come. This past year, we took a series of steps to strengthen our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We are well positioned to finance our growth strategy. 24:01 More recently in the current quarter, we finalized the strategic vertical integration acquisition of one of our suppliers, which brings key intellectual property and expertise in-house, allowing us to strengthen our competitive moat, production capabilities and efficiency and drive further operational excellence while mitigating supply chain risks. We have also taken additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. We have optimized operations in China by consolidating production in that region into one location. We also plan to invest in a new international manufacturing location to further diversify globally and increase efficiency consistent with our goal to drive higher gross margins over time. 24:51 Now turning to our outlook for 2022 for the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 15% to 20% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 16%, by product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 23%. Our growth within Type 1 and Type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. We will also benefit from the commercial release of Omnipod 5 and we anticipate this latest innovation will begin to contribute to growth this year and even more so over the long term. 25:39 We expect growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half as we gain momentum from the launch of Omnipod 5, begin to move past pandemic headwinds and realize the benefits of other commercial investments. As a reminder, the launch of Omnipod 5 and its adoption ramp will take time due to the nature of our annuity model and given we are in limited market release for a period of time before transitioning to full market release. 26:10 For international Omnipod, we expect full year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of AID competition and pandemic related headwinds. We expect international to remain a long-term strategic growth driver and we will continue investing with a focus to expand our global footprint and to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 26:40 We expect international revenue growth to also be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half resulting from a slightly easier comparison, as well as expected improving conditions related to COVID. For drug delivery, we expect revenue to decline 30% to 35% as levels were elevated during the pandemic. 27:04 Turning to gross margin for full year 2022, we expect to achieve gross margin of 67% to 68% and expect it to be higher in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. We expect the decline from prior year is driven by product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. 27:36 We expect this to be partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Looking beyond 2022, we fully expect to continue to expand gross margin over the long term as we begin to see the full benefit of our scale and manufacturing efficiencies. We still see 70% gross margin as a near-to mid-term goal and we are driving toward it. 28:04 During 2022, we expect operating expenses to rise slightly below our revenue growth as we further invest in key areas of our business while progressing our financial profitability. This includes investments in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, increased direct-to-consumer marketing and further scaling other commercial-related activities. We are also experiencing inflationary pressure within operating expenses. 2022 will be a pivotal year as we launch Omnipod 5 and strengthen our position in a large and rapidly expanding market that remains under-penetrated. We continue to invest heavily in innovation as our team advances Omnipod 5 internationally, our iOS development effort integration with Libre and G7 and much more. 28:57 This year to make the most of our Omnipod 5 launch, we expect the majority of operating expense growth will be within SG&A. Even with our increased investments and pressure from inflation, we continue to target operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points each year, which is our goal over the short and mid-term as we invest in long-term strategic growth drivers. 29:23 At the start of 2022, we adopted new accounting guidance that reduces most of the non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes to an insignificant amount, cash interest expense remains unchanged at approximately 30 million per year. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2022 will grow slightly from 2021 with continued investment throughout our business. 29:50 Turning now to our first quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect both total company growth and total Omnipod growth of 13% to 16%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 17% to 20%. We expect the core drivers will be the benefits of our recurring revenue model following consistent record setting new customer starts in 2021, an additional Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. 30:25 We expect Q1 international Omnipod growth of 6% to 10% driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition and the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021 largely due to the pandemic. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue growth of 20% to 25%. Q1 is expected to be higher than each of the subsequent quarters in the year due to production timing. 30:56 In conclusion, we completed another solid year of growth and strategic progress. The U.S. Omnipod 5 is launched, the preschool expanded indication filing is under active review at the FDA, we are advancing our Type 2 initiatives and our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are progressing. We expect 2022 to be a transformative year as we advance our strategy and build upon our existing competitive advantages to position Insulet for sustainable growth for years to come. 31:28 With that, we will turn the call over to Dalam to open the call for questions.\nOperator: 31:34 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: 32:07 Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the approval. I wanted to the start on the international side. If I add back the $5 million to the fourth quarter in terms of the inventory got down, the international is still down quarter-on-quarter, and is it just a function way to -- the inventory build in 2Q and 3Q that just got unwind (ph) within the fourth quarter and I guess just more specifically will be install base on a net basis increase over the last few quarters and then if there has been internet pricing changes in international markets, so it is still kind of related to the same question.\nWayde McMillan: 32:50 Sure. Hi, Jason. Thanks for the question. And we certainly are experiencing more tailwinds and momentum in the U.S. business in the international business, as you call out, we had this channel impact, it's something we've been monitoring actually throughout 2020. We had seen a distributor carrying higher inventory balances throughout the pandemic. And we were unexpectedly hit with it at the end of the quarter because in conversations with them, we didn't think they\u2019re going to be taking it down, but they did. So we didn't including guidance, as you said, it takes our growth rate, if you normalize for that up to about 12%. So pretty consistent with the growth that we've had throughout the year, 13% to 14% and so there is nothing really a regular to call out other than just normal order patterns with our distributors. 33:45 Most of our business internationally is through distributors and so it will ebb and flow between the quarters. So overall, our growth for the year ended up quarter-by-quarter over the four quarters between 12% and 14%, so pretty consistent. And as you know, we target low 20% growth to high-teens growth. And we've been off that over the last year for a couple of main reasons. Obviously, the pandemic has persisted longer and then an impact on our new customer starts, as well as the AID competition that we've called out as CGM has got approval in certain countries, AID systems are starting to take off. And as we've said in our prepared remarks, Shacey highlighted that we can't wait to get Omnipod 5 in international markets and participate in the segment of the market that's growing with AID. So that's the run down on our international business. 34:38 It's still strong growth, the base of business is growing. We're still double-digits to mid-to low-teens growth there, and we can't wait to bring more innovation with Omnipod 5 and get back into that targeted range where we think we can sustain that high-teens to low 20s type of growth.\nOperator: 34:59 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: 35:06 Thank you. This is Eric on for Josh. With your announcement today that you've submitted for CE Mark of Omnipod 5. Could you help us understand any milestones or timelines for O5 to receive an approval decision there? Is it safe to assume that an approval could be delivered in the second half of this year? And then I'll ask the follow-up to that now, you said that the U.S. limited launch will be three to five months, should we expect a similar timeline in the EU once you have CE Mark in hands.\nShacey Petrovic: 35:33 Great. Thanks, Eric for the question. Yes, we are excited to be under active review for CE Mark. We don't really have a timeline to share beyond that as you may know, this is a new regulatory pathway, the Medical Device Regulation pathway and obviously a complex submission. We know that data looks great and we're very confident in the quality of the submission, but it could take some time for us to secure this approval. So, we haven't given guidance for timing. Just wanted to let everybody know that we are under active review and looking forward to getting that out onto the market. 36:12 In terms of what the limited market release will look like, we are still finalizing that strategy, it's very likely that we would enter into select markets as part of the limited market release and then expand from there, very similar to how we rolled out DASH in our international markets where we started with a handful of markets as part of the limited market release and then expanded from there. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: 36:39 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: 36:45 Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the limited launch and the impact it's having on user buying patterns and new patient starts. U.S. had a good fourth quarter, but I would say first quarter is looking a little below where the Street was thinking for the U.S. and for the full year as well. So would love to just get a sense of what you're seeing in those buying patterns and if patients are waiting.\nShacey Petrovic: 37:22 Sure, Robbie. Maybe I'll start and then Wayde can speak to what's factored into the guidance for Q1. But it's just been a few weeks and the limited market release is progressing exactly as planned. I think feedback from those participating in it has been terrific and we're getting the early insights that we are looking for as we had said, what we're looking for is sort of testing our training pathways are onboarding our product experience, all while the team continues to build access. And so, so far so good, although it is early days, but we are encouraged. And as it relates to buying patterns, I think you would look at the fourth quarter in the U.S., which was very strong and ahead of our expectations and it doesn't -- it wouldn't indicate that people are waiting for Omnipod 5 just given how strong the quarter was. I'm sure there are people out there that are waiting for Omnipod 5 to get onto Omnipod, but certainly the performance in the fourth quarter would indicate that.\nWayde McMillan: 38:28 Great. And regarding guidance Robbie, one thing we have to keep in mind when we compare Q4 to Q1 is the seasonality, particularly in the U.S. and a couple of years ago, we thought that that may wane somewhat with move up volume into the pharmacy channel, but similar to what we experienced last year from 2020 into '21 and is that there are just inherent built-in behaviors in people start stocking up with more pods in Q4 and driving seasonality higher in Q4. And then, as a result lower in Q1. 39:08 So we're following those similar trends in our guidance, and we'll wait and see if in fact that does wane this year or not, but our expectation is, given the strength of the utilization in Q4 and what we learned last year of just what's built into the marketplace and people buying behavior that we'll still see pretty strong behavior -- pretty strong buying behavior in Q4, even though we've moved good percentage over half of our volume into the pharmacy channel.\nOperator: 39:39 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: 39:48 Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Shacey, did I hear you say the limited launch would be three to nine months or three to five months.\nShacey Petrovic: 39:55 Three to nine. We haven't changed our estimate on that. That's what we've been saying all along.\nLawrence Biegelsen: 40:01 And so my question is kind of what gets you to kind of the why such a wide range what would get you to the low end of that versus the high end of that, if you will, the nine months and what is the goal for covered lives, you start exiting 2022. Thanks for taking my question.\nShacey Petrovic: 40:19 Yeah. Thanks, Larry. So moving through to full market release is really dependent on just getting the number of days of use across our different customer journeys. So we have MDI users getting onboard, traditional tube pump users getting onboard, people coming from Omnipod and people who are coming from CGM or CGM naive. So we look across each of those and want to confirm the training pathways, we want to confirm the on-boarding pathways and of course, the product experience. So if all of that goes flawlessly, then we'll be at three months. If we learned some things in that that we want to address, then that may push us closer to six or nine months. 41:05 And while we're doing that, we're also working to build access. And so once we've got the customer experience, where we want it, and then we've got access where we want it, which we don't expect really to be a governing factor that's when will move into full market release. We just know there's going to be enthusiastic demand out there and we want to make sure we've got the best possible customer experience in best possible access position. And so I guess three months really would assume that we recruit everybody at the pace that we want to and that the experience is flawless and nine months would assume that we're learning some things that we want to address.\nBret Christensen: 41:45 Yeah, Larry. Its Bret. I'll just add that one of the reasons why it's important is, we want to move quickly at the full market release. And so some of the systems that we're testing during the LMR or the ordering process, the onboarding process, both of which provide tremendous amount of self-service for our users. Remember, we don't have a four-year lock-in period with our user base and so there's going to be a tremendous amount of demand from existing podders to move to Omnipod 5. We want them to be able to self-serve, and it\u2019s a self-start on the product and so the reason why those systems need to move go flawlessly as Shacey puts is so we can move really quickly and continue to focus on new starts during the FMR. 42:25 And so what we're testing those two parts of the system along with access as you mentioned, but access is going to be probably not the limiting factor to get to full market release, because we had a head start, we were said that we were ahead -- well ahead of where we were at with DASH before we launched that product. So access will probably be an acceptable level. And once we get comfortable with those two systems, the ordering and on-boarding process that will enable us to move really quickly during FMR.\nOperator: 42:53 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: 43:01 Hi. This is Brandon on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the 2022 guidance. There is a lot of moving pieces. A lot of good and exciting things going on through the year. So I was wondering, if you could just talk about what is and what is not factored into that guidance. And I guess the three maybe things that I would focus on are one what's factored in for the global or let's say a cadence of global launch of Omnipod 5. What are you considering for a mix of Type 2 as a percent of users. And then maybe DTC investments, what are those factored into guidance is kind of ramping up. So, any color around those dynamics and what is and what is not factored in the guidance would be helpful.\nWayde McMillan: 43:46 Hi. Sure, Brandon. Its Wayde, I can start that one, and then I'm sure, Bret would like to jump in on a couple of the business drivers that you mentioned. So our 2022 guide for the U.S. 18% to 23%, very strong guide in fact at the high end similar to the growth we had in 2021 off of much higher base and in across all of our high-end guidance product lines U.S. International, we achieved the high end, they will be record setting revenue basis for us again. And so even though the percentages are slightly lower than last year, the dollar growth rates are really what we need to keep an eye on given the size of our existing base from year-to-year and so specific things that are in the guidance, obviously in the U.S. we are including the launch of Omnipod 5. 44:41 What we have scenarios running on and have to watch is just as Shacey and Bret talked about whether we're at the low end three months and where the full market release or if it takes us to nine months. And given the annuity model that we sell-through in the pharmacy channel with our pay-as-you-go model, it is a pretty significant difference to the year whether we get it at the three months or at the nine months, end of the range. And so that's something we'll be monitoring very closely throughout the year. The mix of Type 2 is interesting, again it will be Omnipod 5 dependent. We've been pretty consistent at 35% to 40% of our new customer starts have been Type 2 over the last few quarters and throughout 2021 and so that's what we would expect it to be. However as Omnipod 5 ramps and Omnipod 5 has Type 1 indication as Shacey said in our prepared remarks we're working on Type 2. So we do think that the type 2 mix could be lower as Omnipod 5 ramps, given that it's indicated for Type 1 only at this point in time. 45:43 And then from a DTC standpoint, we have had really good success in driving an increasing awareness for our products. Bret maybe you could talk to where the market stands today on lack of awareness and why we think DTC is still a strong driver for us.\nBret Christensen: 46:00 Yeah. Thanks, Wayde. So I think once we get to Omnipod 5 what we really will have the most complete offering. We pointed to the lack of an AID system is being a headwind for us, not just internationally, but the U.S., but we've had these tailwinds of pharmacy Type 2 and DTC and in my mind, when we add AID now to the best form factor in the marketplace in Omnipod awareness becomes the next frontier for us. So we've already made tremendous strides in DTC, TV commercials, our learnings in converting those leads that come in to new starts have been tremendous. 46:40 And I look forward to the improved messaging in the addition of AID to Omnipod. That should be an enhancement to DTC at a better message and should drive even better conversion rates. So it\u2019s something we'll continue to do. We look forward to doing it throughout the year. And you'll see our message evolve as we approach the full market release of Omnipod 5 to include that AID message in those TV commercials.\nShacey Petrovic: 47:04 And Brandan just one note, although we are really excited to have them both under active review, the preschool expansion and international Omnipod 5 are not factored into our guidance.\nOperator: 47:17 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: 47:25 Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Shacey you just kind of took my last question there on whether or not Omnipod 5 was in international markets. But let me ask, kind of, I guess maybe a more detailed international question. So I know that MDR pathway is tough to predict. Do we think is six to 12 months a conservative window anyway to put any kind of guide rails on that at all number one, but more importantly, once you do get CE Mark and let's just -- let's say it's July 1 or something like that, if that were to happen, is there another six-month window we have to think about, 12-month window to think about. What's the window that didn't get on reimbursement in some of your largest countries whether that's France or Germany or I think UK something like that, how long would it take to actually get reimbursed for O5 so that it could start contributing more meaningfully to your international revenue? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: 48:12 Yeah, Jeff. It's such a good question because there is a lot of work in terms of market development and we talk about Europe or international as if it's one thing, but we all know, Europe is 20 for us, 20 plus different countries, different business models, different market registrations and different reimbursement pathways. The good news is we have that work underway. So we have teams who are doing the market development work today, but there will be work, depending on the market, some will go faster and some will go slower in terms of establishing coverage and access for Omnipod 5. So I can't really put a window on MDR. We are one of -- it's still early days for MDR, and so the pathway is just not that established. We're very confident in the submission. And we are under review, but it's one of the reasons why it's not built into guidance this year. It's just -- it's an unpredictable pathway at this point. We will let you know obviously as we make progress there. 49:12 And I would say we will move into a market release that looks -- limited market release that looks fairly similar to what we have in the U.S., just based on the need to do that remaining market development work in terms of establishing access and market registrations, et cetera, once we have CE Mark.\nOperator: 49:38 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: 49:45 Good evening and thank you for taking the question. You certainly have a lot going on, but I do want to ask about Libre 3 and G7. And it's a two-part question. How long do you think it takes to integrate it with Omnipod 5 and is that something that needs to be submitted by you buy them or what's the regulatory pathway?\nShacey Petrovic: 50:13 Great. Joanne, yeah, it's a very exciting pipeline, we've talked now today about preschoolers and the international launch, and of course, CGM integrations, Type 2 and iOS, so there is a lot going on very exciting. I think everything is progressing well. The work to integrate with G7 and with Libre has been underway for quite some time. And so that is making good progress there. Based on ICGM pathway and clearance for DexCom and G7 there should not be actually a regulatory submission. That's one of the beautiful things about the interoperable pathway. And so that should go relatively straightforward and the long pole in the tent there really is the technical work. 51:04 And right now, Libre may require likely to require a submission, that work is underway as well. We own those submission, so it's our responsibility to work with our partners to do the development work and get the regulatory clinical and technical support that we need and then those submissions would be ours to manage.\nOperator: 51:28 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: 51:35 Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and I haven't had a chance to congratulate you on Omnipod 5 approval, very exciting. I have a two-part question. So first internationally, I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit more about why AID's are still much more competitive internationally versus the U.S., I mean you guys have still had very strong growth in the U.S., I appreciate with an AID more competitive. But it feels like the pressure is greater internationally. 52:07 And then the second part of the question is on limited market release and sort of how, what exactly you're looking to learn. Is that how to best train the patients and the clinicians, is it looking for patient feedback, is it about patients selection. We just love a little bit more color about the learnings that come from the limited market release. Thank you so much.\nShacey Petrovic: 52:26 Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. And maybe I'll start with a limited market release question and then Brett can give some insight into the international market dynamics around AID. For the limited market release, what we're really looking to understand as Brett said, remember we don't lock our users into four-year agreements. And so that means that everybody who has market access and coverage and has access to Omnipod 5. So that's could be 10s of thousands, if not more than 100,000 users in the United States. And so we certainly want them to be able to get onto product, but we want them to be able to self-serve, so there are training pathways that are purely virtual for these different patient segments. 53:12 So if you are on Omnipod today and DexCom, you should not even need to meet with a clinician or a physician to be able to get onto the product, you need a prescription and to go through our training pathways. So that's an example of something that we want to test that pathway, make sure that everybody is satisfied and having a good experience and good success with the product after the training. And then there are a myriad of other patient pathways, the MDI user will have a different training pathway that does involve for example meeting with a physician and most of this is really focused on the user as opposed to the clinician, the product itself is incredibly simple, it's been designed to be as hands off as possible for the physician's office and to be very simple to use for the patient. So those are the types of things that we are testing and we just need to make sure that we get a good amount of patients across each of those patient pathways. 54:06 And then we have good feedback and confidence in the experience across each of those pathways, and then of course, we're building access in the background. But those are the types of things that we're looking to test. And then I'll ask Brett to take the second part of your question.\nBret Christensen: 54:20 Yeah. Hi, Danielle. Its Bret. For AID competition internationally I know it does appear that it's stronger than it was in the U.S., but a couple of things. One, we've had AID competition in the U.S. for about six years now. So it's just been something we've been living with and there are tailwinds in the U.S. that have helped us, it just don't exist to the same extent in our international markets and those are really three things, one is Type 2, remember with 35% to 40% of all of our new starts coming from Type 2 that doesn't exist internationally. And if so, if you were to take that out of the U.S. number you'd see significantly lower results with new starts, that's one. 55:02 The second is really the pharmacy lift. So both the pharmacy experience as well as the premium we get of pricing of Pods in the pharmacy channel, it helps our revenues in the U.S. And the third really is DTC that's been really significant for us over the last few years, it's been a significant spend. It's not really available to all of our markets outside the U.S. So that's something that -- although it's something we've tried in markets like Germany, Canada, it's not something we can do everywhere. And then, yeah, just that the pay-as-you-go models that really is the benefit, the pharmacy in the U.S. is something we're working on in our international markets, but just not to the extent that we have it today. So AID is new in our international markets. So it's a change and something that we're feeling today and we just got to work on those tailwinds, so that we have that list between now and when we launch Omnipod 5 to compete better internationally.\nOperator: 55:59 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: 56:07 Thank you for taking the question. I saw that you had said in the prepared remarks that you're making progress on the iOS development, Apple development. Could you just give us an update there and talk about next steps and any color on timing that you can give for that.\nShacey Petrovic: 56:27 Sure, Matt. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We do -- we have had the iOS work underway for a while and there is no timeline update there, but I can tell you that the work is going well and we certainly are excited about it. Our plan has always been to take the learnings from our limited market release with our phone control on Android and factor those into the submission, and the launch plan for iOS. And so we do want to wait to get through that, before we would end up submitting, but right now, that's not the long pole in the tent, it's likely to be the completion of the technical work. This does require a 510(K) submission. So we are going to wrap up our technical work and then factor in any learnings from our limited market release with Android full phone control and then submit that for 510(K) clearance to the FDA.\nOperator: 57:24 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nSteve Lichtman: 57:33 Thank you. Hi, everyone. Just wondering how we should think about the potential for Omnipod 5 to positively impact new patient flow even before the full launch, I think, Shacey, you've talked in the past about given no capital upfront that people who are on Omnipod can switch to 5 once available, does that provide an opportunity for you, even if you're not explicitly building it into 2022 guidance.\nShacey Petrovic: 58:06 Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I guess I would point to Q4 as an example or an illustration of the fact that I think people get the business model, right. What we are trying to avoid there is a slowdown before a new innovation launches and just helping educate clinicians and customers that they can get on the product and they'll be able to convert over to Omnipod 5 once their insurer covers the product. And I think the main focus there is to ensure that we don't see a step back as we bring new innovation to market and I think Q4 is illustrative of the fact that people get it and they're not delaying their choice to get on product as we get closer and closer to the launch of Omnipod 5. So I wouldn't necessarily look at it as an upside, but I think it's a great indication of the power of the business model that we don't slow down as we bring new innovation to market and that's very exciting. It's a great thing for patients and it's a great thing for Insulet.\nBret Christensen: 59:06 Yeah. Steve, this is Bret. Part of our message to both health care providers and patients is that, the quickest pathways Omnipod 5 is to be on DASH today because there is self-service training component for anybody that's on DASH. So the training doesn't become a bottleneck for anybody that wants to start on Omnipod 5 right away. The best thing they really can't do is start on DASH today go through the training, so that when Omnipod 5 comes out in a full market release fashion they're able to self-serve on that training and more quickly onboard with Omnipod 5. So that's the message that's resonating. Shacey [indiscernible] agree it's not really driving additional new starts, but it is preventing people from waiting, which is what we're trying to do.\nWayde McMillan: 59:53 Yeah. And then, Steve, I could just pick up on the guidance part of that question. The way to think about it is, if we're at the shorter three to six months end of the limited market release period that helps push us to the higher end of the guide. If we end up more in that six to nine months\u2019 timeframe, then that's one of the reasons that could push us to the lower end of the guide. And then, obviously depending on how successful we are with Omnipod 5 throughout the year it starts to build into our annuity model and can help us at the end of the year or as we build momentum into 2023.\nOperator: 60:28 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O'Brien: 60:36 Good Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So we say six months for the limited market release that gets us to kind of August, early September. I mean it's kind of dovetails off what Steve was just asking about the conversion factor. Are you going to be able to kind of go full bore after new patients with O5 right away or are you reps really going to be spending a lot of time figuring how to convert existing patients to O5? And so they're really not going to able to get after selling Omnipod 5 to new patients until probably more so in 2023. Thanks.\nBret Christensen: 61:15 Yeah, Matt. Hi. This is Bret. I can take that one. Our sales reps are compensated on new starts and new to Omnipod starts. So they're going to want to focus on really building our customer base and starting brand new users that are coming from MDI or from a tube pump conversion that are new to Omnipod. Those tools that we talked about both the ordering process and the on-boarding process should allow them to do that to focus solely on new starts. That is our intent. As we think about this pay-as-you-go model, this no upfront fee and patients will always be able to upgrade to the latest Omnipod technology, that's a good thing. And it's one of the reasons why we've been spending years now building these self-service tools in anticipation for the launch of Omnipod 5, so that we can innovate in short cycles and people will always be able to self-serve and upgrade to the latest version of Omnipod. And so that is our intent, it is one of the reasons why we've put this range on the LMR because we've got to test those system, so we've had people on product remember for over a year. We're pretty confident that Omnipod 5 is a fantastic product that people love it. These systems develop ordering and onboarding our new and we're testing this in the LMR because that is our intent, we want the sales and marketing teams to focus on new starts and we want existing partners to really quickly migrate to Omnipod 5 on their own.\nOperator: 62:35 Thank you. I'm showing our last question in the queue comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nKyle Rose: 62:44 Great. Good evening, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in. So I wanted to just ask a more of a bigger picture I guess business model question. Wayde, I think you reiterated the comment about future years of leverage being in the ballpark of 100 bps. And I guess I'm just trying to understand if you could unpack that for us just a little bit, when I think about the work you're doing on manufacturing. I think about the some of the investments you're making. I understand that they take investments upfront, but they do appear to be more scalable long-term thinking, things like the pharmacy channel, patient led onboarding, DTC advertising. I guess maybe what additional investments from a fixed cost or an infrastructure perspective, need to be put in place that would kind of constrain that to only 100 bps year-over-year moving forward assuming the topline growth is there.\nWayde McMillan: 63:34 Yeah. Good afternoon, Kyle. And this is key to our financial thesis. The summary level is that we see ourselves in a very differentiated position in a leadership position within a very large total available market here both the Type 1 and the Type 2 and a leadership position in it, and so we want to be able to continue to invest to capitalize on that leadership position and so we're going to do that through major areas. Our R&D being one of the largest one of the ones you didn't mentioned, but significant investments in driving innovation for years to come. As Shacey said in our prepared remarks, we've talked publicly about a lot of the projects that we have that now have clinical submission timelines. But of course, behind that, our pipeline is also being invested in for significant advancements in further generations of our current products for TAM expansion, for international expansion. So just a lot coming in the pipeline. So heavy investment in R&D to continue in this -- to continue penetrating in this large available market for us. 64:46 And then as you mentioned manufacturing, I want to make sure capacity stays ahead obviously. You mentioned leveraging the pharmacy channel. You're right, it is a more efficient channel for us. We've got over half of our volume flowing through the pharmacy now and so we are getting benefits from that. But as Brett mentioned earlier, we're also making investments in direct-to-consumer, we see pretty heavy lift to drive awareness and that the majority of the market for Type 2 and almost all the -- pardon me -- for Type 1 and almost all of the market for Type 2 is still more people who are using multiple daily injections, and so we've got a big job to do in developing the market and DTC is one of the areas that we're going to do that, but we're also continuing to invest in our sales force to drive those initiatives in both the Type 1 and Type 2 space. 65:32 And then the other major area of investment is on the international expansion side, which is pretty significant investment, as Shacey highlighted earlier around the regulatory and government affairs, as well as all the capabilities needed to deliver our product in those regions. And so we see ourselves continuing in this heavy investment cycle, but as you mentioned, we also want to continue to strengthen our financial profile. We had a nice step-up in operating margins and EBITDA this year and we did that intentionally to get ourselves to a place where we're much stronger financially and now we're going to build on that, from year-to-year. And we're targeting 100 basis points of improvement each year and we're going to continue to step our way to that stronger financial profile. So that's the plan for us over time, continuing to take advantage of our leadership in differentiated position here. While also building a stronger financial profile for the company.\nOperator: 66:29 Thank you sir, I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic for closing.\nShacey Petrovic: 66:36 Thank you, Dalam. I want to take a moment to share some of the unsolicited and wonderful feedback we've received from Omnipod 5 users during what has been just a few weeks of limited market release. Bethany, mother of a one-year-old shared a quote, Omnipod 5 has allowed me to be more present for my son, because I'm not constantly thinking about my own diabetes; and Kevin, father of a 16-year-old is a laided about how Omnipod 5 has changed their lives. He shared a quote today with the third morning in a row my son woke up with perfect blood sugar and no overnight lows. Omnipod 5 is a dream come true. And finally John, who has been on a pump for over two decades shared his lifetime of personal challenges and frustration managing has diabetes. In his words, quote diabetes has taken its toll on me mentally I bottled up and try to stay strong for my wife, my kids and those who love me I am tired. With Omnipod 5 I've slept through the night uninterrupted for the first time in a very long time. Thank you for all your hard work to make this dream a reality. So we cannot wait to bring Omnipod 5 and its unmatched benefits to the broader diabetes community. So that it can help millions of more people just like it's doing for Bethany, Kevin and John and their families. Thanks again for joining us today and have a great evening.\nOperator: 68:04 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "18:01 Thank you, Shacey. Our fourth quarter performance closed out another year of progress for Insulet on many fronts. Our focused investments and consistent execution of our strategic imperatives continue to strengthen our financial profile while driving meaningful value for all of our stakeholders. 18:20 In the fourth quarter, we generated 26% revenue growth finishing above our guidance range with record U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 70 basis point headwind over the prior year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 28% also exceeding our guidance range. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued through the fourth quarter, a primary reason for our strong U.S. revenue growth. 18:55 Also contributing was our success driving volume growth through the pharmacy channel due to continued Omnipod DASH adoption. Omnipod DASH drove over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 55% of our total U.S. volume. In Q4, International Omnipod revenue grew 6%, which was below our guidance range. Our growth was impacted by an estimated $5 million channel inventory reduction due to a European distributor returning to more normalized levels from the higher balanced carried throughout much of the pandemic. This occurred sooner than anticipated and it was not fully factored into our guidance. 19:42 It negatively impacted our Q4 growth rate by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, the majority of our revenue is sold through distributors in international regions, and fluctuations in inventory levels can impact our results. We also continue to be affected by increasing AID competition and the compounding impact of the pandemic on our annuity model. 20:07 On a reported basis for international Omnipod, foreign currency was a 180 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition and Pod utilization remained stable during Q4. Drug delivery revenue increased 113% during the fourth quarter finishing above our guidance range due to increased production volume driven by higher-than-expected demand from our partner. 20:34 Gross margin was 69.3% in the fourth quarter, representing a 380 basis point increase or 370 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, product mix in our improved manufacturing operations. These drivers were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. 21:05 Our year-end inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary pressure in 2021, and this is expected to continue in 2022. This will affect our gross margin in 2022 as we sell the product out of inventory. I will touch on that more in a few minutes. 21:27 Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to strategically invest in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing operations and international expansion. These investments are designed to fuel sustainable long-term growth and expand our total addressable market while we further advance our mission. Operating margin was 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.7%. Both showed an increase over prior year and were in line with our expectations as we grow profitably, while also investing across our business for long-term growth. 22:10 Turning to full year results, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 19% and total company revenue growth of 20% achieving another record year at 1.1 billion demonstrating the strength and durability of our annuity model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable to 2021 total revenue by 180 basis points. In 2021, we achieved gross margin of 68.4%, up 400 basis points and in line with our expectations. 22: 42 We are benefiting from our growing scale and global manufacturing efficiencies and mix benefit from growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and we also had lower one-time costs associated with the pandemic. These drivers were partially offset by expected higher costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating margin was 11.5% up 580 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 340 basis points. Both were a significant step up from prior year and consistent with our expectations. 23:24 Turning to cash and liquidity, we ended the year with over $790 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We entered 2022 in a strong financial position with a strategic roadmap to invest in critical areas of our business that will drive our innovation and growth for years to come. This past year, we took a series of steps to strengthen our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We are well positioned to finance our growth strategy. 24:01 More recently in the current quarter, we finalized the strategic vertical integration acquisition of one of our suppliers, which brings key intellectual property and expertise in-house, allowing us to strengthen our competitive moat, production capabilities and efficiency and drive further operational excellence while mitigating supply chain risks. We have also taken additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. We have optimized operations in China by consolidating production in that region into one location. We also plan to invest in a new international manufacturing location to further diversify globally and increase efficiency consistent with our goal to drive higher gross margins over time. 24:51 Now turning to our outlook for 2022 for the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 15% to 20% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 16%, by product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 23%. Our growth within Type 1 and Type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. We will also benefit from the commercial release of Omnipod 5 and we anticipate this latest innovation will begin to contribute to growth this year and even more so over the long term. 25:39 We expect growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half as we gain momentum from the launch of Omnipod 5, begin to move past pandemic headwinds and realize the benefits of other commercial investments. As a reminder, the launch of Omnipod 5 and its adoption ramp will take time due to the nature of our annuity model and given we are in limited market release for a period of time before transitioning to full market release. 26:10 For international Omnipod, we expect full year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of AID competition and pandemic related headwinds. We expect international to remain a long-term strategic growth driver and we will continue investing with a focus to expand our global footprint and to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 26:40 We expect international revenue growth to also be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half resulting from a slightly easier comparison, as well as expected improving conditions related to COVID. For drug delivery, we expect revenue to decline 30% to 35% as levels were elevated during the pandemic. 27:04 Turning to gross margin for full year 2022, we expect to achieve gross margin of 67% to 68% and expect it to be higher in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. We expect the decline from prior year is driven by product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. 27:36 We expect this to be partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Looking beyond 2022, we fully expect to continue to expand gross margin over the long term as we begin to see the full benefit of our scale and manufacturing efficiencies. We still see 70% gross margin as a near-to mid-term goal and we are driving toward it. 28:04 During 2022, we expect operating expenses to rise slightly below our revenue growth as we further invest in key areas of our business while progressing our financial profitability. This includes investments in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, increased direct-to-consumer marketing and further scaling other commercial-related activities. We are also experiencing inflationary pressure within operating expenses. 2022 will be a pivotal year as we launch Omnipod 5 and strengthen our position in a large and rapidly expanding market that remains under-penetrated. We continue to invest heavily in innovation as our team advances Omnipod 5 internationally, our iOS development effort integration with Libre and G7 and much more. 28:57 This year to make the most of our Omnipod 5 launch, we expect the majority of operating expense growth will be within SG&A. Even with our increased investments and pressure from inflation, we continue to target operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points each year, which is our goal over the short and mid-term as we invest in long-term strategic growth drivers. 29:23 At the start of 2022, we adopted new accounting guidance that reduces most of the non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes to an insignificant amount, cash interest expense remains unchanged at approximately 30 million per year. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2022 will grow slightly from 2021 with continued investment throughout our business. 29:50 Turning now to our first quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect both total company growth and total Omnipod growth of 13% to 16%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 17% to 20%. We expect the core drivers will be the benefits of our recurring revenue model following consistent record setting new customer starts in 2021, an additional Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. 30:25 We expect Q1 international Omnipod growth of 6% to 10% driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition and the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021 largely due to the pandemic. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue growth of 20% to 25%. Q1 is expected to be higher than each of the subsequent quarters in the year due to production timing. 30:56 In conclusion, we completed another solid year of growth and strategic progress. The U.S. Omnipod 5 is launched, the preschool expanded indication filing is under active review at the FDA, we are advancing our Type 2 initiatives and our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are progressing. We expect 2022 to be a transformative year as we advance our strategy and build upon our existing competitive advantages to position Insulet for sustainable growth for years to come. 31:28 With that, we will turn the call over to Dalam to open the call for questions. 32:50 Sure. Hi, Jason. Thanks for the question. And we certainly are experiencing more tailwinds and momentum in the U.S. business in the international business, as you call out, we had this channel impact, it's something we've been monitoring actually throughout 2020. We had seen a distributor carrying higher inventory balances throughout the pandemic. And we were unexpectedly hit with it at the end of the quarter because in conversations with them, we didn't think they're going to be taking it down, but they did. So we didn't including guidance, as you said, it takes our growth rate, if you normalize for that up to about 12%. So pretty consistent with the growth that we've had throughout the year, 13% to 14% and so there is nothing really a regular to call out other than just normal order patterns with our distributors. 33:45 Most of our business internationally is through distributors and so it will ebb and flow between the quarters. So overall, our growth for the year ended up quarter-by-quarter over the four quarters between 12% and 14%, so pretty consistent. And as you know, we target low 20% growth to high-teens growth. And we've been off that over the last year for a couple of main reasons. Obviously, the pandemic has persisted longer and then an impact on our new customer starts, as well as the AID competition that we've called out as CGM has got approval in certain countries, AID systems are starting to take off. And as we've said in our prepared remarks, Shacey highlighted that we can't wait to get Omnipod 5 in international markets and participate in the segment of the market that's growing with AID. So that's the run down on our international business. 34:38 It's still strong growth, the base of business is growing. We're still double-digits to mid-to low-teens growth there, and we can't wait to bring more innovation with Omnipod 5 and get back into that targeted range where we think we can sustain that high-teens to low 20s type of growth. 38:28 Great. And regarding guidance Robbie, one thing we have to keep in mind when we compare Q4 to Q1 is the seasonality, particularly in the U.S. and a couple of years ago, we thought that that may wane somewhat with move up volume into the pharmacy channel, but similar to what we experienced last year from 2020 into '21 and is that there are just inherent built-in behaviors in people start stocking up with more pods in Q4 and driving seasonality higher in Q4. And then, as a result lower in Q1. 39:08 So we're following those similar trends in our guidance, and we'll wait and see if in fact that does wane this year or not, but our expectation is, given the strength of the utilization in Q4 and what we learned last year of just what's built into the marketplace and people buying behavior that we'll still see pretty strong behavior -- pretty strong buying behavior in Q4, even though we've moved good percentage over half of our volume into the pharmacy channel. 43:46 Hi. Sure, Brandon. Its Wayde, I can start that one, and then I'm sure, Bret would like to jump in on a couple of the business drivers that you mentioned. So our 2022 guide for the U.S. 18% to 23%, very strong guide in fact at the high end similar to the growth we had in 2021 off of much higher base and in across all of our high-end guidance product lines U.S. International, we achieved the high end, they will be record setting revenue basis for us again. And so even though the percentages are slightly lower than last year, the dollar growth rates are really what we need to keep an eye on given the size of our existing base from year-to-year and so specific things that are in the guidance, obviously in the U.S. we are including the launch of Omnipod 5. 44:41 What we have scenarios running on and have to watch is just as Shacey and Bret talked about whether we're at the low end three months and where the full market release or if it takes us to nine months. And given the annuity model that we sell-through in the pharmacy channel with our pay-as-you-go model, it is a pretty significant difference to the year whether we get it at the three months or at the nine months, end of the range. And so that's something we'll be monitoring very closely throughout the year. The mix of Type 2 is interesting, again it will be Omnipod 5 dependent. We've been pretty consistent at 35% to 40% of our new customer starts have been Type 2 over the last few quarters and throughout 2021 and so that's what we would expect it to be. However as Omnipod 5 ramps and Omnipod 5 has Type 1 indication as Shacey said in our prepared remarks we're working on Type 2. So we do think that the type 2 mix could be lower as Omnipod 5 ramps, given that it's indicated for Type 1 only at this point in time. 45:43 And then from a DTC standpoint, we have had really good success in driving an increasing awareness for our products. Bret maybe you could talk to where the market stands today on lack of awareness and why we think DTC is still a strong driver for us. 59:53 Yeah. And then, Steve, I could just pick up on the guidance part of that question. The way to think about it is, if we're at the shorter three to six months end of the limited market release period that helps push us to the higher end of the guide. If we end up more in that six to nine months' timeframe, then that's one of the reasons that could push us to the lower end of the guide. And then, obviously depending on how successful we are with Omnipod 5 throughout the year it starts to build into our annuity model and can help us at the end of the year or as we build momentum into 2023. 63:34 Yeah. Good afternoon, Kyle. And this is key to our financial thesis. The summary level is that we see ourselves in a very differentiated position in a leadership position within a very large total available market here both the Type 1 and the Type 2 and a leadership position in it, and so we want to be able to continue to invest to capitalize on that leadership position and so we're going to do that through major areas. Our R&D being one of the largest one of the ones you didn't mentioned, but significant investments in driving innovation for years to come. As Shacey said in our prepared remarks, we've talked publicly about a lot of the projects that we have that now have clinical submission timelines. But of course, behind that, our pipeline is also being invested in for significant advancements in further generations of our current products for TAM expansion, for international expansion. So just a lot coming in the pipeline. So heavy investment in R&D to continue in this -- to continue penetrating in this large available market for us. 64:46 And then as you mentioned manufacturing, I want to make sure capacity stays ahead obviously. You mentioned leveraging the pharmacy channel. You're right, it is a more efficient channel for us. We've got over half of our volume flowing through the pharmacy now and so we are getting benefits from that. But as Brett mentioned earlier, we're also making investments in direct-to-consumer, we see pretty heavy lift to drive awareness and that the majority of the market for Type 2 and almost all the -- pardon me -- for Type 1 and almost all of the market for Type 2 is still more people who are using multiple daily injections, and so we've got a big job to do in developing the market and DTC is one of the areas that we're going to do that, but we're also continuing to invest in our sales force to drive those initiatives in both the Type 1 and Type 2 space. 65:32 And then the other major area of investment is on the international expansion side, which is pretty significant investment, as Shacey highlighted earlier around the regulatory and government affairs, as well as all the capabilities needed to deliver our product in those regions. And so we see ourselves continuing in this heavy investment cycle, but as you mentioned, we also want to continue to strengthen our financial profile. We had a nice step-up in operating margins and EBITDA this year and we did that intentionally to get ourselves to a place where we're much stronger financially and now we're going to build on that, from year-to-year. And we're targeting 100 basis points of improvement each year and we're going to continue to step our way to that stronger financial profile. So that's the plan for us over time, continuing to take advantage of our leadership in differentiated position here. While also building a stronger financial profile for the company."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "02:21 Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results mark the end of another year of strong growth, successful execution across our strategic imperatives and advancement of our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. 02:40 In 2021, we increased awareness and adoption of Omnipod in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, continued to unlock access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, expanded internationally and strengthened our global manufacturing operations. That momentum has continued into 2022 with the recent FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which we could not be more excited about. 03:05 While 2021 was a strong year, it certainly wasn't without its challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, global supply chain shortages and growing AID competition, particularly in our international markets. It is wonderful to see the global diabetes community embrace automated insulin delivery technology, and it is a clear indicator of how well received we believe Omnipod 5 will be. We are making great progress with our commercial rollout in the U.S. and advancing our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 03:40 The consistent strategic progress we have made is reflected in our financial results. In 2021, we surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, in line with the goal we provided in 2016 as part of our long-range plan. 2021 also marked our sixth consecutive year of 20% or more revenue growth and we now serve approximately 300,000 global customers using Omnipod. 04:08 We are already off to a terrific start in 2022 with a critical milestone. The FDA clearance and commercial launch of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that offers full compatible smartphone control and an advanced algorithm residing on the Pod. It has taken incredible effort and commitment by the Insulet team to reach this ground breaking achievement. 04:35 Omnipod 5 marks the greatest and most complex innovation Insulet has brought to market in our company's 20-year history. It offers unmatched innovation with a patient preferred form factor and it strengthens the value we provide customers today through our pay-as-you-go business model and U.S. pharmacy access. These distinctive benefits should provide us with unique competitive advantages in the market and we'll deliver life-changing technology to our customers. 05:04 Taking a step back, diabetes is a growing epidemic and the global markets remain critically underserved with low pump utilization. However, people with diabetes are adopting wearable technology at an increasing rate as CGM use and awareness accelerates. Our efforts to improve access to and awareness of Omnipod along with our customer-centric approach to innovation are driving continued Omnipod adoption. 05:31 In the U.S., we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injection and we remain a leader in the Type 2 market based on our form factor, the simplicity of our technology, demonstrated outcomes and broad affordable access through the pharmacy. Type 2 continues to represent between 35% and 40% of our new customers in the U.S. These trends offer significant growth opportunities for Insulet over the long-term, given Omnipod differentiated benefits, as well as our relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience. We expect to continue to drive Omnipod penetration, expand our total addressable market and grow our global market share. 06:17 I will now provide an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Expanding access to and awareness of Omnipod is essential to our strategy. Today for more people than ever Omnipod is available through our pay-as-you-go model in the U.S. pharmacy channel. 06:43 The pharmacy provides easier access and lower costs for the majority of our customers. Payers and Omnipod users are not burdened with four-year lock-in period. New technologies like Omnipod 5 can be adopted without upgrade or upfront fees and supplies can be picked up conveniently from a nearby pharmacy. For the payer, this means we assumed the risk through our pay-as-you-go business model, and for the Omnipod user it means easier access and affordability. 07:14 The enhanced experience in the pharmacy is great and is exactly why we are investing to expand access here. The primary driver of our growth over the last two years has been Omnipod DASH, and we have successfully secured broad access to this innovation globally. Almost all of our new customers in 2021 started on Omnipod DASH, and in the U.S., we've now secured almost 90% of covered lives for this product primarily in the pharmacy. 07:42 Essential to access is affordability. The vast majority of our U.S. consumers pay less than $50 each month for Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy, and the average is far less with many customers paying nothing. While the cost to users of Omnipod DASH is on par with multiple daily injections, Omnipod provides improved outcomes and quality of life. We continue to look for ways to reduce cost and the logistical and administrative hurdles for all customers, so they can access and afford Omnipod. 08:17 Our efforts to raise awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns is also helping to drive adoption. Our programs across the U.S. and select international markets are ramping and continue to drive a positive response and contribute to our customer growth. In 2022, we planned to expand our DTC efforts to drive increased awareness of Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5. Given our success to date, we are excited to see the impact our DTC campaign will have once Omnipod 5 is fully launched. 08:48 Delivering the best customer experience is at the heart of what we do. For 15 years, we've been using our unique form factor to simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 takes our innovation to the next level. It is the world's first phone controlled Pod based AID system, and we are confident it will build on our history of improving diabetes management as we leapfrog all other AIG system on the market. 09:17 Full phone control is far beyond what others in the market have been working on. With full phone control, there is no separate controller and there is no traditional pump. The entire experience is on body and on phone. No tubes and no pulling out the pump to dismiss an alarm, change pump settings or prime an infusion set. Full phone control is the next level of simplicity and sophistication, and it is an experience that is only possible with a true wearable form factor like Omnipod. We've redefined the category of insulin delivery. 09:50 In addition to being the first tubeless fully smartphone controlled AID system, Omnipod 5 includes customizable set point our smart adjust algorithm on the pod and a novel bolus calculator. This level of innovation required unusually complex regulatory submission, including three 510(K)s, three lead reviewers at the agency and thousands of pages of data. Our limited market release has already begun and the early customers are over the moon. 10:24 Limited market releases are best practiced with launches of major new innovations and ours is designed to test our customer training and support system, build access and ensure the best possible customer experience upon full market release. In addition to product innovation, we have also transformed how users access Omnipod through the pharmacy. Customers can now enjoy a simple on-boarding process and a modernized customer service platform. 10:54 We can verify pharmacy benefits in seconds, streamline complex paperwork request, enable our field teams to manage their pipelines more efficiently and facilitate a 100% digital pathway to access our products. During 2021, our market access teams contracted strong coverage for Omnipod 5 prior to FDA clearance. And we are now able to move more swiftly to expand coverage further as many payors waited for clearance to established coverage policy. 11:26 We expect to be in limited release for three to nine months and are excited to rollout our system more broadly as the year progresses. We can't wait for everyone to experience the simplicity and improved outcomes enjoyed by our clinical study participants. Omnipod 5 is the most anticipated innovation within the diabetes community and our team is laser-focused on ensuring the system is available to everyone. 11:52 Shortly after clearance, we also delivered our FDA submission to expand Omnipod 5's indication down to age two. This is important as we know the tremendous benefits Omnipod 5 can provide this vulnerable population and their caregivers and we continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. We recently completed our Type 2 feasibility study and look forward to sharing results at the ATTV diabetes conference in April. 12:21 We will take the learnings from this study to design our pivotal study with the intent to deliver Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 diabetes. We have proven to be a pioneer in the Type 2 space and expect continued strong adoption given the benefits of Omnipod DASH, our U.S. pharmacy channel access and now Omnipod 5. Even as we launch Omnipod 5, we continue to strategically invest in a robust product pipeline. Omnipod 5 is a platform that you'll see us advance in the coming years. 12:52 Our iOS app development is making terrific progress as is our integration work with both DexCom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are focused in three areas. We are working on advancements that will grow our addressable market. We are developing next-generation AID technology, and we are creating digital innovations and data products to make diabetes management easier for our podders. 13:21 Over the last several years, we have built on and enriched our digital platform capabilities. With SIM cards in every Omnipod 5 controller and by better aggregating and analyzing user level data, we can further enhance the customer experience for all stakeholders. With these investments, we can improve outcomes, lessen the burden for both physicians and users by providing actionable insight and develop more advanced future product offering. These innovations will serve as another driver to secure Omnipod as the user preferred brand and strengthen our digital health capabilities. 13:59 We have a sharp focus on our growing intellectual property as we create innovative new technologies and build on our strong existing patent portfolio. In 2021, we filed more new patent applications than in any previous year. This will help ensure we are well positioned to deliver on our mission and provide differentiated and industry leading innovation to people with diabetes for decades to come. 14:24 This past year, we built upon our 2020 expansion efforts and the rollout of Omnipod DASH across our international markets through targeted geographic expansion. We entered the Asia Pacific region through our entry into Australia and also expanded into Turkey. These efforts broadened access to Omnipod and strengthened our foundation for future growth. We expect additional market expansion in 2022 in the Middle East. 14:52 Our efforts to deliver Omnipod 5 to our international markets are underway. We are making great progress and I'm happy to share that we submitted for CE marking in Europe. AID adoption is accelerating, and while it presenting near term headwind, increasing market acceptance, reimbursement pathways and awareness of these technologies bode well for Omnipod 5 once we launch in our international markets. We look forward to Omnipod 5 being the product of choice globally. 15:24 Many additional people around the world would benefit from Omnipod and we are focused on bringing it to them over time. We are building our international teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. Diabetes is underserved everywhere in the world and entering new markets represents a critical long-term growth driver for Insulet. 15:47 Investing in our manufacturing operations also remains a strategic priority as we build upon our established global capabilities and scale. We made great progress in 2021, including additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing operations and to secure uninterrupted access to critical component creating a more resilient supply chain during these unprecedented times. We can produce 10s of millions of Pods a year and are extremely well positioned despite the challenging supply chain environment. 16:20 Our team continues to execute remarkably well successfully mitigating the impact on our business and on our customers. These efforts will support the full commercial release of Omnipod 5. The continued strong global demand we expect for Omnipod DASH and our growing innovation pipeline. Our growth plans in 2022 and the years ahead will not be constrained by capacity. 16:47 In closing, we finished another strong year and are extremely excited about 2022. We expect to fully launch Omnipod 5 this year in the U.S. We are advancing our strategy to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and we have an exciting and robust innovation roadmap. Our success is due to our talented team and their unwavering commitment to our mission. We have built an amazing company and an award winning culture. 17:17 This past year, we were named a great place to work in both the U.S. and the UK, while also separately being recognized as one of the Best Workplaces for Women. This past December, Druker's Institute listed Insulet as one of the top managed companies of 2021 based on customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. These recognitions in part because they come directly from employee and customer feedback are wonderful reminders of the power of our people and our positive impact on one another in our communities and on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. 17:58 I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. 35:33 Great. Thanks, Eric for the question. Yes, we are excited to be under active review for CE Mark. We don't really have a timeline to share beyond that as you may know, this is a new regulatory pathway, the Medical Device Regulation pathway and obviously a complex submission. We know that data looks great and we're very confident in the quality of the submission, but it could take some time for us to secure this approval. So, we haven't given guidance for timing. Just wanted to let everybody know that we are under active review and looking forward to getting that out onto the market. 36:12 In terms of what the limited market release will look like, we are still finalizing that strategy, it's very likely that we would enter into select markets as part of the limited market release and then expand from there, very similar to how we rolled out DASH in our international markets where we started with a handful of markets as part of the limited market release and then expanded from there. Thanks for the question. 37:22 Sure, Robbie. Maybe I'll start and then Wayde can speak to what's factored into the guidance for Q1. But it's just been a few weeks and the limited market release is progressing exactly as planned. I think feedback from those participating in it has been terrific and we're getting the early insights that we are looking for as we had said, what we're looking for is sort of testing our training pathways are onboarding our product experience, all while the team continues to build access. And so, so far so good, although it is early days, but we are encouraged. And as it relates to buying patterns, I think you would look at the fourth quarter in the U.S., which was very strong and ahead of our expectations and it doesn't -- it wouldn't indicate that people are waiting for Omnipod 5 just given how strong the quarter was. I'm sure there are people out there that are waiting for Omnipod 5 to get onto Omnipod, but certainly the performance in the fourth quarter would indicate that. 39:55 Three to nine. We haven't changed our estimate on that. That's what we've been saying all along. 40:19 Yeah. Thanks, Larry. So moving through to full market release is really dependent on just getting the number of days of use across our different customer journeys. So we have MDI users getting onboard, traditional tube pump users getting onboard, people coming from Omnipod and people who are coming from CGM or CGM naive. So we look across each of those and want to confirm the training pathways, we want to confirm the on-boarding pathways and of course, the product experience. So if all of that goes flawlessly, then we'll be at three months. If we learned some things in that that we want to address, then that may push us closer to six or nine months. 41:05 And while we're doing that, we're also working to build access. And so once we've got the customer experience, where we want it, and then we've got access where we want it, which we don't expect really to be a governing factor that's when will move into full market release. We just know there's going to be enthusiastic demand out there and we want to make sure we've got the best possible customer experience in best possible access position. And so I guess three months really would assume that we recruit everybody at the pace that we want to and that the experience is flawless and nine months would assume that we're learning some things that we want to address. 47:04 And Brandan just one note, although we are really excited to have them both under active review, the preschool expansion and international Omnipod 5 are not factored into our guidance. 48:12 Yeah, Jeff. It's such a good question because there is a lot of work in terms of market development and we talk about Europe or international as if it's one thing, but we all know, Europe is 20 for us, 20 plus different countries, different business models, different market registrations and different reimbursement pathways. The good news is we have that work underway. So we have teams who are doing the market development work today, but there will be work, depending on the market, some will go faster and some will go slower in terms of establishing coverage and access for Omnipod 5. So I can't really put a window on MDR. We are one of -- it's still early days for MDR, and so the pathway is just not that established. We're very confident in the submission. And we are under review, but it's one of the reasons why it's not built into guidance this year. It's just -- it's an unpredictable pathway at this point. We will let you know obviously as we make progress there. 49:12 And I would say we will move into a market release that looks -- limited market release that looks fairly similar to what we have in the U.S., just based on the need to do that remaining market development work in terms of establishing access and market registrations, et cetera, once we have CE Mark. 50:13 Great. Joanne, yeah, it's a very exciting pipeline, we've talked now today about preschoolers and the international launch, and of course, CGM integrations, Type 2 and iOS, so there is a lot going on very exciting. I think everything is progressing well. The work to integrate with G7 and with Libre has been underway for quite some time. And so that is making good progress there. Based on ICGM pathway and clearance for DexCom and G7 there should not be actually a regulatory submission. That's one of the beautiful things about the interoperable pathway. And so that should go relatively straightforward and the long pole in the tent there really is the technical work. 51:04 And right now, Libre may require likely to require a submission, that work is underway as well. We own those submission, so it's our responsibility to work with our partners to do the development work and get the regulatory clinical and technical support that we need and then those submissions would be ours to manage. 52:26 Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. And maybe I'll start with a limited market release question and then Brett can give some insight into the international market dynamics around AID. For the limited market release, what we're really looking to understand as Brett said, remember we don't lock our users into four-year agreements. And so that means that everybody who has market access and coverage and has access to Omnipod 5. So that's could be 10s of thousands, if not more than 100,000 users in the United States. And so we certainly want them to be able to get onto product, but we want them to be able to self-serve, so there are training pathways that are purely virtual for these different patient segments. 53:12 So if you are on Omnipod today and DexCom, you should not even need to meet with a clinician or a physician to be able to get onto the product, you need a prescription and to go through our training pathways. So that's an example of something that we want to test that pathway, make sure that everybody is satisfied and having a good experience and good success with the product after the training. And then there are a myriad of other patient pathways, the MDI user will have a different training pathway that does involve for example meeting with a physician and most of this is really focused on the user as opposed to the clinician, the product itself is incredibly simple, it's been designed to be as hands off as possible for the physician's office and to be very simple to use for the patient. So those are the types of things that we are testing and we just need to make sure that we get a good amount of patients across each of those patient pathways. 54:06 And then we have good feedback and confidence in the experience across each of those pathways, and then of course, we're building access in the background. But those are the types of things that we're looking to test. And then I'll ask Brett to take the second part of your question. 56:27 Sure, Matt. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We do -- we have had the iOS work underway for a while and there is no timeline update there, but I can tell you that the work is going well and we certainly are excited about it. Our plan has always been to take the learnings from our limited market release with our phone control on Android and factor those into the submission, and the launch plan for iOS. And so we do want to wait to get through that, before we would end up submitting, but right now, that's not the long pole in the tent, it's likely to be the completion of the technical work. This does require a 510(K) submission. So we are going to wrap up our technical work and then factor in any learnings from our limited market release with Android full phone control and then submit that for 510(K) clearance to the FDA. 58:06 Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I guess I would point to Q4 as an example or an illustration of the fact that I think people get the business model, right. What we are trying to avoid there is a slowdown before a new innovation launches and just helping educate clinicians and customers that they can get on the product and they'll be able to convert over to Omnipod 5 once their insurer covers the product. And I think the main focus there is to ensure that we don't see a step back as we bring new innovation to market and I think Q4 is illustrative of the fact that people get it and they're not delaying their choice to get on product as we get closer and closer to the launch of Omnipod 5. So I wouldn't necessarily look at it as an upside, but I think it's a great indication of the power of the business model that we don't slow down as we bring new innovation to market and that's very exciting. It's a great thing for patients and it's a great thing for Insulet. 66:36 Thank you, Dalam. I want to take a moment to share some of the unsolicited and wonderful feedback we've received from Omnipod 5 users during what has been just a few weeks of limited market release. Bethany, mother of a one-year-old shared a quote, Omnipod 5 has allowed me to be more present for my son, because I'm not constantly thinking about my own diabetes; and Kevin, father of a 16-year-old is a laided about how Omnipod 5 has changed their lives. He shared a quote today with the third morning in a row my son woke up with perfect blood sugar and no overnight lows. Omnipod 5 is a dream come true. And finally John, who has been on a pump for over two decades shared his lifetime of personal challenges and frustration managing has diabetes. In his words, quote diabetes has taken its toll on me mentally I bottled up and try to stay strong for my wife, my kids and those who love me I am tired. With Omnipod 5 I've slept through the night uninterrupted for the first time in a very long time. Thank you for all your hard work to make this dream a reality. So we cannot wait to bring Omnipod 5 and its unmatched benefits to the broader diabetes community. So that it can help millions of more people just like it's doing for Bethany, Kevin and John and their families. Thanks again for joining us today and have a great evening."

            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "41:45 Yeah, Larry. Its Bret. I'll just add that one of the reasons why it's important is, we want to move quickly at the full market release. And so some of the systems that we're testing during the LMR or the ordering process, the onboarding process, both of which provide tremendous amount of self-service for our users. Remember, we don't have a four-year lock-in period with our user base and so there's going to be a tremendous amount of demand from existing podders to move to Omnipod 5. We want them to be able to self-serve, and it's a self-start on the product and so the reason why those systems need to move go flawlessly as Shacey puts is so we can move really quickly and continue to focus on new starts during the FMR. 42:25 And so what we're testing those two parts of the system along with access as you mentioned, but access is going to be probably not the limiting factor to get to full market release, because we had a head start, we were said that we were ahead -- well ahead of where we were at with DASH before we launched that product. So access will probably be an acceptable level. And once we get comfortable with those two systems, the ordering and on-boarding process that will enable us to move really quickly during FMR. 46:00 Yeah. Thanks, Wayde. So I think once we get to Omnipod 5 what we really will have the most complete offering. We pointed to the lack of an AID system is being a headwind for us, not just internationally, but the U.S., but we've had these tailwinds of pharmacy Type 2 and DTC and in my mind, when we add AID now to the best form factor in the marketplace in Omnipod awareness becomes the next frontier for us. So we've already made tremendous strides in DTC, TV commercials, our learnings in converting those leads that come in to new starts have been tremendous. 46:40 And I look forward to the improved messaging in the addition of AID to Omnipod. That should be an enhancement to DTC at a better message and should drive even better conversion rates. So it's something we'll continue to do. We look forward to doing it throughout the year. And you'll see our message evolve as we approach the full market release of Omnipod 5 to include that AID message in those TV commercials. 54:20 Yeah. Hi, Danielle. Its Bret. For AID competition internationally I know it does appear that it's stronger than it was in the U.S., but a couple of things. One, we've had AID competition in the U.S. for about six years now. So it's just been something we've been living with and there are tailwinds in the U.S. that have helped us, it just don't exist to the same extent in our international markets and those are really three things, one is Type 2, remember with 35% to 40% of all of our new starts coming from Type 2 that doesn't exist internationally. And if so, if you were to take that out of the U.S. number you'd see significantly lower results with new starts, that's one. 55:02 The second is really the pharmacy lift. So both the pharmacy experience as well as the premium we get of pricing of Pods in the pharmacy channel, it helps our revenues in the U.S. And the third really is DTC that's been really significant for us over the last few years, it's been a significant spend. It's not really available to all of our markets outside the U.S. So that's something that -- although it's something we've tried in markets like Germany, Canada, it's not something we can do everywhere. And then, yeah, just that the pay-as-you-go models that really is the benefit, the pharmacy in the U.S. is something we're working on in our international markets, but just not to the extent that we have it today. So AID is new in our international markets. So it's a change and something that we're feeling today and we just got to work on those tailwinds, so that we have that list between now and when we launch Omnipod 5 to compete better internationally. 59:06 Yeah. Steve, this is Bret. Part of our message to both health care providers and patients is that, the quickest pathways Omnipod 5 is to be on DASH today because there is self-service training component for anybody that's on DASH. So the training doesn't become a bottleneck for anybody that wants to start on Omnipod 5 right away. The best thing they really can't do is start on DASH today go through the training, so that when Omnipod 5 comes out in a full market release fashion they're able to self-serve on that training and more quickly onboard with Omnipod 5. So that's the message that's resonating. Shacey [indiscernible] agree it's not really driving additional new starts, but it is preventing people from waiting, which is what we're trying to do. 61:15 Yeah, Matt. Hi. This is Bret. I can take that one. Our sales reps are compensated on new starts and new to Omnipod starts. So they're going to want to focus on really building our customer base and starting brand new users that are coming from MDI or from a tube pump conversion that are new to Omnipod. Those tools that we talked about both the ordering process and the on-boarding process should allow them to do that to focus solely on new starts. That is our intent. As we think about this pay-as-you-go model, this no upfront fee and patients will always be able to upgrade to the latest Omnipod technology, that's a good thing. And it's one of the reasons why we've been spending years now building these self-service tools in anticipation for the launch of Omnipod 5, so that we can innovate in short cycles and people will always be able to self-serve and upgrade to the latest version of Omnipod. And so that is our intent, it is one of the reasons why we've put this range on the LMR because we've got to test those system, so we've had people on product remember for over a year. We're pretty confident that Omnipod 5 is a fantastic product that people love it. These systems develop ordering and onboarding our new and we're testing this in the LMR because that is our intent, we want the sales and marketing teams to focus on new starts and we want existing partners to really quickly migrate to Omnipod 5 on their own."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Insulet\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both, the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2021 third quarter results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect outstanding execution by our Insulet team and momentum across our global business. We delivered 17% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. While we are experiencing headwinds related to the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, revenue growth was near the high end of our expectations. We achieved these strong results, thanks to our annuity model, which is a competitive differentiator that provides insulation from market disruption. We continue to achieve strong new customer additions, and we celebrated another record-setting quarter in the United States. We are seeing more impact from COVID internationally and expect this to continue over the short term. We are also seeing increasing preference for automated insulin delivery systems among people with type 1 diabetes, setting us up for an exciting launch of our first AID system, Omnipod 5. Until then, we expect these factors to affect our top line results in Q4 and for a portion of 2022. Nevertheless, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in Q4 of this year, including high-teens to low-20% for total Omnipod, with positive momentum entering 2022. Wayde will elaborate on this in his remarks. Our team has done a remarkable job navigating this dynamic time in the market, and 2021 will mark not only another year of strong revenue growth, but also tremendous advancement of our strategic priorities. Diabetes is becoming more prevalent, and pump penetration in both, the type 1 and type 2 markets is low. In fact, we believe the U.S. type 1 market can double over the coming years from its current penetration rate of approximately one-third. Additionally, the type 2 market with a U.S. penetration rate in the low single digits offers significant room for growth. We already see people with diabetes adopting technology at accelerated rates, driven by Pod therapy and automated insulin delivery. Internationally, both the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive markets are even less penetrated with sizable runways for expansion. We continue to disrupt the old market paradigm with a leading technology and differentiated business model that deliver an improved customer experience and improved outcomes. Our success in the type 1 and type 2 markets demonstrates the power of Omnipod and the value it delivers compared to MDI and legacy pump therapies. While not having a commercialized AID system presents some competitive headwinds in the near term, our performance without Omnipod 5 highlights the incredible growth opportunities that we will begin to unlock in 2022 and beyond. We expect AID adoption and our highly differentiated platform to provide years of exciting growth as we advance our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Our journey will take a major step forward with the expected upcoming FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which remains on track to occur later this quarter. As we recently shared, we submitted our responses to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information in September. We are pleased to have that part of the process complete and can\u2019t wait to bring Omnipod 5 to market, as we are confident it will be a transformative product for people living with diabetes. We are in the final stages of the review and our team is working closely with the FDA, who has been a great partner in the process. Advancing toward Omnipod 5 clearance is not the only strategic progress we made this quarter. We continue to drive growing Omnipod DASH coverage and volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and further penetrate the type 2 market, where we are uniquely positioned with our product innovation and differentiated business model. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a terrific solution for people living with type 2 insulin requiring diabetes, where today, we have established a leadership position. Additionally, we continue to amass compelling clinical evidence that supports Omnipod\u2019s many benefits. This includes impressive new Omnipod 5 data we shared in September at EASD. Taken together, we are on track to deliver another year of strong financial and operational performance and outstanding strategic progress. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Access and awareness both remain critically low throughout the global diabetes market, despite millions of newly diagnosed people each year. Awareness of advanced technologies like Omnipod needs to increase, especially awareness of its many benefits, such as its simplicity, discretion, improved quality of life and better outcomes. In addition, access to technology is still far too complicated. We have broken down barriers through our innovative pay-as-you-go business model in the U.S. pharmacy and raised awareness through our direct-to-consumer campaigns. We are pleased with the impact both efforts have had on improving access for many who require care. Even with our successes to date, however, many opportunities remain to improve access and awareness in order to empower more people with diabetes to live healthier, easier lives. In the United States, our pay-as-you-go business model in the pharmacy channel provides benefits for everyone. It\u2019s more efficient for Insulet and provides an improved experience and lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, with the vast majority paying less than $50 per month through the pharmacy. Additionally, it\u2019s easier for physicians to prescribe and offers numerous benefits to payers. In the third quarter, we expanded Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to over 80%, which in turn drove increased volume through the pharmacy channel. Payers are increasingly recognizing the economic benefits of offering Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. In the U.S., our new customer starts once again reflected the value Omnipod offers compared to MDI as well as our growing strength in the type 2 market. MDI conversions represented over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and the percentage that were type 2 remains in the 35% to 40% range, even with the strong new customer growth within the type 1 population. Our MDI conversion rate continues to trend upward as we successfully drive adoption among people living with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom come from MDI. In addition to expanding affordability, we are also driving access to Omnipod in a number of other ways in order to provide more options for people living with diabetes. We recently received FDA clearance for use of Lilly\u2019s Lyumjev with Omnipod. We are the only insulin pump manufacturer in the United States to obtain this indication, which we pursued to provide more alternatives and flexibility for customers. A key component of our awareness strategy remains our DTC advertising. Our efforts in the U.S. and select international markets continue to generate a highly positive response. The feedback has been enthusiastic and the increased awareness, interest and leads are contributing to our new customer growth. Our efforts are attracting MDI users and competitive pumpers as both base unmet needs that Omnipod helps address. Additionally, our DTC efforts are driving increased interest from individuals with type 2 diabetes as more primary care physicians learn about the benefits of Omnipod for this underserved population. So, DTC will remain a core component of our awareness efforts, and we are encouraged by the early results. We are a consumer-centric company and our innovation efforts are focused on delivering the best experience to our consumers. To that end, we are confident Omnipod 5 will mark an enormous step forward and drive accelerated adoption. Today, we offer a tubeless on-body experience that is unique compared to anything else in the market and an access model in the U.S. that has eliminated needless barriers and burdensome costs. The experience that Omnipod DASH provides is unparalleled, and Omnipod 5 will mark another breakthrough in diabetes care that builds upon our existing competitive advantages. Omnipod 5 will deliver groundbreaking technology first, including full compatible smartphone control with an algorithm residing on the Pod and SIM cards in each handheld controller. Omnipod 5 is a transformative innovation and will remain highly accessible and affordable through the pharmacy channel. It will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH, despite the increased value and advanced technology the system offers. In turn, we believe this will drive faster coverage of Omnipod 5, and we are already off to a great start. While we eagerly await Omnipod 5 clearance, our efforts to prepare for a successful launch have been moving at full speed, including securing coverage. Payers are generally reluctant to negotiate coverage terms prior to product clearance. However, given the excitement around Omnipod 5, we already have secured substantial coverage. We expect this head start on access to position us for a highly successful launch of Omnipod 5. We cannot wait to receive clearance as we know the incredible impact our advanced technology will have on people living with diabetes. The power of Omnipod is clearly demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we have shared over the course of 2021. One recent highlight was our new pivotal study extension results for Omnipod 5 presented at EASD. This study marked a total of one year of Omnipod 5 use in ages 6 through 70 years old. We were thrilled to find that the outstanding safety and improved glycemic outcomes first observed in the 3-month Omnipod 5 pivotal study were maintained over 12 months of home use. The data demonstrated the trifecta of insulin management, a sustained reduction in A1c; improved time and range; and minimal hypoglycemia. This long-term data demonstrates the durable benefits that Omnipod 5 offers. We are also close to submitting to the FDA our preschool expanded indication down to age two and expect to do so shortly following Omnipod 5 clearance. We continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, we advanced our type 2 clinical efforts and remain in the six-month extension phase of our Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study. The early data is very promising, and we expect to share the results at a future conference. Following clearance for Omnipod 5, we will begin discussions with the FDA on pivotal trial requirements for an expanded indication in this patient population. We are excited to be pioneers in bringing the benefits of automated insulin delivery to people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. In addition to Omnipod 5, we also presented results from our largest cohort study of people living with type 1 diabetes who use Omnipod DASH. Across approximately 4,800 people, the results demonstrated low time in hypoglycemia and a significant decrease in A1c after 90 days of use for children, adolescents and adults. For adults, the decrease in A1c was achieved while also demonstrating a 20% reduction in total daily dose of insulin used. As we build a portfolio of clinical evidence for our near-term innovations, we are also investing in the technologies required to position Omnipod for long-term growth. Our teams are diligently working on an iOS version of the Omnipod 5 mobile app, globalizing our AID system to bring it to international markets, and integrating Omnipod 5 with both Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom\u2019s G7. We\u2019re excited to continue collaborating with these two great partners and in time, offer CGM choice to our customers. We are also leveraging our significant digital capabilities to expand the ecosystem around Omnipod. Our Omnipod VIEW app was built for caregivers. Today, it allows caregivers of Omnipod DASH users to see real-time insulin data remotely. Omnipod 5 enhances the power of Omnipod VIEW because of the incorporation of SIM cards in every controller. SIM cards mean every user will have the unique experience of constant connectivity and being able to share real-time insulin and CGM data with caregivers and loved ones. SIM cards also mean no Omnipod 5 customer will need to manually upload data when visiting with his or her care team, thanks to cloud-to-cloud data transfer. Looking to the future, our algorithm and data science teams have already processed the data from our pivotal studies and type 2 feasibility study and are hard at work on our next-generation AID system. We believe we\u2019ve built a blockbuster with Omnipod 5, and we are excited to continue to innovate on the extraordinary technology platforms it provides us. Now, turning to global expansion, where we are growing our global addressable market across attractive international regions. Our international expansion unlocks the power of Omnipod for people across the world and will further increase our global addressable market beyond the 11 million to 12 million people we estimate are living with insulin-dependent diabetes throughout the global markets we currently serve. During the last 12 months, we expanded our global presence in seven new countries within Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. While it takes time for new markets to meaningfully contribute to our results given the nature of our business model, we see strong long-term growth potential through our growing presence in multiple regions. The work to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets is ongoing, and we are making great progress. Omnipod DASH has been a major global growth driver, and we believe adding our game-changing AID system to our product offering will further strengthen our competitive position across our international markets. Moving forward, we see a number of attractive opportunities to expand our global presence, to further penetrate our existing markets and to introduce advanced technology to underserved regions. We continue to assess many markets throughout the globe where we know people with diabetes can greatly benefit from Omnipod and where we are confident we can drive strong adoption and growth. Our near-term focus is on growing our global presence throughout the Middle East and Europe, and over the medium term, we plan to expand further within the Asia Pac region. Lastly, we continue to invest in our global manufacturing operations, which will further strengthen our production capabilities, efficiency and scale. Today, we are producing tens of millions of Pods a year and doing so at the highest quality. Our manufacturing expertise is a competitive advantage. And the investments we have made over the last several years to expand our operational excellence and establish redundant manufacturing capabilities while securing strong partnerships with key suppliers are critical. This positions us to support growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5, our international expansion and our innovation pipeline. It has also helped to mitigate global supply chain issues throughout the pandemic and represents an important long-term driver of sustainable revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In closing, we remain on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth and have made significant progress across each of our strategic imperatives. The clearance and limited market release of Omnipod 5 are just around the corner, and we could not be more excited for just how transformative this innovation will be for people living with diabetes. Our passionate and hard-working global team is our greatest strength. And we are focused on finishing the year strong and carrying the underlying momentum in our business into 2022 and well beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thank you, Shacey. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong financial performance and strategic progress. We generated strong new customer starts despite continuing to feel the pandemic\u2019s impact, which speaks to the durable power of Omnipod and our success driving expanded awareness and eliminating access barriers. We remain incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and what it can do for people living with diabetes. We generated 17% revenue growth in the third quarter, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. In Q3, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, within the range of our expectations. As a reminder, our Q3 growth rate benefited from the net impact of the estimated $4 million distributor channel destocking last year. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued in the third quarter, falling within our expected range. We continue to execute and drive strong top line growth and expect to finish the year with continued momentum. Also in Q3, we once again increased our volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and drove strong Omnipod DASH adoption globally among both, type 1 and type 2 customers. During Q3, Omnipod DASH drove 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 50% of our total U.S. volume. In Q3, international Omnipod revenue grew 14%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, Q3 growth was impacted by the estimated $4 million to $5 million of distributor channel stocking that we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. Today, all our new customers start on Omnipod DASH, which continues to drive adoption across our markets and our expanding customer base. That said, we continue to experience pandemic-related headwinds with a lagging revenue effect due to the compounding impact of our annuity model. During Q3, we saw the biggest impact from COVID in several of our international markets due to increased restrictions implemented in the first half of the year. As a result of the virtual training and onboarding capabilities we built at the start of 2020 as well as the team\u2019s adaptability and execution, we have successfully mitigated much of these short-term headwinds. Nevertheless, we will continue to feel the effects on our top line over the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect Omnipod DASH will drive continued solid adoption. We are seeing increased competition in some markets from AID systems. As Shacey mentioned, we are excited to advance our Omnipod 5 innovation efforts as we look to bring what we believe to be a transformative and unmatched AID system to all of our markets. The fundamentals of our international business remain strong, and we continue to grow our existing markets and expand our global footprint. We also continue to augment our team and capabilities to drive sustainable growth over the long term. I\u2019ll touch on our near-term expectations in a moment. Lastly, our estimated global attrition in the high single digits, and Pod utilization remained stable during Q3. While we saw a slight impact on attrition in a few international markets where AID systems have been launched, the changes are not material overall. Drug Delivery revenue declined 30% during the third quarter, finishing around the high end of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic. Gross margin was 68.5% in the third quarter, representing a 360 basis-point increase or a 330 basis-point increase on a constant currency basis. This performance was in line with our expectations. The primary drivers of our gross margin performance were our improved manufacturing operations and the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. These drivers were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in our robust innovation pipeline, our clinical initiatives, our commercial efforts to support the expected upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and also our continued international expansion. Operating margin was 12.2%, up 200 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%, up 210 basis points. Operating income was in line with our expectations as we invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity. We finished Q3 with $857 million in cash and short-term investments and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We\u2019re in a strong financial position with no near-term obligations, and we have opportunities to further invest across key areas of our business. We continue to take measured steps to strengthen our overall capital structure. As we noted on our second quarter call, we used the proceeds from our Term Loan B financing to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024. In July, an additional 5% of the outstanding balance was converted, which resulted in a $1.5 million loss on extinguishment during Q3 that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Also in July, we raised an additional $43 million of cash through an equipment financing, which further helps to reduce our overall cost of capital. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect 18% to 20% growth, including Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 20%. We now expect full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 22% to 24%, driven by increased access and awareness, our strong U.S. new customer starts throughout this year, the benefits of our annuity-based model and our growing volume in the type 1 and 2 markets and through the pharmacy channel. For international Omnipod, we now expect full year 2021 revenue growth in the range of 12% to 14%. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod DASH and expansion of our customer base continued to fuel our international growth. We expect the tailwinds in both our U.S. and international product lines will be partially offset by the lagging impact of the pandemic, which has a cumulative impact on our results as well as some competitive pressure from AID systems in the market. Lastly, we now expect revenue growth of 11% to 16% for Drug Delivery based on our partners\u2019 increased forecast. Turning to gross margin. Looking at Q4 specifically, we continue to expect a sequential decline, largely due to higher production costs as we ramp our automated manufacturing lines. While this causes some anticipated fluctuation in our quarter-to-quarter performance, we remain on track for full year gross margin in the range of 68% to 69%, likely closer to the low end of the range. Our gross margin performance represents a notable year-over-year increase and reflects both, our enhanced manufacturing capabilities as well as the benefits of our growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We continue to expect operating expenses for the full year to rise in line with revenue as we have been investing in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing and international expansion. We believe these investments are critical to sustaining the momentum in our business and building upon our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. The key drivers of our growth include our strong top line revenue growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect an approximate 100 basis-point improvement in our operating margin on an annual basis going forward. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2021 will slightly decrease from 2020 compared to our previous expectations of an increase, primarily due to timing. We continue to invest throughout our global manufacturing operations as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our fourth quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 19% to 25%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect Q4 revenue growth of 22% to 27%. The core drivers of this growth are the cumulative impact from our record new customer starts during 2021, the benefits of our annuity model and increased Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect Q4 international Omnipod revenue growth of 7% to 13%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption across our international markets. We expect the tailwinds in both product lines will be partially offset by the same headwinds mentioned for the full year guide. Lastly, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to increase 45% to 65%, based on our partner\u2019s current forecast. In conclusion, we are on track for another successful year as we continue to deliver solid financial performance and broad strategic progress. We\u2019re focusing on finishing the year strong and are excited for the expected upcoming clearance of Omnipod 5. We\u2019re investing in the critical areas of our business that will build on our current competitive advantages and drive further differentiation in the near and long term. There are significant growth opportunities ahead, and we remain well positioned to continue to drive meaningful value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dalam to open up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start with type 2. You guys mentioned a few updates on the call, specifically kind of on the algorithm side and trying to make progress on O5. So, I was curious what kind of pivotal study that -- what that pivotal study could look like. And then, as you think about the types of patients that could benefit from Omnipod and O5 specifically, would it be intensely managed, or could you actually kind of accelerate some of the efforts into other types of type 2s and why?\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Margaret, for the question. Yes. So, maybe I\u2019ll take us back a few months. If you remember, we shared really compelling data at ENDO back in March that demonstrated the impact of Omnipod 5 that it can have on people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And that data demonstrated -- early data, but it demonstrated more than a doubling of time and range from 27% to 59%. So, we do believe that the technology has tremendous potential to make a positive impact on outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. We are looking at the intensively managed group for this technology. And as -- one trend we see -- macro trend in the market that we see is that there is growing utilization of CGM among type 2 users, particularly intensively managed type 2 users. So, our belief is that as more CGM use happens, that will drive more seeking of these patients for tools to manage their disease, and that Omnipod 5 will be right there with the best wearable AID system for this population. In terms of what the pivotal study could look like, I think that\u2019s a great question. This is unchartered territory for people living with type 2 diabetes. And so, we are really proud to be doing the work to bring this technology to this population and to be pioneers. The feasibility data looks promising, and we still need to really have the discussion with the FDA on what a pivotal could look like. I think, we could see a lot of range here. It might be that we can use some real-world data because it\u2019s clear that there will be type 2 users of Omnipod 5 upon launch because of the access position that we\u2019re in or it could look like a full-blown pivotal like we did in the type 1 population. So, that will remain to be seen once we\u2019ve had the conversation with the FDA. And we\u2019ll certainly keep everybody posted because we do view this as a really exciting opportunity for that segment.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Wayde, I wanted to ask on U.S. and international Omnipod for fourth quarter. And I was hoping you could just sort of walk us through some of the puts and takes here. It looks like in the international market that the midpoint of the guide is down sequentially on a dollar basis. So, just wondering what would drive that. Are people using less Pods? I would imagine with the annuity model, if utilization was the same, it\u2019d probably increase. And then, also, in the U.S., you\u2019re still seeing record new patient starts. So, I was just sort of wondering what brought you down off the top end of the guidance range there, and walk us through some of the dynamics there. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure, Robbie. Yes, happy to. So overall, we\u2019re still holding the high end of our total company beginning of your guide at 20%. So, no change there. And we\u2019ve raised the low end up to 18%. So, we\u2019re 18% to 20% now for both, total company and total Omnipod. But, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve tightened the guidance ranges for each product line for the year, although still really strong growth, especially in the United States. So, what are we factoring in? We\u2019re factoring in the lagging impact of the pandemic as well as some competition from AID systems in the market, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So, overall, our Q4 guide is very strong. At the high end, it is our highest growth rate for the year for both, Omnipod and total company, with 17% to 22% for total Omnipod and then 19% to 25% for total company. As is our annual guide, it\u2019s still 18% to 20%, we keep an eye on the annual guide as we think about Q4 as well. So, despite some COVID-19 headwinds and the pandemic\u2019s impact on new customer starts last year that factored into the growth rate this year as well as the delayed clearance here for the launch of Omnipod 5, we\u2019re still at that high end for the full year. And if we hit the high end, we\u2019ll have now grown 20% for the last two years through COVID and with increasing AID competition here. So, a couple of specifics. Robbie, international down sequential at the midpoint. We don\u2019t really think about the midpoint. We factor in our total puts and takes, and it\u2019s sequential growth at the high end, sequential decline at the low end. One of the things we have to watch for internationally is some order patterns. We sell a lot of our products through distributors internationally, and sometimes there\u2019s order pattern, so we have to account for that in addition to the other factors I just mentioned. And in the U.S., again, we have the strongest guide for the year at 27% for Q4. And so, although we\u2019ve tightened the ranges somewhat, we\u2019re still looking at a very strong quarter for Q4.\nOperator: I show next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Apologies if I missed this, but my first question, Shacey, is for you on your confidence in Omnipod 5 approval by the end of the year. Just trying to push a little bit, make sure this isn\u2019t going to slip again. So, just curious, what gives you the confidence? Are we just waiting now for FDA, or have you had more back -- is there still more back and forth happening with FDA? And then, I have one quick follow-up.\nShacey Petrovic: Okay. Danielle, we may need your follow-up now or you might not fit it in. So, do you want to ask it now?\nDanielle Antalffy: Oh, sure. Sorry. So, just as you -- as it relates to the Omnipod 5 launch as well, I\u2019m curious if you guys think about what learning -- what you could learn early on in the launch, or do you think launching an integrated system is not going to be all that different from sort of how you\u2019ve launched the Omnipod in the past? Just curious if there\u2019s anything different about launching an integrated system versus launching just a standard Omnipod. And should we be thinking about this launch differently than sort of how you\u2019ve been present in the market in the past? And that\u2019s it for me.\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Okay. Thank you for your questions, Danielle. Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the one on Omnipod -- confidence in Omnipod 5, and then I\u2019ll let Bret just what we expect to learn with an integrated system launch. So, the interactions have been frequent and very collaborative with the FDA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, obviously, we had submitted the update to the app back in September. And since then, we\u2019ve had multiple back and forth with the FDA. And frankly, it\u2019s that back and forth that gives us the confidence that the system will be cleared before the end of the year. We are down to the final mile, and we\u2019re really appreciative of the FDA\u2019s responsiveness and engagement. It is a breakthrough device-designated technology, and it is a breakthrough device because of so much breakthrough technology in the system with full phone control, with the algorithm on the Pod. No one has ever done this before, including the FDA. And so, we are plowing new ground here, which we\u2019re excited about. But, we feel very confident in the quality of the submission and very positive about the interactions that we\u2019ve had with the FDA. And then, I would just say before I pass it off to Bret, the teams are doing a terrific job. Bret is leading a lot of this effort, just an outstanding job preparing for our limited market release. And that includes all of the testing of the training systems, the support, the benefits investigations, obviously, establishing coverage, which I spoke to, manufacturing the product, all of that stuff. So, we are ready to go and couldn\u2019t be more excited. And I\u2019ll let Bret answer your second question.\nBret Christensen: Yes. Hi Danielle, it\u2019s Bret. So, there\u2019s a lot that we can build upon from the learnings of DASH. And Shacey highlighted some of what we anticipate in the LMR. The reason we\u2019re doing the limited release is so we could test some of these things and establish access early. We\u2019re well ahead of the game on access and as well as the user experience, which is some of what I think you\u2019re getting out with the integrated systems. There\u2019s a lot to understand there. So, with the introduction of Omnipod 5, the onboarding experience will be unique and different from anything we\u2019ve ever done, which is part of what we\u2019ll be testing in the LMR. Some of that depends on their experience with both Dexcom and with Omnipod. And depending on their experience, each onboarding experience is unique to the individual. And in some cases, they\u2019ll be able to completely self-serve and onboard. And so, that\u2019s going to be really exciting. It\u2019s going to establish tremendous commercial scale for us, enable us to onboard many of our existing Podders that are so excited about Omnipod 5. And all of that -- the cooperation between Dexcom and Insulet on customer support will also be unique as we\u2019ve sort of worked through all, the different use cases and scenarios, where there\u2019ll be warm transfers going back and forth to different -- the companies depending on what the potential issue could be. But all of that stuff is -- when we talk about the customer experience is what we\u2019ll be testing in the limited release before we move to a full market release, but we\u2019re well prepared for all of those things.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Just, Shacey, one big-picture question on international. We\u2019ve seen it slow the last couple of years and the midpoint of the guidance is 13% this year. How should we think about international growth before Omnipod 5 launches outside the U.S.? And any color on whether that could start happening in 2022, or should we be thinking about international Omnipod 5 launch as more like 2023?\nShacey Petrovic: I think, our international business has been performing well, as Wayde said, in the face of some challenges related to COVID and some market dynamics around AID adoption. DASH has really been helping us to drive that growth. And I think, ultimately, we are seeing double-digit growth, despite the fact that the environment is changing in terms of CGM access, in terms of AID access and awareness. And so, that\u2019s great. We expect that to continue. We expect new patient adds to continue in our international markets. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re working so hard to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. We\u2019re not going to give a time line on that yet. We really wanted to wait to get Omnipod 5 into the market before we give guidance, so you can expect that sometime next year. But, I can tell you that the work is underway, fully committed to bringing our system to our global markets, and we will do that as quickly as we can. I think ultimately, these trends, while they present some near-term headwinds, they are very favorable trends for us, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we think about increasing awareness and adoption of AID in the U.S., as we think about increasing access for Dexcom\u2019s CGM and increasing access and adoption of AID in our international markets, that paves the way for a successful launch of Omnipod 5. So, while it presents some near-term challenges, really medium term, it should be a great trend for us.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Wayde, you\u2019ve mentioned the competitive impact of AID systems a couple of times. Every time you do, it seems like it\u2019s focused on the international market. So one, we\u2019ve got at least one of those AID systems here in the U.S., you\u2019re not mentioning it as much from a U.S. perspective. Is that just given the pharmacy access, the t2 access, things like that that\u2019s covering that up, or is there something specific in the international markets relative to the U.S. that is causing some of that issue, number one? And number two, Shacey, just to push on that OUS O5 time line and commentary you had. Regulatory-wise, what would you have to do? Can you use U.S. pivotal data to get a CE Mark and launch in Europe, maybe in Canada, things like that, or would you have to go through trials there that you haven\u2019t yet contemplated or started? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Hey Jeff, I can certainly start that. And I appreciate the question on this evolving dynamic that Shacey just highlighted, eventually becomes a positive for us. We do think the dynamic is different between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., certainly, we\u2019ve got AID systems to contend with. But, as you mentioned, we have done a great job with other significant growth drivers, DTC, our business model in the pharmacy channel with pay-as-you-go. Certainly, DASH has performed well in the U.S. So, we have a lot of momentum behind it. In international, we\u2019ve just launched DASH over the last year and have good momentum there, growing in the mid-teens internationally. But as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen a couple of countries start to see some more stronger AID competition. And as Shacey mentioned, as CGM adoption ramps, certainly, that brings AID systems with it. So, we do think the headwind is stronger internationally.\nShacey Petrovic: And Jeff, to your question regarding Omnipod 5 internationally, there is not a clinical trial requirement to get CE Mark to be able to sell and market Omnipod 5 in our international markets. It is a regulatory pathway, the MDR pathway that we will submit through for CE Mark. And there will be clinical work that is done to establish increased adoption and increased access and coverage of the technology, but we don\u2019t actually require any type of clinical to get clearance to be able to sell and market the technology in our international markets. So, the work that is underway is the technical work around translations, unit of measure, that stuff for the system, internationalizing the label and the system. And then, of course, we\u2019ve got some regulatory work and then some clinical commercial work really for more of the commercial elements of the launch.\nOperator: Thank you. I show next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMatt Taylor: So, I just want to ask one about international, just as a educational question. I mean, you talk a lot about pharmacy and pay-as-you-go in the U.S. And I just wanted to characterize how much of those types of channel and trialing advantages were translatable in the international markets, given they\u2019re heterogeneous and you have a different go-to-market strategy there. Could you talk a little bit about that?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Matt, it\u2019s such a great question. And so, I\u2019ll kick us off, and then I\u2019ll ask Bret to weigh in as well. So, I think it is -- most of the dynamics that are driving our success in the U.S., you highlighted them, pay-as-you-go and type 2, for example, those are opportunities outside of the U.S. It\u2019s just a matter of time. And as you know, the OUS markets are fragmented and complex. And so, it will be more fragmented in terms of how we deliver on those opportunities outside the U.S. And for type 2, there really is less coverage. One of the reasons why we\u2019ve had so much success in the United States in the pharmacy with type 2 is because of the differentiated access position. It is much easier to access Omnipod through the pharmacy than it is to access pump therapy through the DME channel. And so, that is what is fueling part of our growth and why we\u2019ve got 35% to 40% of our new starts type 2. The same value proposition exists in terms of the clinical impact, the improvement in A1c and the reduction in total daily dose of insulin. But we\u2019ve got more work to do clinically to demonstrate that healthcare economic argument outside of the U.S. and to establish reimbursement and coverage access really for type 2 outside of the U.S. And then, Bret, I know we\u2019ve had some progress on pay-as-you-Pod. If you want to talk a bit about that?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Sure. Matt, it\u2019s a great question, because the growth drivers today are a little bit different in the U.S. than they are internationally, but we see those as opportunities. And Shacey highlighted that we can move to pay-as-you-go, the pharmacy channel type 2. Those are related because remember, the reason why we have such great type 2 access in the U.S. is because we don\u2019t build that upfront fee. And so, pay-as-you-go really is more key than the pharmacy channel is. And we\u2019ll be looking at all of these opportunities internationally. But, certainly, we see lots of opportunity to move to a pay-as-you-go reimbursement model in the markets that we\u2019re in and in future markets. That could open up the door for type 2 access. We think that\u2019s a good start because when you don\u2019t charge that upfront fee, you eliminate that risk for the payers. So, all these things that are carrying us today in the U.S. that really make the growth rates different than they are internationally as headwinds are fairly similar. Those are all opportunities for us in the international markets.\nOperator: Thank you. I show next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Just curious, Wayde, if you could give a little more color on kind of what you\u2019re seeing with COVID vacations. And are you seeing staffing issues at ENDO offices? And a little color on kind of how you see some of the puts and takes on 2022? Obviously, Omnipod 5 is a big unknown at this point when that actually comes. But, just curious if you could give some puts and takes on next year, especially given some of the unusual seasonality we saw this year with COVID.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. And we\u2019re lucky enough to have Bret on. Bret, do you want to touch on what we\u2019re seeing internationally and around vacations and staffing and things? And then, I can pick up on some thoughts on 2022.\nBret Christensen: Yes, sure. I can touch on both of those. So, I guess, the vacations and staffing are both -- I think the staffing is actually more of a real issue within some of the endocrinology offices. And that becomes an issue for companies like ours, only if we rely on those staff to do some of the work for onboarding. And that\u2019s an effort that we\u2019ve had underway for a long time now to take that work away from healthcare providers, to do more of the trainings, to do more of the onboarding. And we believe that we are the easiest product to train and onboard on because of the ease of use of Omnipod. And so, we don\u2019t see that as a real headwind, although those are real issues for our customers and endocrinology offices, it\u2019s not slowing us down in any way.\nWayde McMillan: Great. And just picking up on 2022. So, regarding how we\u2019re thinking about our outlook there at this point, we don\u2019t issue formal 2022 guidance until Q4 call in February, per usual. However, happy to give you some of our thinking here. And we do think that we\u2019re in a good position to start strong again in the 15% to 20% range for total diabetes. It\u2019s a good place to start. We do have some differences between the regions given the different dynamics, some of them we\u2019ve talked about here. I think, we see U.S. Omnipod with really strong momentum. And we\u2019re thinking, again, it\u2019s probably high-teens, low-20s kind of a start to the year; international, more in the low double digits, at the lower end of that 15% to 20% or even below. So, it\u2019s looking like 15% to 20% for total Omnipod, which is strong growth off a growing base. And we have opportunities to exceed that, but certainly some risks to consider. For Drug Delivery, you can expect it to decline year-over-year, coming off a very strong year elevated by the pandemic here. So, overall, we\u2019re thinking about our total company revenue growth in the mid-teens. This can change as we close out Q4 and plan our official guidance here. But, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it today. Maybe some color on the U.S. Regarding U.S., we need to keep in mind that Omnipod 5 will be in a limited market release for some time and ramping during the year with access growing. And it takes time for our annuity model to build momentum and accelerate revenue. So, we\u2019ll get some benefit from Omnipod 5 in 2022, but there are many factors to determine how much. And we\u2019ll certainly provide updates as we go through the year. But, we won\u2019t see a full year impact from Omnipod 5 until 2023 and beyond. But, that really sets us up for multiple years of strong growth from there.\nShacey Petrovic: I think, Travis -- Wayde, that was very well articulated. Travis, I would just point out to what Wayde is saying that Omnipod 5 will be an accelerator. It\u2019s just a matter of when we can get into full market release in the U.S. and then when we can get it into market in our international markets. And obviously, the work is underway and the teams are very focused on making that happen. And then, as we look beyond 2022, we couldn\u2019t be more excited because we\u2019re launching what we think is going to be the most differentiated technology in the AID space. We see follow-on indications pretty rapidly with pediatrics. We see international expansion. We see iOS. And we see additional CGM integrations over the coming couple of years. And so, really exciting trajectory of innovation and growth over the next few years.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Geez, Wayde, after that last answer, I\u2019m kind of tempted to ask about 2023 guidance, but I won\u2019t. So, I have a couple of pharmacy questions. Pharmacy access, it\u2019s now near 50% of your U.S. volume. Can we assume that the majority of these folks will have access to Omnipod 5 upon launch? And then, my second question is for the other half of folks that are not accessing Omnipod through the pharmacy, it looks like two-thirds may have coverage but are not yet going through the pharmacy. I\u2019m just wondering, why are those folks not choosing to go through what seems like a better access point?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Hi Jayson, it\u2019s Bret. I can take those questions. So, I think what you\u2019re referencing is 50% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel. Our access is actually quite higher than that as DASH access is 80% now, which is -- the bulk of that is all in the pharmacy channel. So, very strong access in the pharmacy channel. And your question as to what we can expect at launch, we\u2019re well ahead of DASH at this time and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have any access with Omnipod 5 until we got clearance from the FDA. So, we\u2019re quite pleased with where we\u2019re at. The conversations with payers are going very nicely as we\u2019ve talked about AID systems, the pivotal data. And I think they\u2019re just waiting for clearance to start that process to contract and then add us to formulary. There\u2019s really no reason at all why we wouldn\u2019t expect Omnipod 5 access to very quickly reach the access that we have today with DASH in the pharmacy channel. So, it\u2019s just a process and a little bit of time. And then, your question about why wouldn\u2019t somebody start in the pharmacy channel, knowing that it\u2019s a better product and a better experience. While the vast majority of co-pays are less than $50 in the pharmacy channel, it doesn\u2019t mean all of them are. And in some cases, our legacy access is different than DASH. And so, there are situations, most probably access related why somebody may not choose to go into the pharmacy channel right upfront. And so, that access, we\u2019re continuing to get stronger and build every day, and that\u2019s why the percentage of new starts that are DASH into the pharmacy channel continues to rise.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCecilia Furlong: I wanted to ask about just the percentage of patients coming from MDI. It sounded like it ticked up slightly this quarter. But, just as you think about O5 launch going forward, how do you think about the ability of O5 to really expand pump utilization versus drive competitive conversions going forward relative to DASH?\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Cecilia. It\u2019s a great question. What we know is those percentages will change. It\u2019s a little hard to predict. But, when I think about Omnipod 5, I think about it as a additive growth driver. So, all the exciting growth that we\u2019re driving because of the pharmacy and because of type 2 adoption, which is primarily multiple daily injections today in the type 2 users, that will continue. We know we\u2019ve got a leadership position there and we have a differentiated technology for the type 2 user. But Omnipod 5 will be additive in terms of the growth eventually when we get into full market release and in terms of the patients that it\u2019s bringing in, and it should make us more competitive for those users that are choosing AID over pump therapy. And we know that that\u2019s the primary reason why somebody doesn\u2019t choose Omnipod when they come on to pump therapy. So, we would guess that our pump conversions will increase with the launch of Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks and congratulations on a good quarter. I have three quick ones. Just a quick update on DTC, continuing to see the TV ads, and so just wondering if there\u2019s any update on return on investment there on DTC? And what are the plans as you get into O5? And then, just on supply chain constraints, as we look into 2022, do you see any potential impacts to the working capital cycle as we get into next year?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Hi Anthony, I can start that one with an update on DTC. It continues to be a really strong growth driver for us in the U.S. We know that awareness is one of the problems we need to solve for, not just in the U.S. but internationally. And so, our spend has been pretty constant for DTC. We started this, remember, in September about a year ago, and it continues to be a real growth driver for us. We\u2019re getting better at it. We\u2019re getting better at converting leads into new starts. And we\u2019re getting really creative with our messaging, too. We launched different campaigns over the summer, called the Summer of Omnipod, which highlights the form factor of Omnipod, some of the benefits that we have and the freedom that Omnipod offers. We\u2019ve also dabbled a little bit internationally. So, we\u2019ve done -- run some TV commercials in the UK, some in Germany, some in Canada. And we\u2019re trying to learn the ROI in those specific countries, too, because we just see it as a really massive opportunity to increase awareness. And the ROI has been positive. I won\u2019t throw out any numbers there, but we know it\u2019s a good investment for us and something that you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to do.\nShacey Petrovic: And on the supply chain question, I can maybe start us off and then ask Wayde to comment about the impact on working capital. But, what I can tell you is that our teams are doing a marvelous job managing these dynamics. And to me, it highlights the value of the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last several years, not just in manufacturing redundancy but in supply chain redundancy. And that investment has really helped us to manage through some of the challenges that we\u2019ve seen in all environments, all industries in terms of the supply chain around freight, around certain components, et cetera. So, our team -- while we may have incurred some additional costs, they\u2019ve also done a terrific job offsetting those costs. And ultimately, there\u2019s been no impact at all to customer supply. So, that\u2019s a testament to how hard our teams are working to support the growth and also manage through these very real challenges that exist today.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. I could just add to the redundancy and supply chain improvements and investments that Shacey just talked about, we have been very successfully growing our inventory ahead of revenue. So, our inventories have grown significantly over the last year. We feel very good about that given where the -- where we were in the pandemic. Our teams did a fantastic job managing through that. We actually built inventory through the pandemic. And then, with the more recent supply chain challenges globally, team has done a really nice job managing that. And so, I think what you\u2019ll continue to see us do is continue to build capacity and build inventory ahead of our operational performance. And we do that to make sure we\u2019re in the best position possible to serve our customers and for new customers coming on board. So, I don\u2019t see a major change to our working capital cycle just given that we\u2019ve increased inventories so much to this point. But, you will see us continue to invest in a growing inventory number to make sure that we\u2019ve got more than ample supply for our existing customers and for our future growth plans.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDrew Stafford: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking questions. Congrats on the solid quarter here. I appreciate the color on next year. I just want to follow up a little bit so I can understand it better. Obviously, your U.S. business is growing 20% plus the last couple of years, even despite the pandemic in here that should fade a bit next year and then definitely some room on DASH penetration and, obviously, the O5 launch at some point next year. So, is the 15% to 20% really a function of your U.S. business more towards the higher end of that range and OUS more towards the lower, or is that more a function of your expecting that ramp of O5 to not kick off in a meaningful way to the business until more later in the year?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Drew, I can start that and then Bret may want to add some color as well. So, specific to the numbers, yes, 15% to 20%, I think you have it right in the sense that the U.S. will be at the high end of that range. We\u2019re calling it high-teens, low-20s just to give ourselves some room there. But, as you said, the U.S. has lots of momentum, and you\u2019ll certainly see low-20s in that range. And then, international at the other end of the guidance, as we said, low double digits because of the dynamics we\u2019ve just talked about on the call today. Although double-digit growth internationally still good growth, strong growth on the back of DASH, we don\u2019t have an AID system there, and we haven\u2019t announced when we will yet. And so, we always put a thoughtfully appropriate guide in place for the year. We think diabetes at 15% to 20% on what\u2019s now a $1 billion base of business is a good place to start. And again, we haven\u2019t given formal guidance yet, just trying to help people understand some of the major puts and takes heading into 2022. And then, as you mentioned, Omnipod 5, that has a lot of variability to it. We\u2019ve talked about here the limited market release and how long that takes. We\u2019ve said publicly before, it\u2019s usually a three to nine-month time frame. Depending on how fast that can be will dictate how fast we move to full market release. Access is also another gating factor. We\u2019re starting really strong in a good position here, but it may take some time to build enough access. So, there\u2019s just lots of things to consider around Omnipod 5. What we said is that we\u2019ll start somewhere in this range, and we\u2019ll update as we go through the year and as we progress with Omnipod 5. And so, I don\u2019t know, Bret, if you want to add anything else there?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Well said, Wayde. Drew, I would just say, your question is right. It really is a stronger U.S. growth next year that\u2019s really driven by the current growth drivers. So, DTC, our type 2 access, the pharmacy model, all those things will continue to drive the U.S. growth. We did build in some growth for Omnipod 5, as Wayde suggested. But again, with the annuity model, it takes a little bit of time. So, there\u2019s still some uncertainty of the length of the LMR, the time to get to full market release. And then, once we get to full market release, the annuity model doesn\u2019t really represent growth right away. It takes some time to build that into the rates and revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I really appreciate it. I\u2019m trying to get my head around something, which is when Omnipod 5 comes out, what does it do in terms of the portion of the market that you\u2019re most likely to address? And so, what I\u2019m also trying to do is cross-reference that with increasing new patient starts in type 2. Do you see your market splintering? Maybe splintering is a wrong word, or expanding? Or just help me understand when it arrives and as it arrives, what happens?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Joanne, I will start and perhaps Bret will have some additional thoughts to offer. But, we believe that Omnipod 5 will be additive to our growth. So, as you think about the momentum that exists today in our business, we\u2019ll focus on the U.S. because that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to launch first. There\u2019s a lot of momentum being driven today by DTC, so increasing awareness. There\u2019s a lot of momentum being driven today by type 2 users of DASH, the increasing use in the pharmacy, and then the benefits of the pharmacy for all users and then, of course, our differentiated form factor. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our growth today. All of that remains. And then, Omnipod 5 comes and is additive, and we believe will make us more compete in the type 1 space. And there is also likely to be type 2 users of the technology, although we will not market directly to them until we have an expanded label. But, we do think the technology has value there to offer. So, I think we know for all of the people that are coming out of MDI and on to pump therapy, the primary reason that someone doesn\u2019t choose Omnipod, which is clearly tests and market research to be a preferred form factor is AID. And with Omnipod 5, obviously, we check that box, and we believe we check that box with the very best system that will be on the market. And so, we think we get a lot more competitive, which is why I said earlier that the numbers will change, the ratios will change. Today, we get 80% of our users from multiple daily injections. We\u2019re going to continue to get those people, and we will get more. We will get more competitive switchers as a result of Omnipod 5.\nBret Christensen: Yes. I think, those 2 percentages that we often speak to 80% of our new starts coming from MDI and 40% of our new starts being type 2, I think we\u2019re okay with those percentages going down with the introduction of Omnipod 5, as long as new starts go up, which they will for sure. The other thing to think about, Joanne, as you know, all these tailwinds that we\u2019ve spoken about, that Shacey mentioned, are still going to be there with Omnipod 5, and we remove really one of the biggest headwinds that we have today, which is AID competition. So, Omnipod 5 does check all the boxes. It\u2019s why we think it\u2019s going to be a best-in-class product offering. And we\u2019re so excited about what it does to grow once we get to full market release.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nShacey Petrovic: Thank you, Dalam. And thanks, everyone, for your participation and questions today. As part of a company-wide event last week, we hosted several Omnipod users, including a few Omnipod 5 trial participants still using the system. And it was incredible to hear the impact Omnipod 5 has had on this diverse group of customers. Dwight, a grandfather living with late onset type 1 diabetes, said that because of Omnipod 5\u2019s simplicity, he truly trusted the system right away when he walked out of the clinic. Morgan, a young woman living with type 1 diabetes for 19 years, told us, \"Omnipod 5 is magic. It\u2019s unreal. I don\u2019t ever have to think about my diabetes. I want everyone to know about it. It has changed my life.\" And Valentino, a first generation American who has participated in other AID system trials said of Omnipod 5, \"All I can say is wow. I\u2019m waking up normal. I don\u2019t ever have to think about my diabetes. It brings peace.\" So, I want Dwight, Morgan, Valentino and others in the community to know that we hear you. We are working hard to get Omnipod 5 into your hands and to make sure that everybody knows about and can benefit from this remarkable technology. Thanks again for joining us today. And have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Shacey. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong financial performance and strategic progress. We generated strong new customer starts despite continuing to feel the pandemic's impact, which speaks to the durable power of Omnipod and our success driving expanded awareness and eliminating access barriers. We remain incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and what it can do for people living with diabetes. We generated 17% revenue growth in the third quarter, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. In Q3, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, within the range of our expectations. As a reminder, our Q3 growth rate benefited from the net impact of the estimated $4 million distributor channel destocking last year. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued in the third quarter, falling within our expected range. We continue to execute and drive strong top line growth and expect to finish the year with continued momentum. Also in Q3, we once again increased our volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and drove strong Omnipod DASH adoption globally among both, type 1 and type 2 customers. During Q3, Omnipod DASH drove 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 50% of our total U.S. volume. In Q3, international Omnipod revenue grew 14%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, Q3 growth was impacted by the estimated $4 million to $5 million of distributor channel stocking that we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. Today, all our new customers start on Omnipod DASH, which continues to drive adoption across our markets and our expanding customer base. That said, we continue to experience pandemic-related headwinds with a lagging revenue effect due to the compounding impact of our annuity model. During Q3, we saw the biggest impact from COVID in several of our international markets due to increased restrictions implemented in the first half of the year. As a result of the virtual training and onboarding capabilities we built at the start of 2020 as well as the team's adaptability and execution, we have successfully mitigated much of these short-term headwinds. Nevertheless, we will continue to feel the effects on our top line over the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect Omnipod DASH will drive continued solid adoption. We are seeing increased competition in some markets from AID systems. As Shacey mentioned, we are excited to advance our Omnipod 5 innovation efforts as we look to bring what we believe to be a transformative and unmatched AID system to all of our markets. The fundamentals of our international business remain strong, and we continue to grow our existing markets and expand our global footprint. We also continue to augment our team and capabilities to drive sustainable growth over the long term. I'll touch on our near-term expectations in a moment. Lastly, our estimated global attrition in the high single digits, and Pod utilization remained stable during Q3. While we saw a slight impact on attrition in a few international markets where AID systems have been launched, the changes are not material overall. Drug Delivery revenue declined 30% during the third quarter, finishing around the high end of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic. Gross margin was 68.5% in the third quarter, representing a 360 basis-point increase or a 330 basis-point increase on a constant currency basis. This performance was in line with our expectations. The primary drivers of our gross margin performance were our improved manufacturing operations and the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. These drivers were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in our robust innovation pipeline, our clinical initiatives, our commercial efforts to support the expected upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and also our continued international expansion. Operating margin was 12.2%, up 200 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%, up 210 basis points. Operating income was in line with our expectations as we invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity. We finished Q3 with $857 million in cash and short-term investments and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We're in a strong financial position with no near-term obligations, and we have opportunities to further invest across key areas of our business. We continue to take measured steps to strengthen our overall capital structure. As we noted on our second quarter call, we used the proceeds from our Term Loan B financing to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024. In July, an additional 5% of the outstanding balance was converted, which resulted in a $1.5 million loss on extinguishment during Q3 that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Also in July, we raised an additional $43 million of cash through an equipment financing, which further helps to reduce our overall cost of capital. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect 18% to 20% growth, including Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 20%. We now expect full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 22% to 24%, driven by increased access and awareness, our strong U.S. new customer starts throughout this year, the benefits of our annuity-based model and our growing volume in the type 1 and 2 markets and through the pharmacy channel. For international Omnipod, we now expect full year 2021 revenue growth in the range of 12% to 14%. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod DASH and expansion of our customer base continued to fuel our international growth. We expect the tailwinds in both our U.S. and international product lines will be partially offset by the lagging impact of the pandemic, which has a cumulative impact on our results as well as some competitive pressure from AID systems in the market. Lastly, we now expect revenue growth of 11% to 16% for Drug Delivery based on our partners' increased forecast. Turning to gross margin. Looking at Q4 specifically, we continue to expect a sequential decline, largely due to higher production costs as we ramp our automated manufacturing lines. While this causes some anticipated fluctuation in our quarter-to-quarter performance, we remain on track for full year gross margin in the range of 68% to 69%, likely closer to the low end of the range. Our gross margin performance represents a notable year-over-year increase and reflects both, our enhanced manufacturing capabilities as well as the benefits of our growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We continue to expect operating expenses for the full year to rise in line with revenue as we have been investing in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing and international expansion. We believe these investments are critical to sustaining the momentum in our business and building upon our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. The key drivers of our growth include our strong top line revenue growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect an approximate 100 basis-point improvement in our operating margin on an annual basis going forward. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2021 will slightly decrease from 2020 compared to our previous expectations of an increase, primarily due to timing. We continue to invest throughout our global manufacturing operations as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our fourth quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 19% to 25%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect Q4 revenue growth of 22% to 27%. The core drivers of this growth are the cumulative impact from our record new customer starts during 2021, the benefits of our annuity model and increased Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect Q4 international Omnipod revenue growth of 7% to 13%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption across our international markets. We expect the tailwinds in both product lines will be partially offset by the same headwinds mentioned for the full year guide. Lastly, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to increase 45% to 65%, based on our partner's current forecast. In conclusion, we are on track for another successful year as we continue to deliver solid financial performance and broad strategic progress. We're focusing on finishing the year strong and are excited for the expected upcoming clearance of Omnipod 5. We're investing in the critical areas of our business that will build on our current competitive advantages and drive further differentiation in the near and long term. There are significant growth opportunities ahead, and we remain well positioned to continue to drive meaningful value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dalam to open up for questions. Sure, Robbie. Yes, happy to. So overall, we're still holding the high end of our total company beginning of your guide at 20%. So, no change there. And we've raised the low end up to 18%. So, we're 18% to 20% now for both, total company and total Omnipod. But, as you mentioned, we've tightened the guidance ranges for each product line for the year, although still really strong growth, especially in the United States. So, what are we factoring in? We're factoring in the lagging impact of the pandemic as well as some competition from AID systems in the market, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So, overall, our Q4 guide is very strong. At the high end, it is our highest growth rate for the year for both, Omnipod and total company, with 17% to 22% for total Omnipod and then 19% to 25% for total company. As is our annual guide, it's still 18% to 20%, we keep an eye on the annual guide as we think about Q4 as well. So, despite some COVID-19 headwinds and the pandemic's impact on new customer starts last year that factored into the growth rate this year as well as the delayed clearance here for the launch of Omnipod 5, we're still at that high end for the full year. And if we hit the high end, we'll have now grown 20% for the last two years through COVID and with increasing AID competition here. So, a couple of specifics. Robbie, international down sequential at the midpoint. We don't really think about the midpoint. We factor in our total puts and takes, and it's sequential growth at the high end, sequential decline at the low end. One of the things we have to watch for internationally is some order patterns. We sell a lot of our products through distributors internationally, and sometimes there's order pattern, so we have to account for that in addition to the other factors I just mentioned. And in the U.S., again, we have the strongest guide for the year at 27% for Q4. And so, although we've tightened the ranges somewhat, we're still looking at a very strong quarter for Q4. Yes. Hey Jeff, I can certainly start that. And I appreciate the question on this evolving dynamic that Shacey just highlighted, eventually becomes a positive for us. We do think the dynamic is different between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., certainly, we've got AID systems to contend with. But, as you mentioned, we have done a great job with other significant growth drivers, DTC, our business model in the pharmacy channel with pay-as-you-go. Certainly, DASH has performed well in the U.S. So, we have a lot of momentum behind it. In international, we've just launched DASH over the last year and have good momentum there, growing in the mid-teens internationally. But as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen a couple of countries start to see some more stronger AID competition. And as Shacey mentioned, as CGM adoption ramps, certainly, that brings AID systems with it. So, we do think the headwind is stronger internationally. Sure. And we're lucky enough to have Bret on. Bret, do you want to touch on what we're seeing internationally and around vacations and staffing and things? And then, I can pick up on some thoughts on 2022. Great. And just picking up on 2022. So, regarding how we're thinking about our outlook there at this point, we don't issue formal 2022 guidance until Q4 call in February, per usual. However, happy to give you some of our thinking here. And we do think that we're in a good position to start strong again in the 15% to 20% range for total diabetes. It's a good place to start. We do have some differences between the regions given the different dynamics, some of them we've talked about here. I think, we see U.S. Omnipod with really strong momentum. And we're thinking, again, it's probably high-teens, low-20s kind of a start to the year; international, more in the low double digits, at the lower end of that 15% to 20% or even below. So, it's looking like 15% to 20% for total Omnipod, which is strong growth off a growing base. And we have opportunities to exceed that, but certainly some risks to consider. For Drug Delivery, you can expect it to decline year-over-year, coming off a very strong year elevated by the pandemic here. So, overall, we're thinking about our total company revenue growth in the mid-teens. This can change as we close out Q4 and plan our official guidance here. But, that's how we're thinking about it today. Maybe some color on the U.S. Regarding U.S., we need to keep in mind that Omnipod 5 will be in a limited market release for some time and ramping during the year with access growing. And it takes time for our annuity model to build momentum and accelerate revenue. So, we'll get some benefit from Omnipod 5 in 2022, but there are many factors to determine how much. And we'll certainly provide updates as we go through the year. But, we won't see a full year impact from Omnipod 5 until 2023 and beyond. But, that really sets us up for multiple years of strong growth from there. Yes. I could just add to the redundancy and supply chain improvements and investments that Shacey just talked about, we have been very successfully growing our inventory ahead of revenue. So, our inventories have grown significantly over the last year. We feel very good about that given where the -- where we were in the pandemic. Our teams did a fantastic job managing through that. We actually built inventory through the pandemic. And then, with the more recent supply chain challenges globally, team has done a really nice job managing that. And so, I think what you'll continue to see us do is continue to build capacity and build inventory ahead of our operational performance. And we do that to make sure we're in the best position possible to serve our customers and for new customers coming on board. So, I don't see a major change to our working capital cycle just given that we've increased inventories so much to this point. But, you will see us continue to invest in a growing inventory number to make sure that we've got more than ample supply for our existing customers and for our future growth plans. Yes. Drew, I can start that and then Bret may want to add some color as well. So, specific to the numbers, yes, 15% to 20%, I think you have it right in the sense that the U.S. will be at the high end of that range. We're calling it high-teens, low-20s just to give ourselves some room there. But, as you said, the U.S. has lots of momentum, and you'll certainly see low-20s in that range. And then, international at the other end of the guidance, as we said, low double digits because of the dynamics we've just talked about on the call today. Although double-digit growth internationally still good growth, strong growth on the back of DASH, we don't have an AID system there, and we haven't announced when we will yet. And so, we always put a thoughtfully appropriate guide in place for the year. We think diabetes at 15% to 20% on what's now a $1 billion base of business is a good place to start. And again, we haven't given formal guidance yet, just trying to help people understand some of the major puts and takes heading into 2022. And then, as you mentioned, Omnipod 5, that has a lot of variability to it. We've talked about here the limited market release and how long that takes. We've said publicly before, it's usually a three to nine-month time frame. Depending on how fast that can be will dictate how fast we move to full market release. Access is also another gating factor. We're starting really strong in a good position here, but it may take some time to build enough access. So, there's just lots of things to consider around Omnipod 5. What we said is that we'll start somewhere in this range, and we'll update as we go through the year and as we progress with Omnipod 5. And so, I don't know, Bret, if you want to add anything else there?"

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect outstanding execution by our Insulet team and momentum across our global business. We delivered 17% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. While we are experiencing headwinds related to the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, revenue growth was near the high end of our expectations. We achieved these strong results, thanks to our annuity model, which is a competitive differentiator that provides insulation from market disruption. We continue to achieve strong new customer additions, and we celebrated another record-setting quarter in the United States. We are seeing more impact from COVID internationally and expect this to continue over the short term. We are also seeing increasing preference for automated insulin delivery systems among people with type 1 diabetes, setting us up for an exciting launch of our first AID system, Omnipod 5. Until then, we expect these factors to affect our top line results in Q4 and for a portion of 2022. Nevertheless, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in Q4 of this year, including high-teens to low-20% for total Omnipod, with positive momentum entering 2022. Wayde will elaborate on this in his remarks. Our team has done a remarkable job navigating this dynamic time in the market, and 2021 will mark not only another year of strong revenue growth, but also tremendous advancement of our strategic priorities. Diabetes is becoming more prevalent, and pump penetration in both, the type 1 and type 2 markets is low. In fact, we believe the U.S. type 1 market can double over the coming years from its current penetration rate of approximately one-third. Additionally, the type 2 market with a U.S. penetration rate in the low single digits offers significant room for growth. We already see people with diabetes adopting technology at accelerated rates, driven by Pod therapy and automated insulin delivery. Internationally, both the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive markets are even less penetrated with sizable runways for expansion. We continue to disrupt the old market paradigm with a leading technology and differentiated business model that deliver an improved customer experience and improved outcomes. Our success in the type 1 and type 2 markets demonstrates the power of Omnipod and the value it delivers compared to MDI and legacy pump therapies. While not having a commercialized AID system presents some competitive headwinds in the near term, our performance without Omnipod 5 highlights the incredible growth opportunities that we will begin to unlock in 2022 and beyond. We expect AID adoption and our highly differentiated platform to provide years of exciting growth as we advance our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Our journey will take a major step forward with the expected upcoming FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which remains on track to occur later this quarter. As we recently shared, we submitted our responses to the FDA's request for additional information in September. We are pleased to have that part of the process complete and can't wait to bring Omnipod 5 to market, as we are confident it will be a transformative product for people living with diabetes. We are in the final stages of the review and our team is working closely with the FDA, who has been a great partner in the process. Advancing toward Omnipod 5 clearance is not the only strategic progress we made this quarter. We continue to drive growing Omnipod DASH coverage and volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and further penetrate the type 2 market, where we are uniquely positioned with our product innovation and differentiated business model. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a terrific solution for people living with type 2 insulin requiring diabetes, where today, we have established a leadership position. Additionally, we continue to amass compelling clinical evidence that supports Omnipod's many benefits. This includes impressive new Omnipod 5 data we shared in September at EASD. Taken together, we are on track to deliver another year of strong financial and operational performance and outstanding strategic progress. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Access and awareness both remain critically low throughout the global diabetes market, despite millions of newly diagnosed people each year. Awareness of advanced technologies like Omnipod needs to increase, especially awareness of its many benefits, such as its simplicity, discretion, improved quality of life and better outcomes. In addition, access to technology is still far too complicated. We have broken down barriers through our innovative pay-as-you-go business model in the U.S. pharmacy and raised awareness through our direct-to-consumer campaigns. We are pleased with the impact both efforts have had on improving access for many who require care. Even with our successes to date, however, many opportunities remain to improve access and awareness in order to empower more people with diabetes to live healthier, easier lives. In the United States, our pay-as-you-go business model in the pharmacy channel provides benefits for everyone. It's more efficient for Insulet and provides an improved experience and lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, with the vast majority paying less than $50 per month through the pharmacy. Additionally, it's easier for physicians to prescribe and offers numerous benefits to payers. In the third quarter, we expanded Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to over 80%, which in turn drove increased volume through the pharmacy channel. Payers are increasingly recognizing the economic benefits of offering Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. In the U.S., our new customer starts once again reflected the value Omnipod offers compared to MDI as well as our growing strength in the type 2 market. MDI conversions represented over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and the percentage that were type 2 remains in the 35% to 40% range, even with the strong new customer growth within the type 1 population. Our MDI conversion rate continues to trend upward as we successfully drive adoption among people living with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom come from MDI. In addition to expanding affordability, we are also driving access to Omnipod in a number of other ways in order to provide more options for people living with diabetes. We recently received FDA clearance for use of Lilly's Lyumjev with Omnipod. We are the only insulin pump manufacturer in the United States to obtain this indication, which we pursued to provide more alternatives and flexibility for customers. A key component of our awareness strategy remains our DTC advertising. Our efforts in the U.S. and select international markets continue to generate a highly positive response. The feedback has been enthusiastic and the increased awareness, interest and leads are contributing to our new customer growth. Our efforts are attracting MDI users and competitive pumpers as both base unmet needs that Omnipod helps address. Additionally, our DTC efforts are driving increased interest from individuals with type 2 diabetes as more primary care physicians learn about the benefits of Omnipod for this underserved population. So, DTC will remain a core component of our awareness efforts, and we are encouraged by the early results. We are a consumer-centric company and our innovation efforts are focused on delivering the best experience to our consumers. To that end, we are confident Omnipod 5 will mark an enormous step forward and drive accelerated adoption. Today, we offer a tubeless on-body experience that is unique compared to anything else in the market and an access model in the U.S. that has eliminated needless barriers and burdensome costs. The experience that Omnipod DASH provides is unparalleled, and Omnipod 5 will mark another breakthrough in diabetes care that builds upon our existing competitive advantages. Omnipod 5 will deliver groundbreaking technology first, including full compatible smartphone control with an algorithm residing on the Pod and SIM cards in each handheld controller. Omnipod 5 is a transformative innovation and will remain highly accessible and affordable through the pharmacy channel. It will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH, despite the increased value and advanced technology the system offers. In turn, we believe this will drive faster coverage of Omnipod 5, and we are already off to a great start. While we eagerly await Omnipod 5 clearance, our efforts to prepare for a successful launch have been moving at full speed, including securing coverage. Payers are generally reluctant to negotiate coverage terms prior to product clearance. However, given the excitement around Omnipod 5, we already have secured substantial coverage. We expect this head start on access to position us for a highly successful launch of Omnipod 5. We cannot wait to receive clearance as we know the incredible impact our advanced technology will have on people living with diabetes. The power of Omnipod is clearly demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we have shared over the course of 2021. One recent highlight was our new pivotal study extension results for Omnipod 5 presented at EASD. This study marked a total of one year of Omnipod 5 use in ages 6 through 70 years old. We were thrilled to find that the outstanding safety and improved glycemic outcomes first observed in the 3-month Omnipod 5 pivotal study were maintained over 12 months of home use. The data demonstrated the trifecta of insulin management, a sustained reduction in A1c; improved time and range; and minimal hypoglycemia. This long-term data demonstrates the durable benefits that Omnipod 5 offers. We are also close to submitting to the FDA our preschool expanded indication down to age two and expect to do so shortly following Omnipod 5 clearance. We continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, we advanced our type 2 clinical efforts and remain in the six-month extension phase of our Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study. The early data is very promising, and we expect to share the results at a future conference. Following clearance for Omnipod 5, we will begin discussions with the FDA on pivotal trial requirements for an expanded indication in this patient population. We are excited to be pioneers in bringing the benefits of automated insulin delivery to people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. In addition to Omnipod 5, we also presented results from our largest cohort study of people living with type 1 diabetes who use Omnipod DASH. Across approximately 4,800 people, the results demonstrated low time in hypoglycemia and a significant decrease in A1c after 90 days of use for children, adolescents and adults. For adults, the decrease in A1c was achieved while also demonstrating a 20% reduction in total daily dose of insulin used. As we build a portfolio of clinical evidence for our near-term innovations, we are also investing in the technologies required to position Omnipod for long-term growth. Our teams are diligently working on an iOS version of the Omnipod 5 mobile app, globalizing our AID system to bring it to international markets, and integrating Omnipod 5 with both Abbott's FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom's G7. We're excited to continue collaborating with these two great partners and in time, offer CGM choice to our customers. We are also leveraging our significant digital capabilities to expand the ecosystem around Omnipod. Our Omnipod VIEW app was built for caregivers. Today, it allows caregivers of Omnipod DASH users to see real-time insulin data remotely. Omnipod 5 enhances the power of Omnipod VIEW because of the incorporation of SIM cards in every controller. SIM cards mean every user will have the unique experience of constant connectivity and being able to share real-time insulin and CGM data with caregivers and loved ones. SIM cards also mean no Omnipod 5 customer will need to manually upload data when visiting with his or her care team, thanks to cloud-to-cloud data transfer. Looking to the future, our algorithm and data science teams have already processed the data from our pivotal studies and type 2 feasibility study and are hard at work on our next-generation AID system. We believe we've built a blockbuster with Omnipod 5, and we are excited to continue to innovate on the extraordinary technology platforms it provides us. Now, turning to global expansion, where we are growing our global addressable market across attractive international regions. Our international expansion unlocks the power of Omnipod for people across the world and will further increase our global addressable market beyond the 11 million to 12 million people we estimate are living with insulin-dependent diabetes throughout the global markets we currently serve. During the last 12 months, we expanded our global presence in seven new countries within Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. While it takes time for new markets to meaningfully contribute to our results given the nature of our business model, we see strong long-term growth potential through our growing presence in multiple regions. The work to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets is ongoing, and we are making great progress. Omnipod DASH has been a major global growth driver, and we believe adding our game-changing AID system to our product offering will further strengthen our competitive position across our international markets. Moving forward, we see a number of attractive opportunities to expand our global presence, to further penetrate our existing markets and to introduce advanced technology to underserved regions. We continue to assess many markets throughout the globe where we know people with diabetes can greatly benefit from Omnipod and where we are confident we can drive strong adoption and growth. Our near-term focus is on growing our global presence throughout the Middle East and Europe, and over the medium term, we plan to expand further within the Asia Pac region. Lastly, we continue to invest in our global manufacturing operations, which will further strengthen our production capabilities, efficiency and scale. Today, we are producing tens of millions of Pods a year and doing so at the highest quality. Our manufacturing expertise is a competitive advantage. And the investments we have made over the last several years to expand our operational excellence and establish redundant manufacturing capabilities while securing strong partnerships with key suppliers are critical. This positions us to support growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5, our international expansion and our innovation pipeline. It has also helped to mitigate global supply chain issues throughout the pandemic and represents an important long-term driver of sustainable revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In closing, we remain on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth and have made significant progress across each of our strategic imperatives. The clearance and limited market release of Omnipod 5 are just around the corner, and we could not be more excited for just how transformative this innovation will be for people living with diabetes. Our passionate and hard-working global team is our greatest strength. And we are focused on finishing the year strong and carrying the underlying momentum in our business into 2022 and well beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Thanks, Margaret, for the question. Yes. So, maybe I'll take us back a few months. If you remember, we shared really compelling data at ENDO back in March that demonstrated the impact of Omnipod 5 that it can have on people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And that data demonstrated -- early data, but it demonstrated more than a doubling of time and range from 27% to 59%. So, we do believe that the technology has tremendous potential to make a positive impact on outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. We are looking at the intensively managed group for this technology. And as -- one trend we see -- macro trend in the market that we see is that there is growing utilization of CGM among type 2 users, particularly intensively managed type 2 users. So, our belief is that as more CGM use happens, that will drive more seeking of these patients for tools to manage their disease, and that Omnipod 5 will be right there with the best wearable AID system for this population. In terms of what the pivotal study could look like, I think that's a great question. This is unchartered territory for people living with type 2 diabetes. And so, we are really proud to be doing the work to bring this technology to this population and to be pioneers. The feasibility data looks promising, and we still need to really have the discussion with the FDA on what a pivotal could look like. I think, we could see a lot of range here. It might be that we can use some real-world data because it's clear that there will be type 2 users of Omnipod 5 upon launch because of the access position that we're in or it could look like a full-blown pivotal like we did in the type 1 population. So, that will remain to be seen once we've had the conversation with the FDA. And we'll certainly keep everybody posted because we do view this as a really exciting opportunity for that segment. Okay. Danielle, we may need your follow-up now or you might not fit it in. So, do you want to ask it now? Great. Okay. Thank you for your questions, Danielle. Yes. So, I'll take the one on Omnipod -- confidence in Omnipod 5, and then I'll let Bret just what we expect to learn with an integrated system launch. So, the interactions have been frequent and very collaborative with the FDA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, obviously, we had submitted the update to the app back in September. And since then, we've had multiple back and forth with the FDA. And frankly, it's that back and forth that gives us the confidence that the system will be cleared before the end of the year. We are down to the final mile, and we're really appreciative of the FDA's responsiveness and engagement. It is a breakthrough device-designated technology, and it is a breakthrough device because of so much breakthrough technology in the system with full phone control, with the algorithm on the Pod. No one has ever done this before, including the FDA. And so, we are plowing new ground here, which we're excited about. But, we feel very confident in the quality of the submission and very positive about the interactions that we've had with the FDA. And then, I would just say before I pass it off to Bret, the teams are doing a terrific job. Bret is leading a lot of this effort, just an outstanding job preparing for our limited market release. And that includes all of the testing of the training systems, the support, the benefits investigations, obviously, establishing coverage, which I spoke to, manufacturing the product, all of that stuff. So, we are ready to go and couldn't be more excited. And I'll let Bret answer your second question. I think, our international business has been performing well, as Wayde said, in the face of some challenges related to COVID and some market dynamics around AID adoption. DASH has really been helping us to drive that growth. And I think, ultimately, we are seeing double-digit growth, despite the fact that the environment is changing in terms of CGM access, in terms of AID access and awareness. And so, that's great. We expect that to continue. We expect new patient adds to continue in our international markets. And it's one of the reasons why we're working so hard to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. We're not going to give a time line on that yet. We really wanted to wait to get Omnipod 5 into the market before we give guidance, so you can expect that sometime next year. But, I can tell you that the work is underway, fully committed to bringing our system to our global markets, and we will do that as quickly as we can. I think ultimately, these trends, while they present some near-term headwinds, they are very favorable trends for us, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we think about increasing awareness and adoption of AID in the U.S., as we think about increasing access for Dexcom's CGM and increasing access and adoption of AID in our international markets, that paves the way for a successful launch of Omnipod 5. So, while it presents some near-term challenges, really medium term, it should be a great trend for us. And Jeff, to your question regarding Omnipod 5 internationally, there is not a clinical trial requirement to get CE Mark to be able to sell and market Omnipod 5 in our international markets. It is a regulatory pathway, the MDR pathway that we will submit through for CE Mark. And there will be clinical work that is done to establish increased adoption and increased access and coverage of the technology, but we don't actually require any type of clinical to get clearance to be able to sell and market the technology in our international markets. So, the work that is underway is the technical work around translations, unit of measure, that stuff for the system, internationalizing the label and the system. And then, of course, we've got some regulatory work and then some clinical commercial work really for more of the commercial elements of the launch. Yes. Matt, it's such a great question. And so, I'll kick us off, and then I'll ask Bret to weigh in as well. So, I think it is -- most of the dynamics that are driving our success in the U.S., you highlighted them, pay-as-you-go and type 2, for example, those are opportunities outside of the U.S. It's just a matter of time. And as you know, the OUS markets are fragmented and complex. And so, it will be more fragmented in terms of how we deliver on those opportunities outside the U.S. And for type 2, there really is less coverage. One of the reasons why we've had so much success in the United States in the pharmacy with type 2 is because of the differentiated access position. It is much easier to access Omnipod through the pharmacy than it is to access pump therapy through the DME channel. And so, that is what is fueling part of our growth and why we've got 35% to 40% of our new starts type 2. The same value proposition exists in terms of the clinical impact, the improvement in A1c and the reduction in total daily dose of insulin. But we've got more work to do clinically to demonstrate that healthcare economic argument outside of the U.S. and to establish reimbursement and coverage access really for type 2 outside of the U.S. And then, Bret, I know we've had some progress on pay-as-you-Pod. If you want to talk a bit about that? I think, Travis -- Wayde, that was very well articulated. Travis, I would just point out to what Wayde is saying that Omnipod 5 will be an accelerator. It's just a matter of when we can get into full market release in the U.S. and then when we can get it into market in our international markets. And obviously, the work is underway and the teams are very focused on making that happen. And then, as we look beyond 2022, we couldn't be more excited because we're launching what we think is going to be the most differentiated technology in the AID space. We see follow-on indications pretty rapidly with pediatrics. We see international expansion. We see iOS. And we see additional CGM integrations over the coming couple of years. And so, really exciting trajectory of innovation and growth over the next few years. Thanks, Cecilia. It's a great question. What we know is those percentages will change. It's a little hard to predict. But, when I think about Omnipod 5, I think about it as a additive growth driver. So, all the exciting growth that we're driving because of the pharmacy and because of type 2 adoption, which is primarily multiple daily injections today in the type 2 users, that will continue. We know we've got a leadership position there and we have a differentiated technology for the type 2 user. But Omnipod 5 will be additive in terms of the growth eventually when we get into full market release and in terms of the patients that it's bringing in, and it should make us more competitive for those users that are choosing AID over pump therapy. And we know that that's the primary reason why somebody doesn't choose Omnipod when they come on to pump therapy. So, we would guess that our pump conversions will increase with the launch of Omnipod 5. And on the supply chain question, I can maybe start us off and then ask Wayde to comment about the impact on working capital. But, what I can tell you is that our teams are doing a marvelous job managing these dynamics. And to me, it highlights the value of the investment that we've made over the last several years, not just in manufacturing redundancy but in supply chain redundancy. And that investment has really helped us to manage through some of the challenges that we've seen in all environments, all industries in terms of the supply chain around freight, around certain components, et cetera. So, our team -- while we may have incurred some additional costs, they've also done a terrific job offsetting those costs. And ultimately, there's been no impact at all to customer supply. So, that's a testament to how hard our teams are working to support the growth and also manage through these very real challenges that exist today. Sure. Joanne, I will start and perhaps Bret will have some additional thoughts to offer. But, we believe that Omnipod 5 will be additive to our growth. So, as you think about the momentum that exists today in our business, we'll focus on the U.S. because that's where we're going to launch first. There's a lot of momentum being driven today by DTC, so increasing awareness. There's a lot of momentum being driven today by type 2 users of DASH, the increasing use in the pharmacy, and then the benefits of the pharmacy for all users and then, of course, our differentiated form factor. And that's what's driving our growth today. All of that remains. And then, Omnipod 5 comes and is additive, and we believe will make us more compete in the type 1 space. And there is also likely to be type 2 users of the technology, although we will not market directly to them until we have an expanded label. But, we do think the technology has value there to offer. So, I think we know for all of the people that are coming out of MDI and on to pump therapy, the primary reason that someone doesn't choose Omnipod, which is clearly tests and market research to be a preferred form factor is AID. And with Omnipod 5, obviously, we check that box, and we believe we check that box with the very best system that will be on the market. And so, we think we get a lot more competitive, which is why I said earlier that the numbers will change, the ratios will change. Today, we get 80% of our users from multiple daily injections. We're going to continue to get those people, and we will get more. We will get more competitive switchers as a result of Omnipod 5. Thank you, Dalam. And thanks, everyone, for your participation and questions today. As part of a company-wide event last week, we hosted several Omnipod users, including a few Omnipod 5 trial participants still using the system. And it was incredible to hear the impact Omnipod 5 has had on this diverse group of customers. Dwight, a grandfather living with late onset type 1 diabetes, said that because of Omnipod 5's simplicity, he truly trusted the system right away when he walked out of the clinic. Morgan, a young woman living with type 1 diabetes for 19 years, told us, \"Omnipod 5 is magic. It's unreal. I don't ever have to think about my diabetes. I want everyone to know about it. It has changed my life.\" And Valentino, a first generation American who has participated in other AID system trials said of Omnipod 5, \"All I can say is wow. I'm waking up normal. I don't ever have to think about my diabetes. It brings peace.\" So, I want Dwight, Morgan, Valentino and others in the community to know that we hear you. We are working hard to get Omnipod 5 into your hands and to make sure that everybody knows about and can benefit from this remarkable technology. Thanks again for joining us today. And have a great evening."

            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "Yes. Hi Danielle, it's Bret. So, there's a lot that we can build upon from the learnings of DASH. And Shacey highlighted some of what we anticipate in the LMR. The reason we're doing the limited release is so we could test some of these things and establish access early. We're well ahead of the game on access and as well as the user experience, which is some of what I think you're getting out with the integrated systems. There's a lot to understand there. So, with the introduction of Omnipod 5, the onboarding experience will be unique and different from anything we've ever done, which is part of what we'll be testing in the LMR. Some of that depends on their experience with both Dexcom and with Omnipod. And depending on their experience, each onboarding experience is unique to the individual. And in some cases, they'll be able to completely self-serve and onboard. And so, that's going to be really exciting. It's going to establish tremendous commercial scale for us, enable us to onboard many of our existing Podders that are so excited about Omnipod 5. And all of that -- the cooperation between Dexcom and Insulet on customer support will also be unique as we've sort of worked through all, the different use cases and scenarios, where there'll be warm transfers going back and forth to different -- the companies depending on what the potential issue could be. But all of that stuff is -- when we talk about the customer experience is what we'll be testing in the limited release before we move to a full market release, but we're well prepared for all of those things. Yes. Sure. Matt, it's a great question, because the growth drivers today are a little bit different in the U.S. than they are internationally, but we see those as opportunities. And Shacey highlighted that we can move to pay-as-you-go, the pharmacy channel type 2. Those are related because remember, the reason why we have such great type 2 access in the U.S. is because we don't build that upfront fee. And so, pay-as-you-go really is more key than the pharmacy channel is. And we'll be looking at all of these opportunities internationally. But, certainly, we see lots of opportunity to move to a pay-as-you-go reimbursement model in the markets that we're in and in future markets. That could open up the door for type 2 access. We think that's a good start because when you don't charge that upfront fee, you eliminate that risk for the payers. So, all these things that are carrying us today in the U.S. that really make the growth rates different than they are internationally as headwinds are fairly similar. Those are all opportunities for us in the international markets. Yes, sure. I can touch on both of those. So, I guess, the vacations and staffing are both -- I think the staffing is actually more of a real issue within some of the endocrinology offices. And that becomes an issue for companies like ours, only if we rely on those staff to do some of the work for onboarding. And that's an effort that we've had underway for a long time now to take that work away from healthcare providers, to do more of the trainings, to do more of the onboarding. And we believe that we are the easiest product to train and onboard on because of the ease of use of Omnipod. And so, we don't see that as a real headwind, although those are real issues for our customers and endocrinology offices, it's not slowing us down in any way. Yes. Hi Jayson, it's Bret. I can take those questions. So, I think what you're referencing is 50% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel. Our access is actually quite higher than that as DASH access is 80% now, which is -- the bulk of that is all in the pharmacy channel. So, very strong access in the pharmacy channel. And your question as to what we can expect at launch, we're well ahead of DASH at this time and didn't think we'd have any access with Omnipod 5 until we got clearance from the FDA. So, we're quite pleased with where we're at. The conversations with payers are going very nicely as we've talked about AID systems, the pivotal data. And I think they're just waiting for clearance to start that process to contract and then add us to formulary. There's really no reason at all why we wouldn't expect Omnipod 5 access to very quickly reach the access that we have today with DASH in the pharmacy channel. So, it's just a process and a little bit of time. And then, your question about why wouldn't somebody start in the pharmacy channel, knowing that it's a better product and a better experience. While the vast majority of co-pays are less than $50 in the pharmacy channel, it doesn't mean all of them are. And in some cases, our legacy access is different than DASH. And so, there are situations, most probably access related why somebody may not choose to go into the pharmacy channel right upfront. And so, that access, we're continuing to get stronger and build every day, and that's why the percentage of new starts that are DASH into the pharmacy channel continues to rise. Yes. Hi Anthony, I can start that one with an update on DTC. It continues to be a really strong growth driver for us in the U.S. We know that awareness is one of the problems we need to solve for, not just in the U.S. but internationally. And so, our spend has been pretty constant for DTC. We started this, remember, in September about a year ago, and it continues to be a real growth driver for us. We're getting better at it. We're getting better at converting leads into new starts. And we're getting really creative with our messaging, too. We launched different campaigns over the summer, called the Summer of Omnipod, which highlights the form factor of Omnipod, some of the benefits that we have and the freedom that Omnipod offers. We've also dabbled a little bit internationally. So, we've done -- run some TV commercials in the UK, some in Germany, some in Canada. And we're trying to learn the ROI in those specific countries, too, because we just see it as a really massive opportunity to increase awareness. And the ROI has been positive. I won't throw out any numbers there, but we know it's a good investment for us and something that you can expect that we'll continue to do. Yes. Well said, Wayde. Drew, I would just say, your question is right. It really is a stronger U.S. growth next year that's really driven by the current growth drivers. So, DTC, our type 2 access, the pharmacy model, all those things will continue to drive the U.S. growth. We did build in some growth for Omnipod 5, as Wayde suggested. But again, with the annuity model, it takes a little bit of time. So, there's still some uncertainty of the length of the LMR, the time to get to full market release. And then, once we get to full market release, the annuity model doesn't really represent growth right away. It takes some time to build that into the rates and revenue. Yes. I think, those 2 percentages that we often speak to 80% of our new starts coming from MDI and 40% of our new starts being type 2, I think we're okay with those percentages going down with the introduction of Omnipod 5, as long as new starts go up, which they will for sure. The other thing to think about, Joanne, as you know, all these tailwinds that we've spoken about, that Shacey mentioned, are still going to be there with Omnipod 5, and we remove really one of the biggest headwinds that we have today, which is AID competition. So, Omnipod 5 does check all the boxes. It's why we think it's going to be a best-in-class product offering. And we're so excited about what it does to grow once we get to full market release."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President and Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our second quarter 2021 results and full year 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We have reached the midpoint of the year and continue to deliver solid financial and operational performance and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. We\u2019ve maintained sharp focus on executing our strategy and driving growth and have sustained momentum across our business. Our outlook is also strong and we are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, including meaningful acceleration during the second half. During the second quarter, we achieved 13% revenue growth, including total Omnipod growth of 16%. Our results met our expectations despite a headwind from higher-than-anticipated rebate adjustments in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Absent these, we drove revenue results both in terms of volume growth and mix benefit that exceeded our expectations. We also achieved another quarterly record of U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts, which gives us great confidence and enthusiasm for Insulet\u2019s future. While our team remains squarely focused on Omnipod 5 clearance efforts, we made terrific progress across each of our strategic imperatives. We expanded coverage and volume growth of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy, drove continued adoption in the Type 2 market where we are uniquely positioned, once again drove strong MDI conversions and presented compelling clinical data at the ATTD and ADA conferences. These accomplishments demonstrate both the success we\u2019re having unlocking the Type 2 market with our innovative product and business model, and the acceleration we expect in the Type 1 market with the launch of Omnipod 5. We have delivered consistently strong performance in these critical areas without an automated insulin delivery system in the market, which speaks to the power of Omnipod, the unique advantages of our pay-as-you-go business model and the differentiated customer experience we provide. Regarding our Omnipod 5 AID system, we are in the final stages of the FDA review process and are incredibly appreciative of the agency\u2019s diligence and collaboration, particularly given the pandemic workload. While we continue to expect FDA clearance and limited market release in the second half of 2021, we believe Q3 clearance is unlikely and now estimate that both will happen later in the fourth quarter. We remain incredibly excited about what Omnipod 5 will offer the diabetes community. Our market position, which is already strong, will be greatly enhanced by the introduction of Omnipod 5. We are well prepared, have invested in our sales teams, expanded our manufacturing capacity and made great progress securing payer support. Our efforts in these areas will continue as we work through the final stages of the clearance process. We are confident in a successful launch of Omnipod 5, and I will share more on that in a few minutes. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Beginning with access and awareness, the global diabetes market is growing rapidly, with millions of people expected to be newly diagnosed this year alone and rapid adoption of CGM among people living with Type 1 diabetes and more recently, Type 2 diabetes. Despite such a large and fast growing market, it remains critically underserved, and awareness of and access to technology remain far too low. We continue to expand access and utilization through the pharmacy, which provides a better customer experience, a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet. In the second quarter, we grew Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to approximately 80%, a sizable sequential increase. This drove a notable increase of U.S. volume through the pharmacy in Q2. Omnipod DASH continues to be our primary growth driver, with the majority of our new customers across the globe starting on this system. Approximately 80% of our U.S. new customer starts are consistently driven by MDI conversions, and a percentage of our U.S. new customers that were Type 2 during the second quarter remained strong at 35% to 40%, even with the record-setting growth in new customer starts. In the Type 1 segment, historically large numbers of MDI users are adopting technology, which gives us continued confidence that AID will drive a doubling of the pump market in the coming years. We are pleased with our current growth in Type 1, which is a testament to Omnipod\u2019s differentiation. And as we look ahead to Omnipod 5, we expect to be extremely well positioned to accelerate growth in this segment. We are also successfully driving adoption among Type 2 users, a large market segment that has tremendous long-term growth potential, particularly as CGM becomes more widely adopted. We are learning that Omnipod is uniquely well suited for Type 2 users. Because awareness of Omnipod remains low, we are investing to raise awareness across the globe. We are advancing our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the U.S., as well as our pilot program in Europe, primarily in the United Kingdom. While our DTC efforts remain in early stages, the response has been encouraging in all markets where we\u2019ve tested it. And we believe DTC is a contributing factor that helped to drive record U.S. and global new customer starts this past quarter. Our growth is also supported by our superior technology, robust innovation pipeline and expanding clinical evidence that shows how life-changing Omnipod can be for people living with diabetes. The tube-free Omnipod experience is unique, and we know from our clinical trial participants that Omnipod 5 will be a transformative product for Insulet and for the diabetes community. We cannot wait to bring it to market. We are making good progress in this regard, and our recent interactions with the FDA continue to give us confidence in a second half limited market release. A third quarter FDA clearance is unlikely, so we now estimate clearance will be later in the fourth quarter. Through our ongoing collaborations as part of the breakthrough devices program, among other things, the FDA has provided clarity on open questions related to full smartphone control. Based on their feedback, we are updating our smartphone app to add a product feature, and we are working through the final steps towards clearance. This work is well underway and gives us confidence in our expected clearance timing. Insulet is a pioneer in this space with full phone control and we are grateful for the agency\u2019s support and guidance and delighted to be close to clearance. Achieving full smartphone control is a complex and novel innovation that we know will be enthusiastically welcomed by our customers. We are committed to providing the best possible user experience and getting Omnipod 5 to market as quickly as possible. While we work through to clearance, our teams are successfully securing pharmacy coverage for Omnipod 5, testing all elements of our customer experience and preparing for a successful limited market release. No other product on the market delivers the value, technology and functionality of Omnipod 5. We believe it will significantly change the lives of people with diabetes and their caregivers through unparalleled ease of use, better quality of life and improved outcomes. From a commercial perspective, we previously communicated the core components of our pricing and access strategies. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 will be available only through the pharmacy, and it will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. We will continue to provide no upfront costs and no long-term lock-in period. In addition, any customer, whether an MDI or tubed pump user will be able to try Omnipod 5 for free at any time through our 30 Days of Freedom program, which has already helped to fuel increased Omnipod adoption. Given this approach, we expect the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod 5 will be comparable to Omnipod DASH and MDI, which we believe is a tremendous value given the improved outcomes and quality of life Omnipod 5 delivers. The majority of our Omnipod DASH customers in the U.S. have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50, and we are thrilled to offer the same benefit to our Omnipod 5 customers. We have already contracted more coverage for Omnipod 5 than what Omnipod DASH had after commercial launch, setting us up for a successful limited market release. The value Omnipod 5 can deliver to people with diabetes is clear, as demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we recently shared at major diabetes conferences, including Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal and pivotal extension results and our non-AID system data. While we are proud of all the impressive Omnipod data, our Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal data certainly stands out. Our study represented the largest data set of primary outcomes for any AID system down to age 2. The results were compelling and included a statistically significant overall A1c reduction, a significant increase in time and range and no severe adverse events. 100% of the preschool participants moved into the extension phase, which shows these families did not want to give up their systems. This clearly speaks to the tremendous value children and their parents experience on Omnipod 5. The results mirrored Omnipod 5\u2019s strong performance across other age groups, including up to age 70. This is quite an accomplishment as many experts agree the pediatric age group is the most challenging for clinical care. The results also demonstrated a significant improvement in sleep for caregivers. It\u2019s a very common concern for concerned parents. We are so pleased to see these young children greatly benefit from our technology. They are often unable to verbalize how they are feeling and are too young to manage this complicated disease on their own. We believe Omnipod 5 will greatly ease the burden of diabetes for these vulnerable children and their caregivers. Another major highlight of our pivotal extension was the further reduction in A1C levels because they already were significantly reduced during the first pivotal phase. To see a greater reduction speaks to the durable power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes management. While we are proud of all of our clinical results, there is much more to do, and we will continue to invest in our clinical road map, including expanding Omnipod 5\u2019s indication down to H2 and for Type 2. Our preschool internal clinical efforts are advancing well, yet our FDA submission is contingent upon the timing of Omnipod 5 clearance. We are now planning for this expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, our Type 2 feasibility study is advancing. We recently concluded the 3-month study period and are now in the extension phase. We expect to share the results of our Type 2 study at an upcoming conference. Finally, while the upcoming clearance and launch of Omnipod 5 remain our top priorities, our pipeline is robust, and we believe some of our best innovations are yet to come. As such, investing in our software development, data science and other capabilities remain a critical priority. Our development work is well underway, including iOS and Libre integrations, the international launch of Omnipod 5 and database innovations aimed at providing insights for our customers. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are developing technologies that we believe will simplify and improve the lives of people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Turning to global expansion, we have spent the last few years working to expand awareness and access to Omnipod across our key international markets. Our latest efforts have been in Australia, where we continue to plan for an Omnipod DASH launch this year. This builds upon our expansion into Turkey earlier this year and across Europe and the Middle East last year. We expect our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market, far beyond the estimated 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes across our current global footprint. As we look ahead, we know there are additional opportunities to further expand our addressable market and to help improve the lives of people living with diabetes around the world. We continue to drive strong growth in our international markets with the recent full launch of Omnipod DASH, and we fully expect to bring Omnipod 5 to these markets in the future. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly to further strengthen and scale our global manufacturing operations. We are in a strong position to meet growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, support the upcoming U.S. release of Omnipod 5 and scale our operations to support our future innovation pipeline and geographic expansion initiatives. We\u2019ve made terrific strides on our path to build on our operational excellence, which we believe to be a critical enabler of sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. In closing, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and strategic progress, and we are gearing up for the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5. Our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes has never been more important, and our innovative solutions have never been more needed. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Shacey. We achieved another solid quarter of financial results with building momentum from record global new customer starts and are on track to drive accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. To support our accelerating growth, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives through innovation, clinical, commercial, manufacturing and other supporting functions that position us for sustainable, long-term global growth. We generated 13% revenue growth in the second quarter finishing within our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 16%. As expected, the pandemic\u2019s effect on 2020 global new customer starts impacted results again in Q2 given the annuity nature of our revenue model. Although the impact of the pandemic headwind continues to linger in the United States and is still more challenged in some of our international markets, we expect the major impact is largely behind us. In Q2, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17%, which was at the low end of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected rebates from one of our largest pharmacy partners of approximately $4 million. Approximately half of the adjustment related to a rebate catch-up from prior to Q2. As a reminder, Q2 also had a tough comparison with approximately $4 million to $5 million of channel build in the prior year. During the second quarter, we continued to build our customer base with record U.S. new customer starts, ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption with both Type 1 and Type 2 customers and the mix benefit we realized as we drive increased volume through the pharmacy channel. These growth drivers continue to trend upward in Q2 as Omnipod DASH drove almost 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we grew pharmacy channel volume to over 45% of our total U.S. volume. In Q2, international Omnipod revenue grew 13%, which finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our growth in the quarter was driven by our success with Omnipod DASH in expanding our customer base throughout our markets, as well as the team\u2019s ability to successfully execute through continued COVID-19 challenges. Our global attrition and utilization remained stable during Q2. Drug delivery revenue declined 13% during the second quarter, finishing slightly ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic and are normalizing this year as expected. Gross margin was 69.4% in the second quarter, representing a 640 basis point increase or a 510 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. This expansion was in line with our expectations and marks our highest gross margin reported to date. Overall, our gross margin expansion continues to be driven by our improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, lower COVID-related costs and the mix benefit of increasing volumes in the U.S. pharmacy channel. These benefits were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing, including our third highly automated U.S. line, which is now producing sellable product. Operating expenses were in line with expectations as we continued to invest in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and other commercial investments, including our global direct-to-consumer advertising initiatives and our international expansion plans. Operating margin was 10%, down 220 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, up 40 basis points. Our operating income was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with no near-term maturities and further runway to continue to invest in our business. We ended the quarter with $872 million in cash and short-term investments. We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our capital structure, including successfully executing a $500 million Term Loan B financing. We used the proceeds to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024, which resulted in a $40 million loss on extinguishment that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Additional notes were since converted and now approximately 3% of the original issuance remains outstanding. Following these transactions, on an annual basis, we expect our net cash interest expense will be approximately $30 million and non-cash interest expense will be significantly reduced to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 16% to 20%, including total Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 21%. We continue to expect a full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth range of 22% to 25%. We expect our growth to be driven primarily by expanding Omnipod DASH volume, increased access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model, and the mix benefit in the pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect further penetration and customer adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are less Omnipod 5 incremental revenue than we had previously anticipated and the Q2 rebate adjustment. For international Omnipod, we continue to expect full year 2021 revenue growth in a range of 11% to 15%. Omnipod DASH adoption rates continue to grow following its launch near the end of last year. Despite the lingering impact of COVID across several of our markets during the first half of 2021, our team has successfully driven additional market penetration and strong new customer growth. The runway to expand Omnipod adoption across our international markets is large, and we see clear pathways for future growth. As a reminder, we had a tough comp due to the $8 million to $9 million of pandemic-related inventory we experienced in the prior year as well as from our initial launch of Omnipod DASH. Lastly, we are maintaining our expectations for drug delivery revenue in a range of 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 68% to 69%. The core drivers of our gross margin expansion have not changed as we build scale and create efficiencies throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as the ongoing benefits of volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect to benefit from lower COVID-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year. We view the investments in consumer-focused innovation, our sales and marketing teams and our international expansion efforts as critical to our long-term growth profile. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. Our operating margin expansion will be driven by our strong top line growth and gross margin improvements as well as our expectation that the onetime costs that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year will not recur this year. On a sequential basis, we expect operating margin improvements throughout the second half of this year primarily due to our expected accelerated revenue growth. We continue to expect capital expenditures to increase this year with the investments throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our third quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 11% to 18%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 23%. We expect Q3 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, Q3 growth also benefits from the net impact of estimated distributor channel destocking last year. The significant step-up in our sequential growth rate is primarily due to the impact of channel stocking and destocking in the prior year, volume ramp from our accumulating record-setting new customer start quarters, annualizing the most impactful COVID-19 related quarters from 2020 and, to a lesser degree, the mix benefit from volume through the pharmacy channel. We expect Q3 international Omnipod revenue growth of 8% to 14%. We continue to expect our growth rate to be partially offset by the trailing pandemic-related headwinds that existed in the second half of 2020 and the first half of this year in many of our international markets. Also, as a reminder, Q3 growth is impacted by the estimated 4 million to 5 million distributor channel stocking we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. We expect drug delivery revenue to decline 40% to 28% due to the normalization of order volumes as compared to elevated levels in the prior year resulting from the pandemic. In conclusion, we have sustained momentum throughout the business and are on track to deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion while advancing our strategic imperatives. Our financial position is sound and provides us the flexibility to invest in our leading innovation pipeline, access and awareness initiatives, global sales force, international expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. All of these efforts are designed to drive significant shareholder value over the long-term and strengthen our ability to improve the lives of people with diabetes across the globe. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hi, thanks for the questions. I missed part of the prepared remarks, so apologies, but I did want to get more color on the Omnipod 5 Pod delay. And just to make sure I understand all the moving parts there, what exactly happened and what gives you confidence that you are going to have the approval by Q4?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Travis. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think it may be helpful to take a step back to where we were in May. We had received the agencies\u2019 feedback on our submission, and there were no surprises, which had put us on track for our anticipated timeline. We are very fortunate to be a part of the breakthrough devices program, and that allows us frequent collaboration with the agency. So we took the opportunity to discuss in more detail full mobile phone control and get extreme clarity on the FDA\u2019s response. Their feedback was really helpful for us and valuable and it prompted us to update our app with a feature that we believe will improve the customer experience. So that is basically what\u2019s happened since May. And the work is well underway, including all of our verification and validation testing. And then our assessment of that final work and the FDA\u2019s review and then, of course, some buffer because times are not normal given the COVID work load, that all puts us towards a Q4, we believe, late in Q4 clearance and limited market release. So that\u2019s kind of where we are. I would just emphasize that in the meantime, we are not standing still, the teams are doing great work preparing for a limited market release and I think making really good use of the time that we have while we get to final clearance.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if I am going to use my one question on Omnipod 5, I will ask what is the final feature Shacey? And I guess when do you plan to submit that to FDA? And just given the delays there, what gives you confidence and what\u2019s the buffer that you are incorporating to get to that late Q4 clearance? Thanks for taking the question.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Larry. The feature is related to full smartphone control. So it\u2019s the way that the app interacts with the system. It has nothing to do with our core system or our algorithm, which we know delivered outstanding clinical results across the broadest age range of any AID pivotal study. So nothing that will impact system functionality, but it is something that we believe will deliver a better customer experience. And I think, ultimately, this feedback was helpful for us. What gives us confidence when we think about the limited market release in Q4 is our interactions with the agency. We\u2019ve factored in all of the work that we have underway plus review time and plus buffer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to provide exactly the amount of buffer, but what I will say is we\u2019ve learned a lot because we\u2019ve been under review for quite some time, all while the pandemic has been underway as well. So, we do understand how long the back and forth has been taking, how much longer that\u2019s been than traditional timelines, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored in that points us to Q4. So I think it\u2019s really those interactions that give us that confidence. And we have cleared an enormous amount of hurdles. Up until this time, we really believe we are in the final stages here and remain confident in a second half, but like we said, end of Q4, limited market release and clearance.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks. Two for me. I will ask them both upfront. One on the pharmacy rebate, I was hoping you could just go into a little more detail of exactly what that was and how it worked. Was that \u2013 did you over-earn from this \u2013 from this payer and now you are rebating it back? Is it one-time? How do we think about that? And any further impacts you expect going forward? And then second on the U.S., the results are obviously better when you put the rebate back in. But it would be great to hear what you\u2019re seeing out in the field. Do you think people are holding back on starting Omnipod as they are waiting for Omnipod 5, I am sure they hear it in the news, just thinking about how it\u2019s impacting the field if at all? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure, right. If you want, I can start that one, Shacey, on the rebate question, and glad you brought it up, Robbie, because it gives us an opportunity to share a little bit more color around it. It is due to an updated rebate information from one of our largest pharmacy partners. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that partially related to prior to Q2 and it\u2019s a year-to-date catch-up, and that result changed our rebate expectations as well. So our pharmacy partners have several quarters in arrears to correct their rebate submissions, and we have a wide range of rebate percentage programs and as we execute our strategy and ramp our business in the pharmacy. So we anticipate variability in the rebates. However, this one was much larger than expected. It\u2019s really a growing pain for both of us. It\u2019s new for us, and it\u2019s new for our pharmacy partners. So as they set up our agreements and process rebates for us, this will settle down over time. Once we get a majority of our business in the pharmacy and get more established, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see this type of variability going forward. Although the net rebate this quarter ends up much higher than expected, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy in the pharmacy. It is a significant differentiation for us and better for our customers. So as the pharmacy channel becomes a larger portion of our revenue, rebates will be one of the metrics that could impact our results going forward. And we do \u2013 given the rebate percentage difference there, see some variability. In relation to guidance, it is a metric that we factor into both the high end and the low end.\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Thanks, Wayde. Yes, I think important to emphasize that pharmacy is a strategic pillar for us. And for all, I think Wayde mentioned the reason, obviously, it\u2019s a better customer experience, but it\u2019s also a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet, and that\u2019s really important as we as we get ready to scale with the launch of Omnipod 5. And then your question, Robbie, on what are we hearing in the field. The one thing I would say is behind the numbers, it\u2019s just important and sometimes it gets lost because of the business model. But behind the numbers, we had a record new patient start quarter. So that\u2019s important as we think about are people holding off? It certainly would not be evident in our numbers based on new customer starts in this past quarter. And that said, you\u2019re right that there is growing consumer awareness of Omnipod 5. The company and I personally get daily e-mails from customers that are anxiously waiting. So I don\u2019t believe customers are holding off based on the new customer starts numbers, but there is growing awareness of the technology that\u2019s coming.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I don\u2019t know if this is for Wayde or Shacey, or maybe both of you. But I guess with the approval for Omnipod 5 now coming later this year, consensus pre-today was looking at like 20% growth in 2022. So a slight acceleration if you\u2019re looking at the midpoint of the range. I mean you\u2019re talking about still a limited market release for Omnipod 5. I\u2019d just be curious what you can say about how the change in the timeline for Omnipod 5 might impact the outlook for 2022, if at all, and how that accelerating growth via the consensus numbers again, pre-today, how achievable that might be? Thanks so much.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Maybe I\u2019ll kick us off, and then Wayde can give some comments on any color he wants to give regarding 2022 with Omnipod 5. I think ultimately, we know that the market is waiting for Omnipod 5. So we\u2019re going to do whatever we can to make our limited market release as efficient as possible. It\u2019s important to do a limited market release. If you think about what\u2019s going to happen with Omnipod 5, we know that people today who use DASH or classic Omnipod or multiple daily injections or tubed pumps, they are all going to have a different customer journey coming on to Omnipod 5. They are each different pathways, and we will have different requirements. For example, all our DASH customers already know the benefits of pharmacy and low out-of-pocket costs. We\u2019re going to have to get two pump users or potentially MDI users comfortable with the benefits of the pharmacy and then each of those different patient segments have different training and onboarding needs. And so those are the types of customer experiences that we\u2019re testing today to make sure that we\u2019ve got everything in a great position for the launch. And then the other governor is access. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we gave some color that the team is making great progress establishing access. So we are doing everything that we can to make as efficient an LMR as possible. But we do want to do one. And hopefully, we \u2013 well, not hopefully, today, for sure, we are in a better position today than we were a quarter ago. And a quarter from now, we\u2019re going to be in an even stronger position. So I think we\u2019re going to head into 2022 in a really strong position and hopefully keep the LMR as efficient as possible.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. And just picking up on the guidance part of the question there, Danielle, we aren\u2019t guiding to 2022 yet. But can certainly appreciate the question. And we can provide some color on how we\u2019re thinking about the U.S. guidance for \u201822 at this point in time. 2022 is going to be a strong year for us. And we will include the ramp of Omnipod 5 in 2022. However, as you\u2019re asking about here, and as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, that with the LMR now starting most likely at the end of Q4, that we would expect that some portion of the LMR will extend into 2022 with full market release coming sometime later in 2022. And so we won\u2019t likely get a full year \u2013 a full market release in 2022 at this point, but it is going to be a very strong year for us. And so we\u2019re not going to comment specifically on guidance numbers or ranges at this point. A couple of other things to think about, the pandemic is always a consideration. And given our annuity model and the persistence of the pandemic here into 2021, it will be somewhat of a headwind for us in 2022. But we\u2019ve got a ways to go here throughout the rest of \u201821. We will see what the Delta variant and how warnings in some countries and some of the challenges that are coming out impact us. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be free and clear of it yet in 2022. But let\u2019s see how things progress through the rest of 2021. And then as usual, we will give our guidance in the Q1 call. We do have other tailwinds and growth drivers that are accelerating here into the second half, and that momentum will carry into 2022. Further DASH penetration, the Type 1 and Type 2 customer adoption really being aided by CGM, so we\u2019re riding that wave as well. We\u2019re continuing to expand in the pharmacy with our pay-as-you-go model, our direct-to-consumer program. So, a lot of momentum in the business, quite a few tailwinds, a couple of headwinds that we are monitoring and that\u2019s some color for you, we will get into the 2022 guidance on our Q1 call.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you, good afternoon guys. Let me just \u2013 Wayde or Shacey, I guess, either one follow-up on Danielle\u2019s question there and ask it maybe a slightly different way. When we thought Omnipod 5 was coming maybe midyear or so, it was kind of a 6-month limited market release. But Shacey, to your point, a lot of that, I think, was getting commercial coverage in place, and it sounds like you\u2019re making good progress there. Is it fair to think about that LMR then could be cut in half? Think about it as one quarter and then moving by second quarter into that full market release? And Wayde, I know \u2013 respect that you\u2019re not giving \u201822 guidance, but it feels like there should be some shortening of that LMR schedule given the commercial coverage you\u2019ve already established? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. We are going to do everything that we can to drive as efficient in a limited market release as possible. I think just something to keep in mind is limited market releases are designed to uncover things that weren\u2019t contemplated in all of the testing and launch preparation. So I think that\u2019s the caution. Of course, we are in a stronger position. We\u2019re securing coverage. I think all of this sets us up for success and in trying to shorten the limited market release. But I caution everybody by saying, if we bump into something we are going to address that. That\u2019s the whole purpose of doing a limited market release. I think the teams are doing great work, and certainly ameliorating the potential of running into something with all of the work that we\u2019re doing, and we are certainly establishing access, which is one of the main governors. And so those are great signs. But I don\u2019t \u2013 of course, we\u2019re going to take our learnings from the limited market release, and we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re providing the best possible customer experience.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I know everybody is focused on the 5, slippage here. But I\u2019m curious about the core business. And to your point, Shacey, that the growth in new patients was the record that you saw. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the dynamics there that are driving new patient additions so much higher if it\u2019s Type 2s, if it\u2019s pediatrics. Just talk about some of those dynamics and then how those might, may be augmented once you can get 5 on the market more so next year. Thank you.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Actually, I think it\u2019s really exciting to see what\u2019s happening with the core business right now. What\u2019s driving our growth? I would point to two \u2013 well, three dynamics. The first is DTC. So this investment that we\u2019re making in raising awareness is definitely working and we think was one of the drivers for our record \u2013 by quite a bit in the U.S. new patient starts. And that\u2019s coming broadly across Type 1, primarily among multiple daily injection users and then also Type 2. And so Type 2 would be the second dynamic that I would point to. We are in a pretty rarified position here. Nobody else is having the success that we\u2019re having unlocking this market opportunity. And it\u2019s because we have a product that is uniquely well suited to the Type 2 user in its simplicity and in its cost profile. And so that\u2019s the third piece, is the pharmacy and pay-as-you-go. And that\u2019s helping certainly to make our technology more accessible and more affordable to the people that are becoming increasingly aware of it. And the reason why we like these dynamics, these underlying dynamics is because when we launch Omnipod 5, it will be additive to these things. We are \u2013 we fully intend to maintain our advantage in Type 2. We fully intend to maintain our advantage in the pharmacy and our pay-as-you-go model. And we\u2019re going to then deliver what we think will be a game-changing technology in Omnipod 5 to the market. And so the team could not be more excited because we\u2019ve got this underlying momentum that\u2019s being \u2013 that\u2019s helping to deliver record-setting new patient starts. And of course, we\u2019re all gearing up \u2013 every aspect of the company right now is gearing up for an Omnipod 5 launch and just incredibly excited about what it will bring to patients. So I think it\u2019s an exciting additive technology to what is already a really strong momentum in our business, particularly in the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus in on the pharmacy channel and kind of that increase in adoption this quarter. It does seem like it did pop up, certainly for new patient starts and perhaps for active users as well. So was there something different that you guys were doing to drive that uptake? Is it DTC? And I guess, as we look a year from now, where should we see that active base or is it just going to be a little bit more predetermined on the launch and timing of Omnipod 5? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Great question, Margaret. So there is a few things happening. One, we continue to tick up access, and that increased notably. And as we increase access then more people in our base have the opportunity to move into the pharmacy. So that\u2019s one piece of it. The second is DTC is definitely driving demand. And if you think about now, where Wayde mentioned at cumulative record-setting quarter, so three quarters where we\u2019ve got \u2013 in our new customer starts, I think on each of those quarters, between 70% and 80% of customers going directly into the pharmacy or directly on to DASH, the vast majority of that in the pharmacy. So that trend is just helping to drive more and more people into the pharmacy. I think in terms of where does this go, we fully expect to have the majority \u2013 or vast majority of our business in the pharmacy over the coming years. We do see Omnipod 5 as a big driver there. Omnipod 5 will be only available in the pharmacy. We know that there is growing demand among our existing users and also among the market. And so that will help us to continue to accelerate that move into the pharmacy. And I would also point to Type 2, all of our Medicare business is through the pharmacy. So as Type 2 grows, that is growing in the pharmacy, and that\u2019s a great thing. What pharmacy does by providing Omnipod at the same out-of-pocket cost as multiple daily injection, it\u2019s really remarkable for DASH today, and it\u2019s going to be even more remarkable for Omnipod 5 tomorrow. So, just really great cost effective therapy for our patients.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Excuse me, good afternoon. I\u2019ve kind of been going in and out, so hopefully, this question isn\u2019t repetitive. But just on access, you mentioned that you\u2019re progressing on your contracting efforts with Omnipod 5. Any way you can frame where you are with contracting and does this make the launch less limited, if you will?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Jayson, great question. So we \u2013 rather than giving details, just kind of conceptually where we are with access, we have more access established, more covered lives today with Omnipod 5 preceding launch than we did following launch with Omnipod DASH. So that puts us, I think, in a really strong position and a really nice trajectory as we get closer to launch. Every quarter, we establish more access for Omnipod 5. So as we get closer to launch, we\u2019re certainly not standing still, but the teams are making great use of this time. And I think to your point, that sets us up for a successful, and what we certainly hope, is a very efficient limited market release. Because we knew that there are two primary governors to limited market release, one is access. And as you note, the team is making great progress there. The other is customer experience. And that\u2019s the one where we can\u2019t really sort of say how quick that\u2019s going to be until we get into the throes of it. I think the team is doing a really nice job testing all of the different pathways, testing the training and onboarding processes, testing the benefits investigation, all of that stuff. But that\u2019s the type of thing that you really need live patients going through the process to test effectively. But that will be, I think, the primary governor as we look to move from limited market release into full market release, given how well we\u2019re doing with access.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask just maybe a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, Shacey, this is in the second or third time on these calls you talked about investments you\u2019re making in software. I think traditionally, we\u2019ve become more accustomed to products in med tech being more focused on tangible things, like widgets and insulin pumps that you can touch. Maybe help us understand how you think about, maybe not necessarily with O-5, but maybe the next generation of products that are going to be maybe more software focused. And just how that might change the patient and the physician experience of the technology and the value you\u2019re providing?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Kyle, thank you for the question. I think a great opportunity to just talk about the position that we see ourselves in as it relates to patient data. Very few companies have access to the volume of data that Insulet will have with Omnipod 5. We had mentioned earlier on a previous call that we\u2019re putting SIM cards into our Omnipod 5 controllers. And then, of course, we will be offering full phone control, which means that we will have stream of real-time data coming off of a user that helps us understand how their continuous glucose is doing, helps us understand how they are interacting with the system. Helps us understand how much insulin is being delivered, when it\u2019s being suspended, when they are eating. And so that provides us with incredible potential to generate insights that can be valuable to our customers, to their clinicians and potentially to payers as well in population analytics. And so we see ourselves just really well positioned, because it\u2019s essentially a wearable technology that\u2019s providing real-time data that we believe can help us help people achieve better outcomes through a variety of mechanisms. So I think you\u2019ll hear us talk more about that as we get Omnipod 5 to market, how we see that and our role in that for our customers, including our consumers, our clinicians and our payers, but we do believe we\u2019re very well positioned to provide value here.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I think one of the things that I\u2019m hearing in the patterns of the questions tonight is, is there a positive thing that comes out of this delay? Does it mean you need to have a shorter limited launch? Does it maybe accelerate your Type 2 label or your product with Abbott\u2019s Libre? And is there any way to address that or is just everything is pushed back, call it, 6 months?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes, Joanne, I think the positive thing that comes out of this is that the FDA has given us really valuable, helpful feedback that we think will ultimately enable us to deliver a product that is even better. But \u2013 and I also believe that the limited market release will be shorter as a result of this time that we\u2019ve had to establish coverage. So that is good. How much shorter? That will rely on us really testing the customer experience and understanding if we\u2019ve got learnings there that need to be incorporated or adjusted to. But the value that we\u2019ve been able to have during this time is just the opportunity to establish coverage and continue to test the customer experience. Both of those things should help us to deliver a more efficient limited market release.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. I hope everyone is doing well. A question on just collaboration behind the scenes on Omnipod 5 with Dexcom, they had some bullish language on their earnings call in the past couple of days. So just wondering what level of collaboration is going on behind the scenes ahead of launch later this year. That would be the first question. And then the follow-up question would just be maybe a longer term, sort of, opinion and view on the automated insulin delivery space, how you see it evolving next 2 to 3 years when you consider that we now have multiple offerings, either on market or coming to market imminently? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Anthony. Dexcom has been an outstanding partner, and it has been remarkable to see what they have done in the market and the value that they provided consumers. We really believe that they are helping to drive AID adoption, and so we could not be more excited for our combination offering. They have helped us across a number of fronts and collaboration has been incredibly strong. And obviously, they have an incredible technology. And so that combined with Omnipod and Omnipod 5, we think is going to be a game changer in the market. It will be a game changer in terms of patient experience and patient outcomes, and it will be a game changer in the market in terms of our position. So we\u2019re strong collaborators, strong partners today, and then, of course, working on G7 and future integration. And so that would be a really exciting part of our pipeline as well. In terms of the AID market, I think it\u2019s very exciting to see what\u2019s occurring out there. We see the trend in terms of CGM adoption among Type 1s. And what\u2019s happening now with AID gives us great confidence that among Type 1 users, the pump market will double. And a big part of that will be automated insulin delivery. Of course, we believe we\u2019re going to deliver the best to market and \u2013 or the best product to market. And I think the thing that gives us excitement is that we have been competing so effectively with our non-AID system. And so, people are choosing Omnipod even though there is no CGM integration, and despite the fact that we\u2019ve seen such dramatic uptake in CGM. So we think that we\u2019re going to see the real power of the form factor now that we\u2019ve got CGM integration and automated insulin delivery with Omnipod 5, because people will no longer really have a reason to choose an alternative device, which we know many people \u2013 if they prefer the pod form factor but choose another system because of Dexcom integration. And so we\u2019re really excited to even the playing ground there and really frankly leapfrog the field there. And then the other thing I would point to is just Type 2. All of these trends are more mature in Type 1. And I talk sometimes about the competitive field, but I would say that among this large patient population, no one really needs to lose for us to win. They are \u2013 if you look at the field, even in Type 1 where there is more maturity here, still today, somewhere north of third of patients are using pump therapy. So there is a great opportunity for all of us to impact patient outcomes and provide better technology, better care for people living with Type 1 diabetes. The same trends are just burgeoning among Type 2. And so we\u2019re really excited about our position there, and we expect that both CGM and certainly Omnipod 5 and integrated devices are going to grow among Type 2 users too over the coming years.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nRavi Misra: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Good evening. So just kind of maybe jumping on that last question, a little bit more big picture. You said earlier potential doubling of the pump market. I\u2019m just curious, there is a lot of things going on here with access and new technologies and telemedicine that could kind of support that kind of statement. But just what do you think is, if I can kind of put it philosophically, just curious what do you think still needs work on in terms of getting us from that 35% to 40% today, to maybe significant majority of insulin delivery through pumps that\u2019s not in existence right now, but something that is in your control? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Ravi, I think you highlighted quite a few of them. When you talk about new technology and access, I would say for both of those, it is just how simple can we make both of those. How simple can we make the technology so that it can be easily and enthusiastically adopted by the masses, and how simple can we make access. Because still today, Omnipod has changed the game with pay-as-you-go in the pharmacy and we\u2019ve made it simpler. But still today, there is too many hurdles for people to get on to these technologies, and that\u2019s something we are committed to continuing to work to eliminate. So I would point to simplicity and technology, simplicity and access. And the last thing I would point to is awareness. And we\u2019re really seeing it with DTC. We\u2019re investing in awareness. And we\u2019re probably making a big impact in the market and helping everybody at the end of the day because we\u2019re increasing patients\u2019 awareness to technology. But what we saw before we invested in DTC was that patients awareness, even a Type 2 consumers\u2019 awareness of their options, unaided awareness, was somewhere around 15%. So even a person with Type 1 could only name a pump manufacturer 15% of the time. So there is a massive opportunity here to just help people understand and gain more awareness to the treatment options that are available to them. And then we need to make them cost-effective and simple to access and to use.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Shacey, I was wondering if you could talk about international. What are the biggest incremental drivers we should be focused on for you guys internationally over the next, say, 6 to 12 months? Is it \u2013 whether it\u2019s in terms of new countries or particular countries where DASH has recently launched and anything you can talk about relative to potential timing of Omnipod 5 outside of the U.S.? Thanks.\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, Steve. When we think about international and the drivers there, DASH and continued expansion internationally will be drivers, particularly the adoption of Omnipod DASH, which we know is doing really well across our international markets, but room to continue to grow there. And new market additions, so now in the last year or so, we\u2019ve added a handful of markets that will contribute over time. But any new market addition, for us internationally, takes time to accumulate new users. It\u2019s just the way that our business model works. So we view international as a long-term growth driver, and we will continue to invest in expanding into new markets that will drive growth over time. We, of course, also are really excited to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets, which we view as the next growth driver. We aren\u2019t going to give a timeline on that yet. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market first in the U.S., and then we will update our timelines on things that everybody is asking about, iOS integration, Libre integration, G7 and international. But all of that work, every program I just mentioned is underway. And certainly, we\u2019re going to aim to follow as quickly as we can once we get Omnipod 5 to market in the U.S., which we could not be more excited to do.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see, we continue to drive our strategy forward, and we have great momentum throughout the business and real confidence in our outlook. We are halfway through the year and what we expect will be another successful year for Insulet. The clinical evidence we shared speaks to the tremendous value our technology offers to those living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And we could just not be more excited for the launch of Omnipod 5, because we are confident it will mark an important new chapter for Insulet and, more importantly, for those living with diabetes worldwide. Thanks so much. Have a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

We achieved another solid quarter of financial results with building momentum from record global new customer starts and are on track to drive accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. To support our accelerating growth, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives through innovation, clinical, commercial, manufacturing and other supporting functions that position us for sustainable, long-term global growth. We generated 13% revenue growth in the second quarter finishing within our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 16%. As expected, the pandemic's effect on 2020 global new customer starts impacted results again in Q2 given the annuity nature of our revenue model. Although the impact of the pandemic headwind continues to linger in the United States and is still more challenged in some of our international markets, we expect the major impact is largely behind us. In Q2, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17%, which was at the low end of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected rebates from one of our largest pharmacy partners of approximately $4 million. Approximately half of the adjustment related to a rebate catch-up from prior to Q2. As a reminder, Q2 also had a tough comparison with approximately $4 million to $5 million of channel build in the prior year. During the second quarter, we continued to build our customer base with record U.S. new customer starts, ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption with both Type 1 and Type 2 customers and the mix benefit we realized as we drive increased volume through the pharmacy channel. These growth drivers continue to trend upward in Q2 as Omnipod DASH drove almost 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we grew pharmacy channel volume to over 45% of our total U.S. volume. In Q2, international Omnipod revenue grew 13%, which finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our growth in the quarter was driven by our success with Omnipod DASH in expanding our customer base throughout our markets, as well as the team's ability to successfully execute through continued COVID-19 challenges. Our global attrition and utilization remained stable during Q2. Drug delivery revenue declined 13% during the second quarter, finishing slightly ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic and are normalizing this year as expected. Gross margin was 69.4% in the second quarter, representing a 640 basis point increase or a 510 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. This expansion was in line with our expectations and marks our highest gross margin reported to date. Overall, our gross margin expansion continues to be driven by our improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, lower COVID-related costs and the mix benefit of increasing volumes in the U.S. pharmacy channel. These benefits were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing, including our third highly automated U.S. line, which is now producing sellable product. Operating expenses were in line with expectations as we continued to invest in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and other commercial investments, including our global direct-to-consumer advertising initiatives and our international expansion plans. Operating margin was 10%, down 220 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, up 40 basis points. Our operating income was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with no near-term maturities and further runway to continue to invest in our business. We ended the quarter with $872 million in cash and short-term investments. We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our capital structure, including successfully executing a $500 million Term Loan B financing. We used the proceeds to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024, which resulted in a $40 million loss on extinguishment that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Additional notes were since converted and now approximately 3% of the original issuance remains outstanding. Following these transactions, on an annual basis, we expect our net cash interest expense will be approximately $30 million and non-cash interest expense will be significantly reduced to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 16% to 20%, including total Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 21%. We continue to expect a full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth range of 22% to 25%. We expect our growth to be driven primarily by expanding Omnipod DASH volume, increased access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model, and the mix benefit in the pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect further penetration and customer adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are less Omnipod 5 incremental revenue than we had previously anticipated and the Q2 rebate adjustment. For international Omnipod, we continue to expect full year 2021 revenue growth in a range of 11% to 15%. Omnipod DASH adoption rates continue to grow following its launch near the end of last year. Despite the lingering impact of COVID across several of our markets during the first half of 2021, our team has successfully driven additional market penetration and strong new customer growth. The runway to expand Omnipod adoption across our international markets is large, and we see clear pathways for future growth. As a reminder, we had a tough comp due to the $8 million to $9 million of pandemic-related inventory we experienced in the prior year as well as from our initial launch of Omnipod DASH. Lastly, we are maintaining our expectations for drug delivery revenue in a range of 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 68% to 69%. The core drivers of our gross margin expansion have not changed as we build scale and create efficiencies throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as the ongoing benefits of volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect to benefit from lower COVID-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year. We view the investments in consumer-focused innovation, our sales and marketing teams and our international expansion efforts as critical to our long-term growth profile. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. Our operating margin expansion will be driven by our strong top line growth and gross margin improvements as well as our expectation that the onetime costs that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year will not recur this year. On a sequential basis, we expect operating margin improvements throughout the second half of this year primarily due to our expected accelerated revenue growth. We continue to expect capital expenditures to increase this year with the investments throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our third quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 11% to 18%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 23%. We expect Q3 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, Q3 growth also benefits from the net impact of estimated distributor channel destocking last year. The significant step-up in our sequential growth rate is primarily due to the impact of channel stocking and destocking in the prior year, volume ramp from our accumulating record-setting new customer start quarters, annualizing the most impactful COVID-19 related quarters from 2020 and, to a lesser degree, the mix benefit from volume through the pharmacy channel. We expect Q3 international Omnipod revenue growth of 8% to 14%. We continue to expect our growth rate to be partially offset by the trailing pandemic-related headwinds that existed in the second half of 2020 and the first half of this year in many of our international markets. Also, as a reminder, Q3 growth is impacted by the estimated 4 million to 5 million distributor channel stocking we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. We expect drug delivery revenue to decline 40% to 28% due to the normalization of order volumes as compared to elevated levels in the prior year resulting from the pandemic. In conclusion, we have sustained momentum throughout the business and are on track to deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion while advancing our strategic imperatives. Our financial position is sound and provides us the flexibility to invest in our leading innovation pipeline, access and awareness initiatives, global sales force, international expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. All of these efforts are designed to drive significant shareholder value over the long-term and strengthen our ability to improve the lives of people with diabetes across the globe. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sure, right. If you want, I can start that one, Shacey, on the rebate question, and glad you brought it up, Robbie, because it gives us an opportunity to share a little bit more color around it. It is due to an updated rebate information from one of our largest pharmacy partners. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that partially related to prior to Q2 and it's a year-to-date catch-up, and that result changed our rebate expectations as well. So our pharmacy partners have several quarters in arrears to correct their rebate submissions, and we have a wide range of rebate percentage programs and as we execute our strategy and ramp our business in the pharmacy. So we anticipate variability in the rebates. However, this one was much larger than expected. It's really a growing pain for both of us. It's new for us, and it's new for our pharmacy partners. So as they set up our agreements and process rebates for us, this will settle down over time. Once we get a majority of our business in the pharmacy and get more established, I don't think we'll see this type of variability going forward. Although the net rebate this quarter ends up much higher than expected, it doesn't change our strategy in the pharmacy. It is a significant differentiation for us and better for our customers. So as the pharmacy channel becomes a larger portion of our revenue, rebates will be one of the metrics that could impact our results going forward. And we do \u2013 given the rebate percentage difference there, see some variability. In relation to guidance, it is a metric that we factor into both the high end and the low end. Yes. And just picking up on the guidance part of the question there, Danielle, we aren't guiding to 2022 yet. But can certainly appreciate the question. And we can provide some color on how we're thinking about the U.S. guidance for \u201822 at this point in time. 2022 is going to be a strong year for us. And we will include the ramp of Omnipod 5 in 2022. However, as you're asking about here, and as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, that with the LMR now starting most likely at the end of Q4, that we would expect that some portion of the LMR will extend into 2022 with full market release coming sometime later in 2022. And so we won't likely get a full year \u2013 a full market release in 2022 at this point, but it is going to be a very strong year for us. And so we're not going to comment specifically on guidance numbers or ranges at this point. A couple of other things to think about, the pandemic is always a consideration. And given our annuity model and the persistence of the pandemic here into 2021, it will be somewhat of a headwind for us in 2022. But we've got a ways to go here throughout the rest of \u201821. We will see what the Delta variant and how warnings in some countries and some of the challenges that are coming out impact us. But I don't think we're going to be free and clear of it yet in 2022. But let's see how things progress through the rest of 2021. And then as usual, we will give our guidance in the Q1 call. We do have other tailwinds and growth drivers that are accelerating here into the second half, and that momentum will carry into 2022. Further DASH penetration, the Type 1 and Type 2 customer adoption really being aided by CGM, so we're riding that wave as well. We're continuing to expand in the pharmacy with our pay-as-you-go model, our direct-to-consumer program. So, a lot of momentum in the business, quite a few tailwinds, a couple of headwinds that we are monitoring and that's some color for you, we will get into the 2022 guidance on our Q1 call."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We have reached the midpoint of the year and continue to deliver solid financial and operational performance and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. We've maintained sharp focus on executing our strategy and driving growth and have sustained momentum across our business. Our outlook is also strong and we are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, including meaningful acceleration during the second half. During the second quarter, we achieved 13% revenue growth, including total Omnipod growth of 16%. Our results met our expectations despite a headwind from higher-than-anticipated rebate adjustments in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Absent these, we drove revenue results both in terms of volume growth and mix benefit that exceeded our expectations. We also achieved another quarterly record of U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts, which gives us great confidence and enthusiasm for Insulet's future. While our team remains squarely focused on Omnipod 5 clearance efforts, we made terrific progress across each of our strategic imperatives. We expanded coverage and volume growth of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy, drove continued adoption in the Type 2 market where we are uniquely positioned, once again drove strong MDI conversions and presented compelling clinical data at the ATTD and ADA conferences. These accomplishments demonstrate both the success we're having unlocking the Type 2 market with our innovative product and business model, and the acceleration we expect in the Type 1 market with the launch of Omnipod 5. We have delivered consistently strong performance in these critical areas without an automated insulin delivery system in the market, which speaks to the power of Omnipod, the unique advantages of our pay-as-you-go business model and the differentiated customer experience we provide. Regarding our Omnipod 5 AID system, we are in the final stages of the FDA review process and are incredibly appreciative of the agency's diligence and collaboration, particularly given the pandemic workload. While we continue to expect FDA clearance and limited market release in the second half of 2021, we believe Q3 clearance is unlikely and now estimate that both will happen later in the fourth quarter. We remain incredibly excited about what Omnipod 5 will offer the diabetes community. Our market position, which is already strong, will be greatly enhanced by the introduction of Omnipod 5. We are well prepared, have invested in our sales teams, expanded our manufacturing capacity and made great progress securing payer support. Our efforts in these areas will continue as we work through the final stages of the clearance process. We are confident in a successful launch of Omnipod 5, and I will share more on that in a few minutes. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Beginning with access and awareness, the global diabetes market is growing rapidly, with millions of people expected to be newly diagnosed this year alone and rapid adoption of CGM among people living with Type 1 diabetes and more recently, Type 2 diabetes. Despite such a large and fast growing market, it remains critically underserved, and awareness of and access to technology remain far too low. We continue to expand access and utilization through the pharmacy, which provides a better customer experience, a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet. In the second quarter, we grew Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to approximately 80%, a sizable sequential increase. This drove a notable increase of U.S. volume through the pharmacy in Q2. Omnipod DASH continues to be our primary growth driver, with the majority of our new customers across the globe starting on this system. Approximately 80% of our U.S. new customer starts are consistently driven by MDI conversions, and a percentage of our U.S. new customers that were Type 2 during the second quarter remained strong at 35% to 40%, even with the record-setting growth in new customer starts. In the Type 1 segment, historically large numbers of MDI users are adopting technology, which gives us continued confidence that AID will drive a doubling of the pump market in the coming years. We are pleased with our current growth in Type 1, which is a testament to Omnipod's differentiation. And as we look ahead to Omnipod 5, we expect to be extremely well positioned to accelerate growth in this segment. We are also successfully driving adoption among Type 2 users, a large market segment that has tremendous long-term growth potential, particularly as CGM becomes more widely adopted. We are learning that Omnipod is uniquely well suited for Type 2 users. Because awareness of Omnipod remains low, we are investing to raise awareness across the globe. We are advancing our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the U.S., as well as our pilot program in Europe, primarily in the United Kingdom. While our DTC efforts remain in early stages, the response has been encouraging in all markets where we've tested it. And we believe DTC is a contributing factor that helped to drive record U.S. and global new customer starts this past quarter. Our growth is also supported by our superior technology, robust innovation pipeline and expanding clinical evidence that shows how life-changing Omnipod can be for people living with diabetes. The tube-free Omnipod experience is unique, and we know from our clinical trial participants that Omnipod 5 will be a transformative product for Insulet and for the diabetes community. We cannot wait to bring it to market. We are making good progress in this regard, and our recent interactions with the FDA continue to give us confidence in a second half limited market release. A third quarter FDA clearance is unlikely, so we now estimate clearance will be later in the fourth quarter. Through our ongoing collaborations as part of the breakthrough devices program, among other things, the FDA has provided clarity on open questions related to full smartphone control. Based on their feedback, we are updating our smartphone app to add a product feature, and we are working through the final steps towards clearance. This work is well underway and gives us confidence in our expected clearance timing. Insulet is a pioneer in this space with full phone control and we are grateful for the agency's support and guidance and delighted to be close to clearance. Achieving full smartphone control is a complex and novel innovation that we know will be enthusiastically welcomed by our customers. We are committed to providing the best possible user experience and getting Omnipod 5 to market as quickly as possible. While we work through to clearance, our teams are successfully securing pharmacy coverage for Omnipod 5, testing all elements of our customer experience and preparing for a successful limited market release. No other product on the market delivers the value, technology and functionality of Omnipod 5. We believe it will significantly change the lives of people with diabetes and their caregivers through unparalleled ease of use, better quality of life and improved outcomes. From a commercial perspective, we previously communicated the core components of our pricing and access strategies. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 will be available only through the pharmacy, and it will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. We will continue to provide no upfront costs and no long-term lock-in period. In addition, any customer, whether an MDI or tubed pump user will be able to try Omnipod 5 for free at any time through our 30 Days of Freedom program, which has already helped to fuel increased Omnipod adoption. Given this approach, we expect the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod 5 will be comparable to Omnipod DASH and MDI, which we believe is a tremendous value given the improved outcomes and quality of life Omnipod 5 delivers. The majority of our Omnipod DASH customers in the U.S. have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50, and we are thrilled to offer the same benefit to our Omnipod 5 customers. We have already contracted more coverage for Omnipod 5 than what Omnipod DASH had after commercial launch, setting us up for a successful limited market release. The value Omnipod 5 can deliver to people with diabetes is clear, as demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we recently shared at major diabetes conferences, including Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal and pivotal extension results and our non-AID system data. While we are proud of all the impressive Omnipod data, our Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal data certainly stands out. Our study represented the largest data set of primary outcomes for any AID system down to age 2. The results were compelling and included a statistically significant overall A1c reduction, a significant increase in time and range and no severe adverse events. 100% of the preschool participants moved into the extension phase, which shows these families did not want to give up their systems. This clearly speaks to the tremendous value children and their parents experience on Omnipod 5. The results mirrored Omnipod 5's strong performance across other age groups, including up to age 70. This is quite an accomplishment as many experts agree the pediatric age group is the most challenging for clinical care. The results also demonstrated a significant improvement in sleep for caregivers. It's a very common concern for concerned parents. We are so pleased to see these young children greatly benefit from our technology. They are often unable to verbalize how they are feeling and are too young to manage this complicated disease on their own. We believe Omnipod 5 will greatly ease the burden of diabetes for these vulnerable children and their caregivers. Another major highlight of our pivotal extension was the further reduction in A1C levels because they already were significantly reduced during the first pivotal phase. To see a greater reduction speaks to the durable power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes management. While we are proud of all of our clinical results, there is much more to do, and we will continue to invest in our clinical road map, including expanding Omnipod 5's indication down to H2 and for Type 2. Our preschool internal clinical efforts are advancing well, yet our FDA submission is contingent upon the timing of Omnipod 5 clearance. We are now planning for this expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, our Type 2 feasibility study is advancing. We recently concluded the 3-month study period and are now in the extension phase. We expect to share the results of our Type 2 study at an upcoming conference. Finally, while the upcoming clearance and launch of Omnipod 5 remain our top priorities, our pipeline is robust, and we believe some of our best innovations are yet to come. As such, investing in our software development, data science and other capabilities remain a critical priority. Our development work is well underway, including iOS and Libre integrations, the international launch of Omnipod 5 and database innovations aimed at providing insights for our customers. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are developing technologies that we believe will simplify and improve the lives of people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Turning to global expansion, we have spent the last few years working to expand awareness and access to Omnipod across our key international markets. Our latest efforts have been in Australia, where we continue to plan for an Omnipod DASH launch this year. This builds upon our expansion into Turkey earlier this year and across Europe and the Middle East last year. We expect our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market, far beyond the estimated 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes across our current global footprint. As we look ahead, we know there are additional opportunities to further expand our addressable market and to help improve the lives of people living with diabetes around the world. We continue to drive strong growth in our international markets with the recent full launch of Omnipod DASH, and we fully expect to bring Omnipod 5 to these markets in the future. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly to further strengthen and scale our global manufacturing operations. We are in a strong position to meet growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, support the upcoming U.S. release of Omnipod 5 and scale our operations to support our future innovation pipeline and geographic expansion initiatives. We've made terrific strides on our path to build on our operational excellence, which we believe to be a critical enabler of sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. In closing, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and strategic progress, and we are gearing up for the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5. Our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes has never been more important, and our innovative solutions have never been more needed. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Sure, Travis. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think it may be helpful to take a step back to where we were in May. We had received the agencies' feedback on our submission, and there were no surprises, which had put us on track for our anticipated timeline. We are very fortunate to be a part of the breakthrough devices program, and that allows us frequent collaboration with the agency. So we took the opportunity to discuss in more detail full mobile phone control and get extreme clarity on the FDA's response. Their feedback was really helpful for us and valuable and it prompted us to update our app with a feature that we believe will improve the customer experience. So that is basically what's happened since May. And the work is well underway, including all of our verification and validation testing. And then our assessment of that final work and the FDA's review and then, of course, some buffer because times are not normal given the COVID work load, that all puts us towards a Q4, we believe, late in Q4 clearance and limited market release. So that's kind of where we are. I would just emphasize that in the meantime, we are not standing still, the teams are doing great work preparing for a limited market release and I think making really good use of the time that we have while we get to final clearance. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Larry. The feature is related to full smartphone control. So it's the way that the app interacts with the system. It has nothing to do with our core system or our algorithm, which we know delivered outstanding clinical results across the broadest age range of any AID pivotal study. So nothing that will impact system functionality, but it is something that we believe will deliver a better customer experience. And I think, ultimately, this feedback was helpful for us. What gives us confidence when we think about the limited market release in Q4 is our interactions with the agency. We've factored in all of the work that we have underway plus review time and plus buffer. I don't think it's helpful to provide exactly the amount of buffer, but what I will say is we've learned a lot because we've been under review for quite some time, all while the pandemic has been underway as well. So, we do understand how long the back and forth has been taking, how much longer that's been than traditional timelines, and that's what we've factored in that points us to Q4. So I think it's really those interactions that give us that confidence. And we have cleared an enormous amount of hurdles. Up until this time, we really believe we are in the final stages here and remain confident in a second half, but like we said, end of Q4, limited market release and clearance. Great. Thanks, Wayde. Yes, I think important to emphasize that pharmacy is a strategic pillar for us. And for all, I think Wayde mentioned the reason, obviously, it's a better customer experience, but it's also a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet, and that's really important as we as we get ready to scale with the launch of Omnipod 5. And then your question, Robbie, on what are we hearing in the field. The one thing I would say is behind the numbers, it's just important and sometimes it gets lost because of the business model. But behind the numbers, we had a record new patient start quarter. So that's important as we think about are people holding off? It certainly would not be evident in our numbers based on new customer starts in this past quarter. And that said, you're right that there is growing consumer awareness of Omnipod 5. The company and I personally get daily e-mails from customers that are anxiously waiting. So I don't believe customers are holding off based on the new customer starts numbers, but there is growing awareness of the technology that's coming. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Maybe I'll kick us off, and then Wayde can give some comments on any color he wants to give regarding 2022 with Omnipod 5. I think ultimately, we know that the market is waiting for Omnipod 5. So we're going to do whatever we can to make our limited market release as efficient as possible. It's important to do a limited market release. If you think about what's going to happen with Omnipod 5, we know that people today who use DASH or classic Omnipod or multiple daily injections or tubed pumps, they are all going to have a different customer journey coming on to Omnipod 5. They are each different pathways, and we will have different requirements. For example, all our DASH customers already know the benefits of pharmacy and low out-of-pocket costs. We're going to have to get two pump users or potentially MDI users comfortable with the benefits of the pharmacy and then each of those different patient segments have different training and onboarding needs. And so those are the types of customer experiences that we're testing today to make sure that we've got everything in a great position for the launch. And then the other governor is access. And that's one of the reasons why we gave some color that the team is making great progress establishing access. So we are doing everything that we can to make as efficient an LMR as possible. But we do want to do one. And hopefully, we \u2013 well, not hopefully, today, for sure, we are in a better position today than we were a quarter ago. And a quarter from now, we're going to be in an even stronger position. So I think we're going to head into 2022 in a really strong position and hopefully keep the LMR as efficient as possible. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. We are going to do everything that we can to drive as efficient in a limited market release as possible. I think just something to keep in mind is limited market releases are designed to uncover things that weren't contemplated in all of the testing and launch preparation. So I think that's the caution. Of course, we are in a stronger position. We're securing coverage. I think all of this sets us up for success and in trying to shorten the limited market release. But I caution everybody by saying, if we bump into something we are going to address that. That's the whole purpose of doing a limited market release. I think the teams are doing great work, and certainly ameliorating the potential of running into something with all of the work that we're doing, and we are certainly establishing access, which is one of the main governors. And so those are great signs. But I don't \u2013 of course, we're going to take our learnings from the limited market release, and we're going to make sure that we're providing the best possible customer experience. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Actually, I think it's really exciting to see what's happening with the core business right now. What's driving our growth? I would point to two \u2013 well, three dynamics. The first is DTC. So this investment that we're making in raising awareness is definitely working and we think was one of the drivers for our record \u2013 by quite a bit in the U.S. new patient starts. And that's coming broadly across Type 1, primarily among multiple daily injection users and then also Type 2. And so Type 2 would be the second dynamic that I would point to. We are in a pretty rarified position here. Nobody else is having the success that we're having unlocking this market opportunity. And it's because we have a product that is uniquely well suited to the Type 2 user in its simplicity and in its cost profile. And so that's the third piece, is the pharmacy and pay-as-you-go. And that's helping certainly to make our technology more accessible and more affordable to the people that are becoming increasingly aware of it. And the reason why we like these dynamics, these underlying dynamics is because when we launch Omnipod 5, it will be additive to these things. We are \u2013 we fully intend to maintain our advantage in Type 2. We fully intend to maintain our advantage in the pharmacy and our pay-as-you-go model. And we're going to then deliver what we think will be a game-changing technology in Omnipod 5 to the market. And so the team could not be more excited because we've got this underlying momentum that's being \u2013 that's helping to deliver record-setting new patient starts. And of course, we're all gearing up \u2013 every aspect of the company right now is gearing up for an Omnipod 5 launch and just incredibly excited about what it will bring to patients. So I think it's an exciting additive technology to what is already a really strong momentum in our business, particularly in the U.S. Yes. Great question, Margaret. So there is a few things happening. One, we continue to tick up access, and that increased notably. And as we increase access then more people in our base have the opportunity to move into the pharmacy. So that's one piece of it. The second is DTC is definitely driving demand. And if you think about now, where Wayde mentioned at cumulative record-setting quarter, so three quarters where we've got \u2013 in our new customer starts, I think on each of those quarters, between 70% and 80% of customers going directly into the pharmacy or directly on to DASH, the vast majority of that in the pharmacy. So that trend is just helping to drive more and more people into the pharmacy. I think in terms of where does this go, we fully expect to have the majority \u2013 or vast majority of our business in the pharmacy over the coming years. We do see Omnipod 5 as a big driver there. Omnipod 5 will be only available in the pharmacy. We know that there is growing demand among our existing users and also among the market. And so that will help us to continue to accelerate that move into the pharmacy. And I would also point to Type 2, all of our Medicare business is through the pharmacy. So as Type 2 grows, that is growing in the pharmacy, and that's a great thing. What pharmacy does by providing Omnipod at the same out-of-pocket cost as multiple daily injection, it's really remarkable for DASH today, and it's going to be even more remarkable for Omnipod 5 tomorrow. So, just really great cost effective therapy for our patients. Yes, Jayson, great question. So we \u2013 rather than giving details, just kind of conceptually where we are with access, we have more access established, more covered lives today with Omnipod 5 preceding launch than we did following launch with Omnipod DASH. So that puts us, I think, in a really strong position and a really nice trajectory as we get closer to launch. Every quarter, we establish more access for Omnipod 5. So as we get closer to launch, we're certainly not standing still, but the teams are making great use of this time. And I think to your point, that sets us up for a successful, and what we certainly hope, is a very efficient limited market release. Because we knew that there are two primary governors to limited market release, one is access. And as you note, the team is making great progress there. The other is customer experience. And that's the one where we can't really sort of say how quick that's going to be until we get into the throes of it. I think the team is doing a really nice job testing all of the different pathways, testing the training and onboarding processes, testing the benefits investigation, all of that stuff. But that's the type of thing that you really need live patients going through the process to test effectively. But that will be, I think, the primary governor as we look to move from limited market release into full market release, given how well we're doing with access. Yes, Kyle, thank you for the question. I think a great opportunity to just talk about the position that we see ourselves in as it relates to patient data. Very few companies have access to the volume of data that Insulet will have with Omnipod 5. We had mentioned earlier on a previous call that we're putting SIM cards into our Omnipod 5 controllers. And then, of course, we will be offering full phone control, which means that we will have stream of real-time data coming off of a user that helps us understand how their continuous glucose is doing, helps us understand how they are interacting with the system. Helps us understand how much insulin is being delivered, when it's being suspended, when they are eating. And so that provides us with incredible potential to generate insights that can be valuable to our customers, to their clinicians and potentially to payers as well in population analytics. And so we see ourselves just really well positioned, because it's essentially a wearable technology that's providing real-time data that we believe can help us help people achieve better outcomes through a variety of mechanisms. So I think you'll hear us talk more about that as we get Omnipod 5 to market, how we see that and our role in that for our customers, including our consumers, our clinicians and our payers, but we do believe we're very well positioned to provide value here. Yes, Joanne, I think the positive thing that comes out of this is that the FDA has given us really valuable, helpful feedback that we think will ultimately enable us to deliver a product that is even better. But \u2013 and I also believe that the limited market release will be shorter as a result of this time that we've had to establish coverage. So that is good. How much shorter? That will rely on us really testing the customer experience and understanding if we've got learnings there that need to be incorporated or adjusted to. But the value that we've been able to have during this time is just the opportunity to establish coverage and continue to test the customer experience. Both of those things should help us to deliver a more efficient limited market release. Thanks, Anthony. Dexcom has been an outstanding partner, and it has been remarkable to see what they have done in the market and the value that they provided consumers. We really believe that they are helping to drive AID adoption, and so we could not be more excited for our combination offering. They have helped us across a number of fronts and collaboration has been incredibly strong. And obviously, they have an incredible technology. And so that combined with Omnipod and Omnipod 5, we think is going to be a game changer in the market. It will be a game changer in terms of patient experience and patient outcomes, and it will be a game changer in the market in terms of our position. So we're strong collaborators, strong partners today, and then, of course, working on G7 and future integration. And so that would be a really exciting part of our pipeline as well. In terms of the AID market, I think it's very exciting to see what's occurring out there. We see the trend in terms of CGM adoption among Type 1s. And what's happening now with AID gives us great confidence that among Type 1 users, the pump market will double. And a big part of that will be automated insulin delivery. Of course, we believe we're going to deliver the best to market and \u2013 or the best product to market. And I think the thing that gives us excitement is that we have been competing so effectively with our non-AID system. And so, people are choosing Omnipod even though there is no CGM integration, and despite the fact that we've seen such dramatic uptake in CGM. So we think that we're going to see the real power of the form factor now that we've got CGM integration and automated insulin delivery with Omnipod 5, because people will no longer really have a reason to choose an alternative device, which we know many people \u2013 if they prefer the pod form factor but choose another system because of Dexcom integration. And so we're really excited to even the playing ground there and really frankly leapfrog the field there. And then the other thing I would point to is just Type 2. All of these trends are more mature in Type 1. And I talk sometimes about the competitive field, but I would say that among this large patient population, no one really needs to lose for us to win. They are \u2013 if you look at the field, even in Type 1 where there is more maturity here, still today, somewhere north of third of patients are using pump therapy. So there is a great opportunity for all of us to impact patient outcomes and provide better technology, better care for people living with Type 1 diabetes. The same trends are just burgeoning among Type 2. And so we're really excited about our position there, and we expect that both CGM and certainly Omnipod 5 and integrated devices are going to grow among Type 2 users too over the coming years. Ravi, I think you highlighted quite a few of them. When you talk about new technology and access, I would say for both of those, it is just how simple can we make both of those. How simple can we make the technology so that it can be easily and enthusiastically adopted by the masses, and how simple can we make access. Because still today, Omnipod has changed the game with pay-as-you-go in the pharmacy and we've made it simpler. But still today, there is too many hurdles for people to get on to these technologies, and that's something we are committed to continuing to work to eliminate. So I would point to simplicity and technology, simplicity and access. And the last thing I would point to is awareness. And we're really seeing it with DTC. We're investing in awareness. And we're probably making a big impact in the market and helping everybody at the end of the day because we're increasing patients' awareness to technology. But what we saw before we invested in DTC was that patients awareness, even a Type 2 consumers' awareness of their options, unaided awareness, was somewhere around 15%. So even a person with Type 1 could only name a pump manufacturer 15% of the time. So there is a massive opportunity here to just help people understand and gain more awareness to the treatment options that are available to them. And then we need to make them cost-effective and simple to access and to use. Yes. Thanks, Steve. When we think about international and the drivers there, DASH and continued expansion internationally will be drivers, particularly the adoption of Omnipod DASH, which we know is doing really well across our international markets, but room to continue to grow there. And new market additions, so now in the last year or so, we've added a handful of markets that will contribute over time. But any new market addition, for us internationally, takes time to accumulate new users. It's just the way that our business model works. So we view international as a long-term growth driver, and we will continue to invest in expanding into new markets that will drive growth over time. We, of course, also are really excited to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets, which we view as the next growth driver. We aren't going to give a timeline on that yet. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market first in the U.S., and then we will update our timelines on things that everybody is asking about, iOS integration, Libre integration, G7 and international. But all of that work, every program I just mentioned is underway. And certainly, we're going to aim to follow as quickly as we can once we get Omnipod 5 to market in the U.S., which we could not be more excited to do. Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see, we continue to drive our strategy forward, and we have great momentum throughout the business and real confidence in our outlook. We are halfway through the year and what we expect will be another successful year for Insulet. The clinical evidence we shared speaks to the tremendous value our technology offers to those living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And we could just not be more excited for the launch of Omnipod 5, because we are confident it will mark an important new chapter for Insulet and, more importantly, for those living with diabetes worldwide. Thanks so much. Have a great evening."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. \nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our first quarter 2021 results and 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA in constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. \nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are off to a strong start to the year, with first quarter revenue growth of 24%. Both our U.S. and international diabetes product lines achieved solid results with total Omnipod growth of 19%. We are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We have sustained momentum across our business, and we are preparing for the highly anticipated launch of Omnipod 5. We continue to execute at a high level, which speaks to the strength of our team and our deep commitment to Insulet's mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During the first quarter, we advanced each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Let's begin with access and awareness and how Omnipod remains well positioned to further eliminate access barriers and displace legacy therapies. The progress we've made to date is largely due to the differentiated customer experience Omnipod provides, our tubeless form factor, simple user interface, unique business model and expanding presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. There are millions of people around the globe living with diabetes, and yet this population is critically underserved. There are far too many people that either don't have access to Omnipod, are unaware of our product, or in some cases, both. This must change as Omnipod can simplify lives and deliver improved outcomes. The value Omnipod provides is clearly demonstrated by our ability to drive new customer growth from multiple daily injection users in the type one and type two segments. Approximately 80% of our new customers switch from MDI to Omnipod. Additionally, in the first quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new U.S. customers were type 2. Much of this growth has been driven by Omnipod DASH, which offers tremendous benefits compared to existing therapies. As a result, we continue to transition a growing percentage of our U.S. pod volume through our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. This provides increased access for customers, low co-pays and no upfront costs or multiyear lock-in periods. It simplifies access, making Omnipod easier to prescribe for physicians, provides a number of benefits to payers and drives our recurring revenue. Today, our technology and form factors stand at the forefront of innovation, while our U.S. pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model are eliminating long-standing access barriers. This combination uniquely positions Insulet to further penetrate both the type one and type two insulin intensive markets. By the end of Q1, we had secured coverage for over 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, and the majority of our new customers across the globe start on Omnipod DASH. At the same time, we are focused on expanding Omnipod awareness, given the diabetes market is large, yet critically underserved. Last year, we launched our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the United States. The reaction to date has been positive, and we have already started to see incremental new customer starts. We have also begun to pilot DTC in the United Kingdom. It is early days for both our domestic and international campaigns. But we know there is tremendous opportunity to help more people across the globe learn about the life-changing benefits of Omnipod. Driving access and awareness are core components of our growth strategy and complement our commitment to delivering market-leading innovation. We believe the combination of enhanced access and superior innovation, improves outcomes and makes living with diabetes or caring for loved ones less burdensome. All of this has resulted in consistently strong Omnipod adoption and customer retention and a global customer base that surpassed 0.25 million people in Q1. We accomplished this despite not having an AID product in the market, and this will soon change with our Omnipod five automated insulin delivery system, which we believe is the future of insulin delivery. Omnipod five unlocks a new level of freedom and simplicity through easier insulin management and significantly improved glucose control. The number of firsts Omnipod five brings to market is compelling. It is the first tubeless, entirely wearable AID system with a personalized, adaptive on-target algorithm embedded in every pod. This means there is no need to disconnect or interrupt therapy other than the few minutes it takes to change a pod every three days. This is critical as interruptions in continuous insulin delivery lead to suboptimal outcomes. Managing diabetes will be easier and more discrete as Omnipod five customers will have complete smartphone control for all system functions. At launch, we will offer full control from personal Android smartphones and every customer will also receive a controller that includes a SIM card. This marks another important distinction between Omnipod five and other options available in the market. No other AID system offers real-time connectivity, even when not near WiFi and real-time remote monitoring through SIM and personal phone control. Omnipod five users will always be able to view their data on their smartphones and loved ones will always be able to know how their Podders are doing in real time on the Omnipod five VIEW app. Omnipod five is the only system with customizable glucose targets for different times of day and also a hypo protect feature that can be used in times of greater hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, our AID system is the only one to provide a smart bolus calculator that recommends more or less insulin based on a user's CGM trend, not just the CGM value alone. All of this while maintaining the same form factor our customers love. We are confident that Omnipod five will mark a major improvement in quality of life and diabetes management. In the U.S., Omnipod five will be available only through the pharmacy channel. We'll utilize our unique pay-as-you-go model and will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. As a result, the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod five should be comparable to both Omnipod DASH and MDI. Like Omnipod DASH, we expect the majority of Omnipod five customers in the U.S. to have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50. In addition, through our 30 Days of Freedom trial, anyone can try Omnipod five free for 30 days. Our goal is to quickly secure broad affordable coverage and expanded access. We believe the broad coverage we have established for Omnipod DASH will continue to serve as a major competitive advantage and a strong foundation for our efforts to drive access to Omnipod 5. Although Omnipod five has breakthrough device designation and the FDA has been incredibly supportive and collaborative throughout its review process, the clearance time line is taking longer than we had anticipated. The feedback we have received to date has been in line with our expectations, and we remain optimistic that we will receive Omnipod five clearance by the end of June or shortly thereafter. But given the current environment and the associated lengthened review time, clearance could shift into the second half of the year. As a result, we now expect to begin our limited commercial release in the second half of 2021. We do not expect this will have a material impact on revenue guidance, and our internal teams are certainly not standing still. We are building Omnipod five inventory. We are developing commercial launch materials and testing our systems and processes, and we are securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Our teams are geared up for what we fully expect will be the best technology and customer experience on the market and a wildly successful launch. The value Omnipod five offers to people with diabetes was clearly demonstrated via the impressive pivotal data we shared in March at ENDO 2021. Our pivotal study included children and adults ages six to 70. Compared to standard therapy, Omnipod five achieved significantly higher time and range and improved A1c while maintaining or lowering hyperglycemia. After three months on Omnipod 5, 53% of children and 66% of adults achieved an A1c of less than 7%. Time and range for children increased 16 points to 68%, while timing range for adults and adolescents increased nine points to 74%. Additionally, time in hypoglycemia was reduced for adults and remained very low in children. Omnipod five will offer meaningful value for individuals living with diabetes as well as for their families, physicians and payers. It's a clear testament to our innovation team that we were able to achieve this very competitive time in range, while also delivering the strongest published hypoglycemia performance. We have additional Omnipod five abstracts accepted for presentation at upcoming diabetes conferences in June. These address a number of important areas, including performance in preschool aged children, the transition from multiple daily injections directly on to Omnipod five and quality of life outcomes. Also on the clinical front, we had impactful domestic and international data recently published in several leading peer-reviewed diabetes journals. Collectively, the results shared in these publications demonstrate that Omnipod can drive improved outcomes across a broad range of people living with either type one or type two diabetes. These improved outcomes span multiple age groups and disease states as well as people coming from different forms of therapy. We continue to invest clinically and have a compelling road map, including our work to expand our Omnipod five indication to preschoolers down to H2 and to secure a type two indication. The first phase of our preschool study is complete, and we are progressing well through our planned 12-month extension phase, which allows us to collect longer durable outcomes and allows our trial participants to continue on Omnipod 5, which they all elected to do. Additionally, our type two feasibility study is now fully enrolled and the results are illuminating. During ENDO 2021, Dr. Bruce Bode presented early data from our type two study that showed encouraging results for Omnipod 5, with time and range that more than doubled in the first eight weeks. The type two diabetes market offers tremendous opportunity for Insulet, and we will continue to innovate to further penetrate this largely underserved population. The depth and breadth of the clinical data published and presented in just this last quarter demonstrates our commitment to building strong clinical evidence that supports how Omnipod will continue to improve outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We continue to advance our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing additional clinical data in the future. Omnipod five is our top innovation priority. However, we are diligently working to advance a robust pipeline that extends well beyond. We know that our success over the long term requires leadership in critical areas such as software development, data science and other core competencies. This includes the integration of Omnipod five and our future products with next generations of products by Dexcom and Abbott. Beyond Omnipod 5, we have begun product development on innovations that we believe will offer significant value to people living with both type one and type two diabetes. Moving to global expansion. We are expanding access and awareness of Omnipod in a number of attractive markets. Last year, we entered five new countries within Europe and the Middle East. This quarter, we expanded into Turkey, and we continued to gear up for an expected launch in Australia later this year. Our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market. Across our current footprint, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We see attractive future expansion opportunities that will further grow our total addressable market and bring our technology to people living with diabetes around the world. The international launch of Omnipod DASH has been highly successful and work is underway to bring Omnipod five to our international markets. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly in our global manufacturing operations. We are well positioned to meet growing consumer demand for Omnipod DASH as well as the commercial launch of Omnipod 5, our broader innovation pipeline and our future international expansion plans. Operational excellence is one of our key strategic imperatives that is enabling growth today and will do so well into the future. As part of this strategy, Insulet is committed to responsible and sustainable growth. We have developed a comprehensive sustainability strategy that builds upon our existing capabilities, provides value to our stakeholders and considers the most important ESG issues that affect our business, society and planet. We recently published our 2020 sustainability report, which outlines our commitment to addressing important ESG issues and highlights our key priorities. All of us at Insulet are dedicated to a business resiliency and responsible business practices that help our customers, our employees and our communities thrive. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, launch Omnipod five and advance our innovation pipeline to continue to bring life-changing innovations to people with diabetes in order to simplify and improve their lives. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. \nWayde McMillan: Thank you, Shacey. We continue to execute at a high level and look forward to the limited market release of Omnipod 5. Our strategic imperatives are supported by continued investments across our business to drive long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. We delivered 24% revenue growth in the first quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong total Omnipod growth of 19%. As we previously discussed, the pandemic's impact on global new customer starts in 2020 will have a compounding impact in 2021, primarily in the first half. While the pandemic is persisting globally with ongoing challenges mainly throughout Europe and Canada, we are navigating them well and driving continued growth. In the U.S., our new customer starts were a record for any Q1 in our history, and second only to the very strong Q4 we achieved last year. We accomplished this while also driving strong international performance. In Q1, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23%, benefiting from our growing customer base, Omnipod DASH adoption and ongoing mix benefit as we shift volume into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH continues to ramp and drove over 70% of our U.S. new customer starts. In addition, we grew pharmacy channel volume to approximately 45% of our total U.S. volume. This is up significantly compared to last year, representing a meaningful increase and contributing to our top line growth. Expanding our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel remains a key strategic imperative as we plan to drive increased access for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod five once launched. International Omnipod revenue grew 13%, ahead of our expectations. Performance was driven primarily from our expanding customer base and ability to navigate through COVID-19-related challenges. The full launch of Omnipod DASH throughout our international markets last year is helping to drive growth this year as the majority of our international new customers start on Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH continues to generate physician interest and drive hospital access. To a smaller degree, international Omnipod revenue in Q1 also benefited from timing of PDM orders, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter given our distributor channels. We are also pleased that our global attrition and utilization once again were stable this past quarter. Drug delivery revenue more than doubled in line with our expectations. Growth was unusually high due to increased product demand this year versus the low production levels last year, which resulted from a slower than typical manufacturing start-up. Both of these drivers were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin was 66.4% in the first quarter, representing a 230 basis point increase or 120 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. Our gross margin expansion was driven primarily by improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, the ongoing benefit as we transition more volume into the pharmacy channel in the U.S. and a decrease in COVID-related mitigation costs. Partially offsetting these increases were the expected higher mix of costs as we continued to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $151 million, primarily due to our investments to support our innovation pipeline development efforts and the upcoming launch of Omnipod five as well as our broader direct-to-consumer advertising. Operating margin was 6.5%, up from 3.8% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, up from 12.3%, all were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're off to a great start in 2021 as both our diabetes product lines generated record performance, and we continued to invest across our organization to support our growth strategies and drive future expansion. This includes increasing advertising to drive brand awareness, and strengthening our commercial and R&D resources to support Omnipod five and our innovation pipeline as well as geographic expansion. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the first quarter with $850 million in cash and short-term investments. We recently completed a $500 million Term Loan B financing as well as a separate $60 million revolving line of credit. Our goal over the long term is to strengthen our access to traditional capital market financing, diversify our capital structure and over time, drive our gross leverage ratio down to 5 times bank EBITDA. This marked our first step and an important one in that direction. We plan to use the Term Loan B financing to pay down a portion of our outstanding convertible notes due 2024. This will lower our cost of capital while also maintaining flexibility to pursue future strategic investments. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 16% to 20%, up from prior 15% to 20%. This includes raising the low end of total Omnipod revenue guidance to 18% to 21%. In the U.S., we are raising the low end of full year Omnipod revenue growth to 22% to 25%. This will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth, the benefits of our efforts to drive expanded access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. Also driving growth is our expectation for further Omnipod customer adoption in both the type one and type two markets. We also expect growth will benefit to a lesser degree from the limited market release of Omnipod 5. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of full year 2021 guidance to 11% to 15%. In the near term, we continue to expect our international business to be impacted by the pandemic and related challenges, combined with the compounding impact on new customer starts from 2020. With that said, we are encouraged by the adoption rates of Omnipod DASH and our plan for driving expanded market penetration internationally. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revenue expectations for drug delivery in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect full year gross margin in the range of 67% to 70%. Our gross margin expansion drivers remain the same: increased scale and efficiencies provided by our global manufacturing operations and positive mix from the continued volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. We also benefit from a planned reduction in COVID-related mitigation and safety-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year as we invest in consumer-focused innovation and best position ourselves for increased market penetration. This includes investments in our sales and marketing teams ahead of the launch of Omnipod five and to support our international market initiatives. As a result of our strong revenue growth, combined with gross margin expansion and the investments we are making across our business, we are reaffirming operating margin for full year 2021 in the low double-digit range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. We expect operating margin will improve sequentially throughout the year. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021 as we further invest in our global manufacturing operations and strategic imperatives to support our strong growth expectations. Turning to our second quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 14%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 14% to 17%. We expect Q2 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 20%, driven primarily by our growing customer base fueled by Omnipod DASH volume growth and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q2 growth is impacted by the tough prior year comparison where we experienced a net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels at the start of the pandemic. We expect international Omnipod revenue growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the ongoing growth in our customer base from increased Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the headwind of lower new customer starts in 2020, stemming from the pandemic as well as the continued pandemic impacts throughout many of our international markets. Also, the benefit in Q1 from the timing of Omnipod DASH PDM orders is not expected to occur again in Q2. We also expect drug delivery revenue to decline 16% to 24% due to the normalization of order volumes in the current year as compared to elevated levels in the prior year due to the pandemic. In conclusion, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We remain on track for robust revenue growth and operating margin expansion continue to advance our strategic imperatives and are in a solid financial position to continue to invest for growth. We are building a foundation for long-term sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion and increased value creation for our stakeholders. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Operator  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Sorry, guys, I was on mute. Shacey, I just wanted to start with a question on the timing around Omnipod 5. It sounds like -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but a couple of few weeks of potential delay here. That's kind of the wording we heard last night from one of your competitors on a mobile bolus app. So I guess, two things. One is, are some of these delays tied more to just the FDA is overwhelmed right now with COVID-related items? Or maybe overwhelmed in some other way? Are they nervous at all on phone and mobile bolusing apps and just kind of phone control? Just wondering kind of what you're hearing from the FDA for that delay? And how confident are you that it might be that short time period, however long you want to define that? \nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Well, I think it's true. It's kind of an industry-wide thing. Like others, we are experiencing the longer-than-expected review process. I don't believe this is due to anything but just the workload, frankly, at the agency. And we're really sensitive to that. They have done an incredible job navigating through all of the challenges related to the pandemic. Our local team, our review team has been incredibly responsive and collaborative. And so we feel very good about where we are, we're in the final stages of this review process. And I don't believe that there's any sort of any other drivers outside of the workload tied to the pandemic. In fact, we gave ourselves quite a bit of buffer in the time line. And so my remarks are really prompted by the fact that we're getting through that buffer. And so the review process is taking a bit longer than we expected. But we're in the final stages and feel good about where we are. \nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Two for me. One, Wayde, I'd love to get a sense of after you gave guidance at the end of February on the fourth quarter earnings call, how the rest of third quarter trended? I know diabetes can sometimes have different trends than what we see across the rest of med tech in terms of procedure volumes? And then how it played out versus your expectations throughout the rest of the quarter?\nWayde McMillan: Robbie, yes, sounds good. And it's actually a really good question because there's quite a few dynamics rolling out. And I think diabetes does have some uniqueness to it. So why don't we think about it first in the U.S. and what we've seen in the U.S. is really at the end of 2020, we saw the access to customers and the market really start to turn. We're still dealing with some pandemic issues in the U.S., but we really saw it start to level out in the end of Q4 '20 and obviously, with a 23% growth rate here in the quarter start to pick up. One thing we've talked about in the past that was unexpected was we thought we would see seasonality change a little bit more in Q1 in -- moved into the pharmacy. We have 45% of our volume in the pharmacy now and we really didn't see that. So that was kind of a unique impact. And we think it's really due to the fact that customers still have buying patterns that are related to the legacy market paradigm here in diabetes and the traditional order patterns of buying more in Q4 as well as people throughout the value chain, distributors, wholesalers, even physicians thinking about prescribing pumps at the end of the year versus the start of the year. So I think it's going to take more time than we expected to see some of those seasonal trends take place. And as we think about the rest of the year for the U.S., I mean, really strong. We think we've got a strong guide for the second half, and we start to build momentum. Just a reminder that we do have an annuity model here at Insulet. And so we start to build momentum. We had a record Q1 start -- new customer starts here. We had a record Q4 in 2020. So you put those two together, and we're starting to build momentum up again and you see that start to build in our growth rate here in the second half. That's implied in our guide. And then internationally, it's a different story. We are seeing the pandemic persist. It was longer and more difficult through the end of 2020. And we can see that as it rolls into our annuity model here in the first half of 2021. And so we'll see that persist longer internationally. Having said that, we still feel we had a pretty strong growth rate, 13% in the face of the challenges that the team has seen internationally. And just to highlight a couple of the things we're dealing with. We're -- our business is concentrated in a few of the larger regions like the U.K. and France. And those are the regions where we've seen more lockdowns and more persistence of the pandemic. And so when some of those regions are more challenged, it's harder for our teams to get in and get customers started on new product. But I mentioned in the prepared remarks, where we are seeing good traction is a lot of interest in our new DASH product, and so that is giving our teams reasons to meet with physicians and with customers. And so we are starting to see signs of improvement internationally as well. We do think it will persist a little longer into the second half, and that's reflected in our growth rates. At the high end of our growth rates, we get up to that 17% range. And as you know, our expectations for the region are high-teens, low-20s. So optimistically, if we see the pandemic start to calm down internationally as well, we'll start to get back into that high-teens growth rate.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Shacey, one on type two patients. This is the second quarter in a row, it was 35% to 40%. Do you see it stabilizing there? Or do you see it growing further? And secondly, how often are type two patients changing their pods. They tend to use more insulin? So are they doing it more frequently than every three days on average?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Larry, great questions. I'll start with the first one. We actually haven't really seen a change in utilization that is noticeable at the population level between type two and type 1. And I think that comes down to a reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And in fact, we mentioned this in the press release, but we had some incredible data published this last quarter, most recently -- or on type two rather, the data was published in diabetes research and clinical practice. And this looked at almost 3,600 patients and demonstrated statistically significant reduction in A1c, but maybe even more surprisingly a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And that was regardless of which therapy they were coming from multiple daily injections or previous pump therapy. So I think that points to the value of Omnipod and site rotation among other things, and it's probably playing out in the patient experience out there, which is why we don't see, broadly, utilization increasing in the population. It was steady this quarter. And then the other question that you had, on type 2... \nWayde McMillan: 35% to 40%.\nShacey Petrovic: Was 35% to 40%. It actually has ticked up every quarter. It's just a broad range. So it is growing, and it is probably growing faster than our total new customers, which are growing quickly as well.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Marissa Bych from Morgan Stanley.\nMarissa Bych: This is Marissa Bych from Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to go back, Wayde, and I appreciate your commentary on the second quarter guidance and the ex U.S. COVID-19 impact is very understandable. In the U.S., it seems like the sequential growth that we're expecting for the second quarter versus the first quarter is a little bit lower than history, just based on pharmacy seasonality. Is that really the entirety of the story in the U.S.? Or is there anything else that we're missing in terms of COVID resurgences or really anything else?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Marissa, I think you've got most of it. I would just highlight one of the things I called out in the prepared remarks was the tough comp we have, and that's because of the inventory build we saw last year in Q2 at the start of the pandemic. That's about a 5% impact to the growth rate. So if you add -- if you just add that tough comp for the inventory last year, that puts us into the mid-20s, even above the Q1 growth rate and so that's in there. But as you mentioned, there's also some dynamics between Q1 and Q2. The pharmacy channel, we're still learning. It's still new to us and we're still monitoring it and to see how that plays out. But another way to think about Q2 for us is we have -- at the high end of our guide, a similar sequential dollar growth rate, $12 million growth rate, same as we experienced last year. So that's another thing to ground on. We'll see how it goes. We're also closely watching the pandemic in the U.S. We're not free and clear of that yet, and the teams are doing a great job selling through it. Our virtual training capabilities are really helping us here. And we'll see how that continues to play out in the U.S. We're very optimistic with vaccine rollout across the U.S. and things continued to improve. And again, if you normalize for the growth rate that puts us into that mid-20s. And then our implied growth rate in the U.S. for the second half is mid to high-20s. And so in an annuity model, just a reminder for everybody, it takes several quarters to build up the new customer starts. Last year, Q2 for us was a low new customer start quarter, but we still had 30% growth because of the momentum coming into the quarter. So we're excited here to be building momentum again, setting record new customer start quarters. And if we can continue to do that, you'll see the growth rates climb into that guidance -- implied guidance of high 20% growth rates in the second half.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Brandon on for Margaret. I wanted to follow up on the type two Omnipod five data. It sounds really encouraging that the data is coming out nicely. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more details on what the next steps are there. Does the -- do the algorithms need to be tweaked for the type two patient? Or can we kind of move forward with what you have now and run additional data, if that's what's needed? So just trying to understand what next steps are for type two and Omnipod 5.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Brandon. Thank you for the question. And yes, as I mentioned, this has been an area of focus for us. We're really excited about the early data that Dr. Bruce Bode presented at ENDO. And we believe that the data was very positive so far with our feasibility study. So we will take this data and if it remains positive as we close out the feasibility data, we will be able to move into a pivotal. But we'll sort of reserve the right to potentially make changes to the algorithm depending on the final results that we get out of our feasibility study. But so far, so good. The data is really encouraging to date.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: I apologize if this has been asked. I've kind of been jumping between calls here. And I don't mean to be critical with the question because obviously, the growth is impressive here. But you've developed a history of exceeding estimates. This quarter, I'd say it was at the high end but didn't necessarily exceed. Was there anything specific that you saw in the month of March that maybe you didn't expect?\nWayde McMillan: Jayson, it's Wayde. I can take that one. Well, first of all, international was above the high end of the range and the U.S. was right at the high end of the range. So there wasn't anything too much to really complain about, as you said. The one thing that was a little surprising to us is we were expecting some more favorable seasonality in Q1 in the pharmacy channel. Now that we've got 45% of our volume rolling through there. It was a small thing, but that was one thing that we are expecting to see. And we do think that will continue to develop, it just may take a few years to change behavior, not just for customers but all through the value chain. But other than that, as you know, Jayson, we've got a lot of new things going on in both regions, but in particular in the U.S., the pay-as-you-go model is still relatively new. Our move into type two is new. The DTC campaigns are new. Even DASH uptake is still accelerating for us. So as we think about guidance, we've got a lot of puts and takes, and we're very happy still dealing with the pandemic to print the 23% growth rate. On a dollar basis, I think the strongest of all the companies out there and we're continuing to expand our leadership position. And so I think as we're approaching $1 billion, our growth rates don't look as impressive as some others, but we're happy to be growing stronger on a dollar basis.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: This question, Shacey, is around the type two opportunity. And you guys have been so successful there. So I don't want to sound too greedy, but it feels like there's still such an untapped opportunity today, even with all the work you've done and all the success you've had at the primary care physician level. We've been doing a lot of work here and talking to primary care physicians. And it feels like they manage so many of these patients, there's still a lot of opportunities. So just curious if you could talk a little bit more about whether there's any special efforts towards the primary care physician, are you expanding your touch with the primary care physicians or just how you're going after that market from the physician level, I guess, versus patients.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure, Danielle, and it's a great question, something we think a lot about. I think you're right, our success in the type two population does not rest on Omnipod 5. For the insulin-dependent type two user, we have an outstanding value proposition with Omnipod DASH. And you can see it in the adoption trajectory. We are uniquely differentiated in this space because of the simplicity of DASH, because of our market access position with DASH and because of our business model, and it's showing in the growth of that segment. And then I referenced the clinical data earlier. You add to that clinical outcomes and the data that was published this quarter, looking at those 3,600 patients and showing a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin and such an improvement in A1c, that's just really, really powerful. And so I think we -- I guess the other thing that we do is really address a recognized and frustrating compliance challenge that exists for the clinician and for the patient. And that's because of pods' form factor and simplicity. So I think at a high level, we believe that Omnipod has the potential to change how clinicians are thinking about therapy in insulin-dependent type two patients. And that's because of all the things that we know already, our simplicity, our user interface, but also the simplicity in access and prescribing. With no upfront cost, no lock-ins and for a physician, it's just a very easy e-script. And then clinicians and patients can try Omnipod for free. And that -- those are tactics all designed to change physician behavior and patient behavior. And we're having a lot of success with that in the Endo office today. But you're right, we also have begun to pilot new approaches in our messaging, in our education and in our physician targeting because we know there's there is such a huge opportunity and because we are so well positioned in it. So we're looking at our calls to action in DTC and how we target patients and clinicians. We're looking at piloting physician targeting of PCPs and looking at our training and support model. So all sorts of things. And I think ultimately, you're right to that awareness, both among people living with insulin-dependent type two and their clinicians. Awareness is really critical to continuing to unlock this opportunity. So I think the good news is we're having a lot of success today in the Endo office with Omnipod DASH. I think as you look to the future, there's even more exciting things on the horizon, both with Omnipod five and with our ability to move potentially into new physician segments.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: I'm trying to get some timing on a couple of things. Sort of out there is the pediatric label for Omnipod 5, the type two label for Omnipod five and then the integration with Abbot's Libre. Can you just -- if you want to get in quarters or even first half versus second half, sort of get us an idea of when you think we might be seeing those approvals?\nShacey Petrovic: Well, the one thing that we have given a time line publicly on is the pediatric label. And so all of our internal efforts on that front are on track. We have collected the data, finished the study, everything looks good, and we're getting ready to submit shortly to the FDA on that front. And so that would put us on track in a normal world, put us on track for a label expansion by the end of this year. Obviously, we do recognize, though, that we do have challenges today in terms of the workload and what the FDA is contending with. So I just caution everybody. We're on track on our end and working certainly hard to make that happen. We haven't given time lines yet on the Type two label indication or on Libre label indication. Just to indicate that, that work is underway. But to give you some sense of things, just remember that we are right now in a feasibility study for type 2, so the next step would be to move into a pivotal study. So there still is some clinical work to do before we're ready to submit to the FDA for the label expansion. And then Libre, what we've said is that work is underway. That will also include a submission to the FDA, but not any clinical work. So that just kind of gives you a sense of what's ahead of us. And we'll get more granular with our time lines once we have Omnipod five into full commercial release, which is 100,000% where most of the team is focused today.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Just two on my side, and I'll ask them up front. Just from a big picture perspective, it kind of feels like the company, and for that matter, the broader diabetes industry is kind of shifting more towards a software focus rather than just purely on the hardware side. I mean you've obviously got big investments there, and you've done a lot of work already when we think about DASH and the apps in the Omnipod five side. But just what other investments do you need to make from a software perspective for future projects? I'm just trying to understand how much of the investment has already been made versus some of the investments that need to be made in the future? And then with respect to the launch of O5, just any commentary around expectations for covered lives when you do move into the controlled launch? And how we should think about maybe the first 12, 18 months from a reimbursement perspective?\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Kyle, both good questions. So first on software. This has been a significant focus and it's funny because we say software, other people say digital. There's actually a lot included in that. When we think about software, we're thinking, obviously, about software developers. But we think about cybersecurity, we think about interfacing with consumer devices and obviously, our sensor partners and potentially other diabetes technologies. We obviously think about mobile technology, cloud computing and data science. So there's just a lot wrapped into that. We mentioned last year, we doubled our product development headcount and most -- or teams and most of that doubling took place, in fact, virtually all of it took place in some sort of software function. So we have been building rapidly. And I think I look back and think about where we are in our in these final stages of the clearance for Omnipod 5. And I think it's so great we made these investments, and we've built such dramatic capabilities here because it is a moat for others behind us to get really good at remote insulin delivery from either a PDM and/or mobile phones. Those are not easy to do. And then obviously, all of the integrations with our partners. I wouldn't say we're done. This is an area that will be continued investment for us for quite some time to come. We have no shortage of really exciting disruptive innovation programs ahead of us, and we will continue to invest here. And we've always said we'll get a little bit more maybe public about what those programs might look like as we think about once we've got Omnipod five into full market release. But areas of investment for us are, for example, continuing to advance our algorithms because that will provide ease of use, more automation and better outcomes continuing to interface with, obviously, additional sensors but also additional phone platforms, continuing to build value in digital. So things like data, insights and decision support and serving up, generating insights for patients, payers and clinicians. Just as some examples. So we've got work going on in all those areas. And I don't think that's going to slow down anytime soon, and we'll continue to build capabilities there. And then the second question around Omnipod five and covered lives. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the teams are doing a great job here. We're really encouraged by the discussions that have been being had by payers. We're definitely educating the pharmacy channel for the first time on automated insulin delivery and the value of Omnipod 5. Those conversations are going well. We already have some coverage established. And as we've always said, as the clinical data gets published, we expect more coverage. And then, of course, on clearance, we expect more coverage. And so we're building -- we're right where we expect to be at this point. Really, really delighted with the team's work and really optimistic that we're going to launch with a decent coverage position. And also build very rapidly from there. So that -- and all of our tactics are really designed to make that happen. The ones that I mentioned in my script around leveraging the data, pricing at parity, all of that is designed to make sure that we establish rapid access.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital.\nRavi Misra: So I guess I just want to step back to the broader diabetes landscape, if I may, for a second. Becton announced that it's spinning off its business this morning in the diabetes world. And just looking at their revenue numbers and their kind of focus, can you maybe think about or maybe help us think about how you think about kind of where we are progressing as an industry? I mean, to me, I would think perhaps it's a signal that pumps are the way given that this is a business with flattish revenue focused on needles. But just curious to see how you guys are thinking about it up there.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes, Ravi, good question. I mean I think you're right. We certainly believe and we've been very public about our belief that this market will double and that we're going to take a very exciting position in this fast-growing market and that is being driven by so many things. We've talked about what's been happening with CGM adoption. It's actually almost breathtaking when you look back five years and think about what's happened to the blood glucose monitoring business and what's happened with CGM. It's been a pretty remarkable transformation in the market and the value of real-time CGM data and what that has meant in terms of technology integration and technology adoption among pump therapy. And that is, I would say, still maturing in type one and at the very, very early stages in type 2. And so I do think, potentially, you could look at that move as just an endorsement of where the market is heading from a pump utilization, technology utilization perspective, both CGM and pumps, really when you look at their business. And I think we feel very well positioned in terms of specifically patch pumps. There's been a lot of activity out there, players trying to get into patch pumps. BD is one of them. And so I think it also points to how hard what we do is and how well positioned we are. And when you think about the challenge it takes to do something like we do with Omnipod, just the incredible investment that it takes to serve this market, it is about our IP position. It is about the incredible manufacturing capability. But it's also about what it takes to serve the commercial market and build the brand and create awareness, et cetera. And that's an area where a player, for example, like BD just didn't have a strong commercial presence there. So I think it's -- from our perspective, we feel very well positioned in a market that is growing very rapidly. And that's going to happen, I think, explosively in type 1, and we're just at the beginning stages in type 2. So it's a long tail from here, and we feel very well positioned in that space.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Quick two part t question on Omnipod 5. I guess, is there a way to maybe sort of look at the existing Omnipod user base and how it's segmented between BGM and CGM? And how do you see those individual patient populations over time gravitating to O5. Does one trend faster than the other? Or does everyone sort of converge on an integrated basis? And then if you have any early opinion on retention specifically, how do you see retention on O5 versus a stand-alone Omnipod user trending once the cycle begins?\nShacey Petrovic: Great. Thanks, Anthony. So maybe I'll take the retention one first, just to say that our retention has been very stable. So I think that's a great thing, just especially when you think about how dynamic the market is with new innovations coming. It's great to see that our retention has been stable. And I would expect that to likely be the same with Omnipod 5, primarily because we have done so much work on the access front. And because we're focused on establishing broad affordable access for Omnipod 5, we know that, that is one of the major reasons for people trading off the product as tied to access and cost. And so we have prioritized that with DASH, frankly, and then now with Omnipod 5. And I believe that's one of the drivers behind the stability in our retention for patients. As it relates to our user base and who's going to convert more quickly, BGM or CGM users, we certainly see CGM users as a very logical target for this. And we've said in the past, that's about half of our population. So that's great. But honestly, I think this product is going to be a winner with our patient-based period. There's a lot of exciting benefits around phone control, et cetera. And when I think about what's been happening with our user base, CGM adoption has grown very rapidly. So every day, that number ticks up a little bit and then that target population becomes even bigger for Omnipod 5. And that's certainly the trend across the United States. And so we've got a really big, exciting target for Omnipod five and a really exciting product to bring to those people. \nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Korinne on for Matt. So just on the 30-day trial that you're doing, how quickly do you think that will shift over to Omnipod 5? Will that be immediately once you launch it? Are you still going to be using DASH for a little bit? And then just on that topic as well, how many patients are you seeing actually stay on Omnipod after doing this trial? Is there a way to quantify that yet?\nShacey Petrovic: Yes. Korinne, great question. So we won't stop doing 30 Days of Freedom for DASH. This is part of our great position that we have with our business model to be able to essentially sample the product where others can't. And so it's a tactic to help drive more people who are sitting on multiple daily injections, injecting themselves four to five times a day, really be able to get over the hurdle of trying a new technology. It's been wildly successful for us. The vast majority of people who use the 30 Days of Freedom trial stay on the product. So it's been a successful tactic for us and one we will continue. And we will likely offer that once we move into full market release. So once we have broader access established for Omnipod five is when we will start to offer that with Omnipod 5. But we'll offer it with both. Remember that Omnipod five is indicated for type 1. We still anticipate great utilization and growth among certain type one segments as well as obviously the type two user. And so we'll offer them both free trials.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.\nMatt Taylor: I just had one on phasing. We know that the pandemic depression of new starts is still having an impact here in Q2, but now you've had a couple of quarters of record new starts. Could you just help us think about how that will start to roll in? And does that help you start to inflect more here in the second half? And any other nuances to help understand the gating over the quarters?\nWayde McMillan: Yes, Matt. And it is a unique dynamic with our annuity model. And so it definitely makes sense to spend a little more time on that. And you're referencing the U.S., first of all, I would say, just at the high level, we do think that we're through the majority of the pandemic impact in the U.S. We turned the corner at the end of 2020. And we're now, as you said, in more of an acceleration mode. We had record new customer starts in Q4. Again, here a record for Q1 in the U.S. And so what that positions us for is the strong 23% growth in Q1 with a very tough comp in Q2, still in the high-teens, 20% range. But what that does specific to your question, Matt, is it positions us for that 24% to 28% growth rate in the second half and starts to get us into the high-20% growth rates. And we haven't been in the 30% growth rate since before the pandemic. A couple of quarters before the pandemic, we were 30%. As the annuity continues to build here, we're confident that we'll get into the mid- to high-20s. And then just to touch on international because it is a different dynamic. I mentioned earlier, pandemic persisting longer. And so we will take a little longer to build the momentum back up again internationally. But we've got confidence that we'll do that and we expect international to be high-teens, low-20s nearing the end of this year and after we get on the other side of the pandemic next year. \nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nShacey Petrovic: Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. There is just so much to be excited about at Insulet, and there's much more we can and will accomplish for our customers. We have passionate employees, transformative innovations and a differentiated business model to continue to displace legacy therapies and to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Thank you all, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference call. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thank you, Shacey. We continue to execute at a high level and look forward to the limited market release of Omnipod 5. Our strategic imperatives are supported by continued investments across our business to drive long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. We delivered 24% revenue growth in the first quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong total Omnipod growth of 19%. As we previously discussed, the pandemic's impact on global new customer starts in 2020 will have a compounding impact in 2021, primarily in the first half. While the pandemic is persisting globally with ongoing challenges mainly throughout Europe and Canada, we are navigating them well and driving continued growth. In the U.S., our new customer starts were a record for any Q1 in our history, and second only to the very strong Q4 we achieved last year. We accomplished this while also driving strong international performance. In Q1, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23%, benefiting from our growing customer base, Omnipod DASH adoption and ongoing mix benefit as we shift volume into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH continues to ramp and drove over 70% of our U.S. new customer starts. In addition, we grew pharmacy channel volume to approximately 45% of our total U.S. volume. This is up significantly compared to last year, representing a meaningful increase and contributing to our top line growth. Expanding our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel remains a key strategic imperative as we plan to drive increased access for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod five once launched. International Omnipod revenue grew 13%, ahead of our expectations. Performance was driven primarily from our expanding customer base and ability to navigate through COVID-19-related challenges. The full launch of Omnipod DASH throughout our international markets last year is helping to drive growth this year as the majority of our international new customers start on Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH continues to generate physician interest and drive hospital access. To a smaller degree, international Omnipod revenue in Q1 also benefited from timing of PDM orders, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter given our distributor channels. We are also pleased that our global attrition and utilization once again were stable this past quarter. Drug delivery revenue more than doubled in line with our expectations. Growth was unusually high due to increased product demand this year versus the low production levels last year, which resulted from a slower than typical manufacturing start-up. Both of these drivers were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin was 66.4% in the first quarter, representing a 230 basis point increase or 120 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. Our gross margin expansion was driven primarily by improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, the ongoing benefit as we transition more volume into the pharmacy channel in the U.S. and a decrease in COVID-related mitigation costs. Partially offsetting these increases were the expected higher mix of costs as we continued to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $151 million, primarily due to our investments to support our innovation pipeline development efforts and the upcoming launch of Omnipod five as well as our broader direct-to-consumer advertising. Operating margin was 6.5%, up from 3.8% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, up from 12.3%, all were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're off to a great start in 2021 as both our diabetes product lines generated record performance, and we continued to invest across our organization to support our growth strategies and drive future expansion. This includes increasing advertising to drive brand awareness, and strengthening our commercial and R&D resources to support Omnipod five and our innovation pipeline as well as geographic expansion. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the first quarter with $850 million in cash and short-term investments. We recently completed a $500 million Term Loan B financing as well as a separate $60 million revolving line of credit. Our goal over the long term is to strengthen our access to traditional capital market financing, diversify our capital structure and over time, drive our gross leverage ratio down to 5 times bank EBITDA. This marked our first step and an important one in that direction. We plan to use the Term Loan B financing to pay down a portion of our outstanding convertible notes due 2024. This will lower our cost of capital while also maintaining flexibility to pursue future strategic investments. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 16% to 20%, up from prior 15% to 20%. This includes raising the low end of total Omnipod revenue guidance to 18% to 21%. In the U.S., we are raising the low end of full year Omnipod revenue growth to 22% to 25%. This will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth, the benefits of our efforts to drive expanded access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. Also driving growth is our expectation for further Omnipod customer adoption in both the type one and type two markets. We also expect growth will benefit to a lesser degree from the limited market release of Omnipod 5. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of full year 2021 guidance to 11% to 15%. In the near term, we continue to expect our international business to be impacted by the pandemic and related challenges, combined with the compounding impact on new customer starts from 2020. With that said, we are encouraged by the adoption rates of Omnipod DASH and our plan for driving expanded market penetration internationally. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revenue expectations for drug delivery in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect full year gross margin in the range of 67% to 70%. Our gross margin expansion drivers remain the same: increased scale and efficiencies provided by our global manufacturing operations and positive mix from the continued volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. We also benefit from a planned reduction in COVID-related mitigation and safety-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year as we invest in consumer-focused innovation and best position ourselves for increased market penetration. This includes investments in our sales and marketing teams ahead of the launch of Omnipod five and to support our international market initiatives. As a result of our strong revenue growth, combined with gross margin expansion and the investments we are making across our business, we are reaffirming operating margin for full year 2021 in the low double-digit range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. We expect operating margin will improve sequentially throughout the year. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021 as we further invest in our global manufacturing operations and strategic imperatives to support our strong growth expectations. Turning to our second quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 14%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 14% to 17%. We expect Q2 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 20%, driven primarily by our growing customer base fueled by Omnipod DASH volume growth and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q2 growth is impacted by the tough prior year comparison where we experienced a net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels at the start of the pandemic. We expect international Omnipod revenue growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the ongoing growth in our customer base from increased Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the headwind of lower new customer starts in 2020, stemming from the pandemic as well as the continued pandemic impacts throughout many of our international markets. Also, the benefit in Q1 from the timing of Omnipod DASH PDM orders is not expected to occur again in Q2. We also expect drug delivery revenue to decline 16% to 24% due to the normalization of order volumes in the current year as compared to elevated levels in the prior year due to the pandemic. In conclusion, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We remain on track for robust revenue growth and operating margin expansion continue to advance our strategic imperatives and are in a solid financial position to continue to invest for growth. We are building a foundation for long-term sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion and increased value creation for our stakeholders. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Robbie, yes, sounds good. And it's actually a really good question because there's quite a few dynamics rolling out. And I think diabetes does have some uniqueness to it. So why don't we think about it first in the U.S. and what we've seen in the U.S. is really at the end of 2020, we saw the access to customers and the market really start to turn. We're still dealing with some pandemic issues in the U.S., but we really saw it start to level out in the end of Q4 '20 and obviously, with a 23% growth rate here in the quarter start to pick up. One thing we've talked about in the past that was unexpected was we thought we would see seasonality change a little bit more in Q1 in -- moved into the pharmacy. We have 45% of our volume in the pharmacy now and we really didn't see that. So that was kind of a unique impact. And we think it's really due to the fact that customers still have buying patterns that are related to the legacy market paradigm here in diabetes and the traditional order patterns of buying more in Q4 as well as people throughout the value chain, distributors, wholesalers, even physicians thinking about prescribing pumps at the end of the year versus the start of the year. So I think it's going to take more time than we expected to see some of those seasonal trends take place. And as we think about the rest of the year for the U.S., I mean, really strong. We think we've got a strong guide for the second half, and we start to build momentum. Just a reminder that we do have an annuity model here at Insulet. And so we start to build momentum. We had a record Q1 start -- new customer starts here. We had a record Q4 in 2020. So you put those two together, and we're starting to build momentum up again and you see that start to build in our growth rate here in the second half. That's implied in our guide. And then internationally, it's a different story. We are seeing the pandemic persist. It was longer and more difficult through the end of 2020. And we can see that as it rolls into our annuity model here in the first half of 2021. And so we'll see that persist longer internationally. Having said that, we still feel we had a pretty strong growth rate, 13% in the face of the challenges that the team has seen internationally. And just to highlight a couple of the things we're dealing with. We're -- our business is concentrated in a few of the larger regions like the U.K. and France. And those are the regions where we've seen more lockdowns and more persistence of the pandemic. And so when some of those regions are more challenged, it's harder for our teams to get in and get customers started on new product. But I mentioned in the prepared remarks, where we are seeing good traction is a lot of interest in our new DASH product, and so that is giving our teams reasons to meet with physicians and with customers. And so we are starting to see signs of improvement internationally as well. We do think it will persist a little longer into the second half, and that's reflected in our growth rates. At the high end of our growth rates, we get up to that 17% range. And as you know, our expectations for the region are high-teens, low-20s. So optimistically, if we see the pandemic start to calm down internationally as well, we'll start to get back into that high-teens growth rate. 35% to 40%. Yes. Marissa, I think you've got most of it. I would just highlight one of the things I called out in the prepared remarks was the tough comp we have, and that's because of the inventory build we saw last year in Q2 at the start of the pandemic. That's about a 5% impact to the growth rate. So if you add -- if you just add that tough comp for the inventory last year, that puts us into the mid-20s, even above the Q1 growth rate and so that's in there. But as you mentioned, there's also some dynamics between Q1 and Q2. The pharmacy channel, we're still learning. It's still new to us and we're still monitoring it and to see how that plays out. But another way to think about Q2 for us is we have -- at the high end of our guide, a similar sequential dollar growth rate, $12 million growth rate, same as we experienced last year. So that's another thing to ground on. We'll see how it goes. We're also closely watching the pandemic in the U.S. We're not free and clear of that yet, and the teams are doing a great job selling through it. Our virtual training capabilities are really helping us here. And we'll see how that continues to play out in the U.S. We're very optimistic with vaccine rollout across the U.S. and things continued to improve. And again, if you normalize for the growth rate that puts us into that mid-20s. And then our implied growth rate in the U.S. for the second half is mid to high-20s. And so in an annuity model, just a reminder for everybody, it takes several quarters to build up the new customer starts. Last year, Q2 for us was a low new customer start quarter, but we still had 30% growth because of the momentum coming into the quarter. So we're excited here to be building momentum again, setting record new customer start quarters. And if we can continue to do that, you'll see the growth rates climb into that guidance -- implied guidance of high 20% growth rates in the second half. Jayson, it's Wayde. I can take that one. Well, first of all, international was above the high end of the range and the U.S. was right at the high end of the range. So there wasn't anything too much to really complain about, as you said. The one thing that was a little surprising to us is we were expecting some more favorable seasonality in Q1 in the pharmacy channel. Now that we've got 45% of our volume rolling through there. It was a small thing, but that was one thing that we are expecting to see. And we do think that will continue to develop, it just may take a few years to change behavior, not just for customers but all through the value chain. But other than that, as you know, Jayson, we've got a lot of new things going on in both regions, but in particular in the U.S., the pay-as-you-go model is still relatively new. Our move into type two is new. The DTC campaigns are new. Even DASH uptake is still accelerating for us. So as we think about guidance, we've got a lot of puts and takes, and we're very happy still dealing with the pandemic to print the 23% growth rate. On a dollar basis, I think the strongest of all the companies out there and we're continuing to expand our leadership position. And so I think as we're approaching $1 billion, our growth rates don't look as impressive as some others, but we're happy to be growing stronger on a dollar basis. Yes, Matt. And it is a unique dynamic with our annuity model. And so it definitely makes sense to spend a little more time on that. And you're referencing the U.S., first of all, I would say, just at the high level, we do think that we're through the majority of the pandemic impact in the U.S. We turned the corner at the end of 2020. And we're now, as you said, in more of an acceleration mode. We had record new customer starts in Q4. Again, here a record for Q1 in the U.S. And so what that positions us for is the strong 23% growth in Q1 with a very tough comp in Q2, still in the high-teens, 20% range. But what that does specific to your question, Matt, is it positions us for that 24% to 28% growth rate in the second half and starts to get us into the high-20% growth rates. And we haven't been in the 30% growth rate since before the pandemic. A couple of quarters before the pandemic, we were 30%. As the annuity continues to build here, we're confident that we'll get into the mid- to high-20s. And then just to touch on international because it is a different dynamic. I mentioned earlier, pandemic persisting longer. And so we will take a little longer to build the momentum back up again internationally. But we've got confidence that we'll do that and we expect international to be high-teens, low-20s nearing the end of this year and after we get on the other side of the pandemic next year."

            "name": "Shacey Petrovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are off to a strong start to the year, with first quarter revenue growth of 24%. Both our U.S. and international diabetes product lines achieved solid results with total Omnipod growth of 19%. We are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We have sustained momentum across our business, and we are preparing for the highly anticipated launch of Omnipod 5. We continue to execute at a high level, which speaks to the strength of our team and our deep commitment to Insulet's mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During the first quarter, we advanced each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Let's begin with access and awareness and how Omnipod remains well positioned to further eliminate access barriers and displace legacy therapies. The progress we've made to date is largely due to the differentiated customer experience Omnipod provides, our tubeless form factor, simple user interface, unique business model and expanding presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. There are millions of people around the globe living with diabetes, and yet this population is critically underserved. There are far too many people that either don't have access to Omnipod, are unaware of our product, or in some cases, both. This must change as Omnipod can simplify lives and deliver improved outcomes. The value Omnipod provides is clearly demonstrated by our ability to drive new customer growth from multiple daily injection users in the type one and type two segments. Approximately 80% of our new customers switch from MDI to Omnipod. Additionally, in the first quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new U.S. customers were type 2. Much of this growth has been driven by Omnipod DASH, which offers tremendous benefits compared to existing therapies. As a result, we continue to transition a growing percentage of our U.S. pod volume through our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. This provides increased access for customers, low co-pays and no upfront costs or multiyear lock-in periods. It simplifies access, making Omnipod easier to prescribe for physicians, provides a number of benefits to payers and drives our recurring revenue. Today, our technology and form factors stand at the forefront of innovation, while our U.S. pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model are eliminating long-standing access barriers. This combination uniquely positions Insulet to further penetrate both the type one and type two insulin intensive markets. By the end of Q1, we had secured coverage for over 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, and the majority of our new customers across the globe start on Omnipod DASH. At the same time, we are focused on expanding Omnipod awareness, given the diabetes market is large, yet critically underserved. Last year, we launched our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the United States. The reaction to date has been positive, and we have already started to see incremental new customer starts. We have also begun to pilot DTC in the United Kingdom. It is early days for both our domestic and international campaigns. But we know there is tremendous opportunity to help more people across the globe learn about the life-changing benefits of Omnipod. Driving access and awareness are core components of our growth strategy and complement our commitment to delivering market-leading innovation. We believe the combination of enhanced access and superior innovation, improves outcomes and makes living with diabetes or caring for loved ones less burdensome. All of this has resulted in consistently strong Omnipod adoption and customer retention and a global customer base that surpassed 0.25 million people in Q1. We accomplished this despite not having an AID product in the market, and this will soon change with our Omnipod five automated insulin delivery system, which we believe is the future of insulin delivery. Omnipod five unlocks a new level of freedom and simplicity through easier insulin management and significantly improved glucose control. The number of firsts Omnipod five brings to market is compelling. It is the first tubeless, entirely wearable AID system with a personalized, adaptive on-target algorithm embedded in every pod. This means there is no need to disconnect or interrupt therapy other than the few minutes it takes to change a pod every three days. This is critical as interruptions in continuous insulin delivery lead to suboptimal outcomes. Managing diabetes will be easier and more discrete as Omnipod five customers will have complete smartphone control for all system functions. At launch, we will offer full control from personal Android smartphones and every customer will also receive a controller that includes a SIM card. This marks another important distinction between Omnipod five and other options available in the market. No other AID system offers real-time connectivity, even when not near WiFi and real-time remote monitoring through SIM and personal phone control. Omnipod five users will always be able to view their data on their smartphones and loved ones will always be able to know how their Podders are doing in real time on the Omnipod five VIEW app. Omnipod five is the only system with customizable glucose targets for different times of day and also a hypo protect feature that can be used in times of greater hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, our AID system is the only one to provide a smart bolus calculator that recommends more or less insulin based on a user's CGM trend, not just the CGM value alone. All of this while maintaining the same form factor our customers love. We are confident that Omnipod five will mark a major improvement in quality of life and diabetes management. In the U.S., Omnipod five will be available only through the pharmacy channel. We'll utilize our unique pay-as-you-go model and will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. As a result, the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod five should be comparable to both Omnipod DASH and MDI. Like Omnipod DASH, we expect the majority of Omnipod five customers in the U.S. to have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50. In addition, through our 30 Days of Freedom trial, anyone can try Omnipod five free for 30 days. Our goal is to quickly secure broad affordable coverage and expanded access. We believe the broad coverage we have established for Omnipod DASH will continue to serve as a major competitive advantage and a strong foundation for our efforts to drive access to Omnipod 5. Although Omnipod five has breakthrough device designation and the FDA has been incredibly supportive and collaborative throughout its review process, the clearance time line is taking longer than we had anticipated. The feedback we have received to date has been in line with our expectations, and we remain optimistic that we will receive Omnipod five clearance by the end of June or shortly thereafter. But given the current environment and the associated lengthened review time, clearance could shift into the second half of the year. As a result, we now expect to begin our limited commercial release in the second half of 2021. We do not expect this will have a material impact on revenue guidance, and our internal teams are certainly not standing still. We are building Omnipod five inventory. We are developing commercial launch materials and testing our systems and processes, and we are securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Our teams are geared up for what we fully expect will be the best technology and customer experience on the market and a wildly successful launch. The value Omnipod five offers to people with diabetes was clearly demonstrated via the impressive pivotal data we shared in March at ENDO 2021. Our pivotal study included children and adults ages six to 70. Compared to standard therapy, Omnipod five achieved significantly higher time and range and improved A1c while maintaining or lowering hyperglycemia. After three months on Omnipod 5, 53% of children and 66% of adults achieved an A1c of less than 7%. Time and range for children increased 16 points to 68%, while timing range for adults and adolescents increased nine points to 74%. Additionally, time in hypoglycemia was reduced for adults and remained very low in children. Omnipod five will offer meaningful value for individuals living with diabetes as well as for their families, physicians and payers. It's a clear testament to our innovation team that we were able to achieve this very competitive time in range, while also delivering the strongest published hypoglycemia performance. We have additional Omnipod five abstracts accepted for presentation at upcoming diabetes conferences in June. These address a number of important areas, including performance in preschool aged children, the transition from multiple daily injections directly on to Omnipod five and quality of life outcomes. Also on the clinical front, we had impactful domestic and international data recently published in several leading peer-reviewed diabetes journals. Collectively, the results shared in these publications demonstrate that Omnipod can drive improved outcomes across a broad range of people living with either type one or type two diabetes. These improved outcomes span multiple age groups and disease states as well as people coming from different forms of therapy. We continue to invest clinically and have a compelling road map, including our work to expand our Omnipod five indication to preschoolers down to H2 and to secure a type two indication. The first phase of our preschool study is complete, and we are progressing well through our planned 12-month extension phase, which allows us to collect longer durable outcomes and allows our trial participants to continue on Omnipod 5, which they all elected to do. Additionally, our type two feasibility study is now fully enrolled and the results are illuminating. During ENDO 2021, Dr. Bruce Bode presented early data from our type two study that showed encouraging results for Omnipod 5, with time and range that more than doubled in the first eight weeks. The type two diabetes market offers tremendous opportunity for Insulet, and we will continue to innovate to further penetrate this largely underserved population. The depth and breadth of the clinical data published and presented in just this last quarter demonstrates our commitment to building strong clinical evidence that supports how Omnipod will continue to improve outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We continue to advance our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing additional clinical data in the future. Omnipod five is our top innovation priority. However, we are diligently working to advance a robust pipeline that extends well beyond. We know that our success over the long term requires leadership in critical areas such as software development, data science and other core competencies. This includes the integration of Omnipod five and our future products with next generations of products by Dexcom and Abbott. Beyond Omnipod 5, we have begun product development on innovations that we believe will offer significant value to people living with both type one and type two diabetes. Moving to global expansion. We are expanding access and awareness of Omnipod in a number of attractive markets. Last year, we entered five new countries within Europe and the Middle East. This quarter, we expanded into Turkey, and we continued to gear up for an expected launch in Australia later this year. Our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market. Across our current footprint, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We see attractive future expansion opportunities that will further grow our total addressable market and bring our technology to people living with diabetes around the world. The international launch of Omnipod DASH has been highly successful and work is underway to bring Omnipod five to our international markets. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly in our global manufacturing operations. We are well positioned to meet growing consumer demand for Omnipod DASH as well as the commercial launch of Omnipod 5, our broader innovation pipeline and our future international expansion plans. Operational excellence is one of our key strategic imperatives that is enabling growth today and will do so well into the future. As part of this strategy, Insulet is committed to responsible and sustainable growth. We have developed a comprehensive sustainability strategy that builds upon our existing capabilities, provides value to our stakeholders and considers the most important ESG issues that affect our business, society and planet. We recently published our 2020 sustainability report, which outlines our commitment to addressing important ESG issues and highlights our key priorities. All of us at Insulet are dedicated to a business resiliency and responsible business practices that help our customers, our employees and our communities thrive. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, launch Omnipod five and advance our innovation pipeline to continue to bring life-changing innovations to people with diabetes in order to simplify and improve their lives. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Well, I think it's true. It's kind of an industry-wide thing. Like others, we are experiencing the longer-than-expected review process. I don't believe this is due to anything but just the workload, frankly, at the agency. And we're really sensitive to that. They have done an incredible job navigating through all of the challenges related to the pandemic. Our local team, our review team has been incredibly responsive and collaborative. And so we feel very good about where we are, we're in the final stages of this review process. And I don't believe that there's any sort of any other drivers outside of the workload tied to the pandemic. In fact, we gave ourselves quite a bit of buffer in the time line. And so my remarks are really prompted by the fact that we're getting through that buffer. And so the review process is taking a bit longer than we expected. But we're in the final stages and feel good about where we are. Yes. Larry, great questions. I'll start with the first one. We actually haven't really seen a change in utilization that is noticeable at the population level between type two and type 1. And I think that comes down to a reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And in fact, we mentioned this in the press release, but we had some incredible data published this last quarter, most recently -- or on type two rather, the data was published in diabetes research and clinical practice. And this looked at almost 3,600 patients and demonstrated statistically significant reduction in A1c, but maybe even more surprisingly a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And that was regardless of which therapy they were coming from multiple daily injections or previous pump therapy. So I think that points to the value of Omnipod and site rotation among other things, and it's probably playing out in the patient experience out there, which is why we don't see, broadly, utilization increasing in the population. It was steady this quarter. And then the other question that you had, on type 2... Was 35% to 40%. It actually has ticked up every quarter. It's just a broad range. So it is growing, and it is probably growing faster than our total new customers, which are growing quickly as well. Sure, Brandon. Thank you for the question. And yes, as I mentioned, this has been an area of focus for us. We're really excited about the early data that Dr. Bruce Bode presented at ENDO. And we believe that the data was very positive so far with our feasibility study. So we will take this data and if it remains positive as we close out the feasibility data, we will be able to move into a pivotal. But we'll sort of reserve the right to potentially make changes to the algorithm depending on the final results that we get out of our feasibility study. But so far, so good. The data is really encouraging to date. Sure, Danielle, and it's a great question, something we think a lot about. I think you're right, our success in the type two population does not rest on Omnipod 5. For the insulin-dependent type two user, we have an outstanding value proposition with Omnipod DASH. And you can see it in the adoption trajectory. We are uniquely differentiated in this space because of the simplicity of DASH, because of our market access position with DASH and because of our business model, and it's showing in the growth of that segment. And then I referenced the clinical data earlier. You add to that clinical outcomes and the data that was published this quarter, looking at those 3,600 patients and showing a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin and such an improvement in A1c, that's just really, really powerful. And so I think we -- I guess the other thing that we do is really address a recognized and frustrating compliance challenge that exists for the clinician and for the patient. And that's because of pods' form factor and simplicity. So I think at a high level, we believe that Omnipod has the potential to change how clinicians are thinking about therapy in insulin-dependent type two patients. And that's because of all the things that we know already, our simplicity, our user interface, but also the simplicity in access and prescribing. With no upfront cost, no lock-ins and for a physician, it's just a very easy e-script. And then clinicians and patients can try Omnipod for free. And that -- those are tactics all designed to change physician behavior and patient behavior. And we're having a lot of success with that in the Endo office today. But you're right, we also have begun to pilot new approaches in our messaging, in our education and in our physician targeting because we know there's there is such a huge opportunity and because we are so well positioned in it. So we're looking at our calls to action in DTC and how we target patients and clinicians. We're looking at piloting physician targeting of PCPs and looking at our training and support model. So all sorts of things. And I think ultimately, you're right to that awareness, both among people living with insulin-dependent type two and their clinicians. Awareness is really critical to continuing to unlock this opportunity. So I think the good news is we're having a lot of success today in the Endo office with Omnipod DASH. I think as you look to the future, there's even more exciting things on the horizon, both with Omnipod five and with our ability to move potentially into new physician segments. Well, the one thing that we have given a time line publicly on is the pediatric label. And so all of our internal efforts on that front are on track. We have collected the data, finished the study, everything looks good, and we're getting ready to submit shortly to the FDA on that front. And so that would put us on track in a normal world, put us on track for a label expansion by the end of this year. Obviously, we do recognize, though, that we do have challenges today in terms of the workload and what the FDA is contending with. So I just caution everybody. We're on track on our end and working certainly hard to make that happen. We haven't given time lines yet on the Type two label indication or on Libre label indication. Just to indicate that, that work is underway. But to give you some sense of things, just remember that we are right now in a feasibility study for type 2, so the next step would be to move into a pivotal study. So there still is some clinical work to do before we're ready to submit to the FDA for the label expansion. And then Libre, what we've said is that work is underway. That will also include a submission to the FDA, but not any clinical work. So that just kind of gives you a sense of what's ahead of us. And we'll get more granular with our time lines once we have Omnipod five into full commercial release, which is 100,000% where most of the team is focused today. Great. Kyle, both good questions. So first on software. This has been a significant focus and it's funny because we say software, other people say digital. There's actually a lot included in that. When we think about software, we're thinking, obviously, about software developers. But we think about cybersecurity, we think about interfacing with consumer devices and obviously, our sensor partners and potentially other diabetes technologies. We obviously think about mobile technology, cloud computing and data science. So there's just a lot wrapped into that. We mentioned last year, we doubled our product development headcount and most -- or teams and most of that doubling took place, in fact, virtually all of it took place in some sort of software function. So we have been building rapidly. And I think I look back and think about where we are in our in these final stages of the clearance for Omnipod 5. And I think it's so great we made these investments, and we've built such dramatic capabilities here because it is a moat for others behind us to get really good at remote insulin delivery from either a PDM and/or mobile phones. Those are not easy to do. And then obviously, all of the integrations with our partners. I wouldn't say we're done. This is an area that will be continued investment for us for quite some time to come. We have no shortage of really exciting disruptive innovation programs ahead of us, and we will continue to invest here. And we've always said we'll get a little bit more maybe public about what those programs might look like as we think about once we've got Omnipod five into full market release. But areas of investment for us are, for example, continuing to advance our algorithms because that will provide ease of use, more automation and better outcomes continuing to interface with, obviously, additional sensors but also additional phone platforms, continuing to build value in digital. So things like data, insights and decision support and serving up, generating insights for patients, payers and clinicians. Just as some examples. So we've got work going on in all those areas. And I don't think that's going to slow down anytime soon, and we'll continue to build capabilities there. And then the second question around Omnipod five and covered lives. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the teams are doing a great job here. We're really encouraged by the discussions that have been being had by payers. We're definitely educating the pharmacy channel for the first time on automated insulin delivery and the value of Omnipod 5. Those conversations are going well. We already have some coverage established. And as we've always said, as the clinical data gets published, we expect more coverage. And then, of course, on clearance, we expect more coverage. And so we're building -- we're right where we expect to be at this point. Really, really delighted with the team's work and really optimistic that we're going to launch with a decent coverage position. And also build very rapidly from there. So that -- and all of our tactics are really designed to make that happen. The ones that I mentioned in my script around leveraging the data, pricing at parity, all of that is designed to make sure that we establish rapid access. Sure. Yes, Ravi, good question. I mean I think you're right. We certainly believe and we've been very public about our belief that this market will double and that we're going to take a very exciting position in this fast-growing market and that is being driven by so many things. We've talked about what's been happening with CGM adoption. It's actually almost breathtaking when you look back five years and think about what's happened to the blood glucose monitoring business and what's happened with CGM. It's been a pretty remarkable transformation in the market and the value of real-time CGM data and what that has meant in terms of technology integration and technology adoption among pump therapy. And that is, I would say, still maturing in type one and at the very, very early stages in type 2. And so I do think, potentially, you could look at that move as just an endorsement of where the market is heading from a pump utilization, technology utilization perspective, both CGM and pumps, really when you look at their business. And I think we feel very well positioned in terms of specifically patch pumps. There's been a lot of activity out there, players trying to get into patch pumps. BD is one of them. And so I think it also points to how hard what we do is and how well positioned we are. And when you think about the challenge it takes to do something like we do with Omnipod, just the incredible investment that it takes to serve this market, it is about our IP position. It is about the incredible manufacturing capability. But it's also about what it takes to serve the commercial market and build the brand and create awareness, et cetera. And that's an area where a player, for example, like BD just didn't have a strong commercial presence there. So I think it's -- from our perspective, we feel very well positioned in a market that is growing very rapidly. And that's going to happen, I think, explosively in type 1, and we're just at the beginning stages in type 2. So it's a long tail from here, and we feel very well positioned in that space. Great. Thanks, Anthony. So maybe I'll take the retention one first, just to say that our retention has been very stable. So I think that's a great thing, just especially when you think about how dynamic the market is with new innovations coming. It's great to see that our retention has been stable. And I would expect that to likely be the same with Omnipod 5, primarily because we have done so much work on the access front. And because we're focused on establishing broad affordable access for Omnipod 5, we know that, that is one of the major reasons for people trading off the product as tied to access and cost. And so we have prioritized that with DASH, frankly, and then now with Omnipod 5. And I believe that's one of the drivers behind the stability in our retention for patients. As it relates to our user base and who's going to convert more quickly, BGM or CGM users, we certainly see CGM users as a very logical target for this. And we've said in the past, that's about half of our population. So that's great. But honestly, I think this product is going to be a winner with our patient-based period. There's a lot of exciting benefits around phone control, et cetera. And when I think about what's been happening with our user base, CGM adoption has grown very rapidly. So every day, that number ticks up a little bit and then that target population becomes even bigger for Omnipod 5. And that's certainly the trend across the United States. And so we've got a really big, exciting target for Omnipod five and a really exciting product to bring to those people. Yes. Korinne, great question. So we won't stop doing 30 Days of Freedom for DASH. This is part of our great position that we have with our business model to be able to essentially sample the product where others can't. And so it's a tactic to help drive more people who are sitting on multiple daily injections, injecting themselves four to five times a day, really be able to get over the hurdle of trying a new technology. It's been wildly successful for us. The vast majority of people who use the 30 Days of Freedom trial stay on the product. So it's been a successful tactic for us and one we will continue. And we will likely offer that once we move into full market release. So once we have broader access established for Omnipod five is when we will start to offer that with Omnipod 5. But we'll offer it with both. Remember that Omnipod five is indicated for type 1. We still anticipate great utilization and growth among certain type one segments as well as obviously the type two user. And so we'll offer them both free trials. Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. There is just so much to be excited about at Insulet, and there's much more we can and will accomplish for our customers. We have passionate employees, transformative innovations and a differentiated business model to continue to displace legacy therapies and to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Thank you all, and have a great evening."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations.  Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q4, the global Insulet team delivered another record quarter of growth, which was a strong end cap to a remarkable 2022. We exceeded our expectations once again, achieving revenue growth of 45% in the U.S. and over 35% for total Omnipod and our U.S. and global new customer starts were at record levels. And 2022 marked our seventh consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth. This past year, we not only drove consistently strong financial performance, we also achieved a number of critical milestones. We now have roughly 360,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, including more than 100,000 customers on Omnipod 5. In fact, during Q4, Omnipod 5 represented over 90% of our U.S. new customer starts. This transformative technology is the leading offer in the market and is proving to be the obvious choice for consumers. The 2022 full market release of our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was a huge achievement. This is the product our company was founded to make. And we continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, adding CE Mark approval and quickly extending our label in the U.S. to include pediatric customers down to age 2 for Omnipod 5, as well as completing the 510(k) submission for our type 2 basal-only pod. During 2022, we also further strengthened our intellectual property mode representing a culmination of work throughout the year that should protect our innovation capabilities and opportunities for years to come. And we made notable advancements in our clinical efforts, including the recent publication of our first look at real-world evidence for Omnipod 5. I'll speak in more detail about the highlights of these accomplishments in a few minutes. I could not be more proud of everything the Insulet team has achieved in advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. And on top of everything we've achieved during 2022, I am confident our best is yet to come. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched as an AID system. With Omnipod 5, we have delivered a number of market firsts -- it's the only tubeless waterproof pod-based AID system and the first to offer full compatible smartphone control with constant cloud-based connectivity -- this means doctors don't have to wait for data to be uploaded when or if a patient visits a physician. With Omnipod 5, customers no longer need to plug in their devices to access their data. Our smart bolus calculator helps patients manage their blood glucose levels and trends, and there are no other AID systems that include the adaptive algorithm that Omnipod 5 has. It works right out of the box and learns each customer's specific usage and then predict their trends and automatically personalizes their care. These all are competitive advantages that significantly improve and simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 continues to drive customer adoption from all market segments. MDI users are growing at the high end of our forecast as are those switching from competitive tube pumps. And the number of current Omnipod customer conversions are exceeding our expectations.  In Q4, the percentage of customers coming from MDI and traditional tube pumps was an estimated 65-35 split compared to our historical 80-20 mix due to significantly more competitive switches. This again speaks to the value Omnipod 5 brings to MDI and traditional tube pump users. We also continue to win back thousands of customers who had once been potters and returned to us in Q4 to adopt Omnipod 5. Adopters are coming from all age groups. Due to higher-than-expected demand for Omnipod 5, we increased investments in our support capabilities, primarily within our call centers. These investments have helped drive our customer and product support experience back to historical levels of excellence. This has included taking quick action to address certain complaints regarding the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 handheld devices. We previously announced the medical device correction for Omnipod 5 due to an issue with the controller charging port in cable. The FDA subsequently classified this as a Class 2 correction, and we are in the process of providing replacements to our customers upon request. With respect to the previously announced Omnipod DASH MDC, we expect to complete the replacement of personal diabetes managers within the coming months. I am proud of our global team's focus to ensure these corrective actions were executed with a sense of urgency and care. Consumer-focused innovation is central to everything we do. Omnipod 5 was designed with the user 100% in mind, and the results and feedback we receive speak to our shared success. One recent story from a mother of an 8-year-old with diabetes was particularly touching. She said, \" Omnipod 5 has given me my life back. I sleep through the night. I feel like me again. Diabetes has moved from the foreground to the background in our daily lives. This speaks to the power of Omnipod 5 and supports why we designed the product and the customer experience the way we did.  A critical element to our continued strong Omnipod growth is an unwavering commitment to expand access and awareness, and we're doing this through multiple initiatives. First is through our growing presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. With low co-pays and broad coverage, access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH is affordable and simpler, which helps drive adoption and makes Omnipod more attractive and accessible, especially during challenging economic times. Second, we priced Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH, resulting in our ability to meaningfully expand commercial coverage for Omnipod 5. By year-end, coverage approached 90% of U.S. lives. Additionally, because the vast majority of our U.S. customers pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, the cost is similar to multiple daily injections, even though our technology offers improved outcomes, glycemic control and quality of life. Our annuity business model and pharmacy access also benefit physicians and payers.  We have eliminated large upfront costs and lengthy lock-in periods. This offers real value to payers compared to traditional tubed pumps sold through the durable medical equipment channel. This is especially true when you consider that on average, individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years. I also want to share that we recently notified U.S. classic Omnipod customers about our plans to phase out that technology by the end of this year since the vast majority of our customer base no longer is on our legacy product. We value every classic Omnipod customer and will help them through their transition to either Omnipod 5 or Omnipod DASH. 2022 also was another exciting year for Insulet in terms of advancing our clinical efforts, and that momentum is carrying into 2023. We recently finalized our type 2 pivotal study protocol with the FDA and received IDE approval. We plan to begin enrollment in the 3-month study in the coming weeks. This will be the largest clinical study we've conducted to date and rolling up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes from 20 sites across the U.S. There will be a targeted focus to recruit diverse and underserved populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 also opens up new avenues for clinical evidence. Yesterday, at ATTD, we shared the first release of real-world evidence for Omnipod 5 with data from more than 31,000 people using the system for at least 3 months. This kind of data is unmatched by competitors and gives us valuable insights into how people use the product and the outcomes they're achieving. We're able to see which device settings contribute to maximum time in range and minimal hypoglycemia. The data demonstrated glycemic results in line with those observed in our pivotal trials and also reinforced the benefits of our customizable target glucose settings. These are some of the reasons why Omnipod 5 will be a market leader for years to come. Our enthusiasm is shared by a health care practitioner who recently said the Omnipod 5 real-world data set is striking and that it includes all users since everyone is connected to the cloud-based system. With this large sample and limited selection bias, we see strong time in target range and minimal time below range exceeding glycemic targets on average. This is extremely promising for long-term benefit in the real world. Our real-world data for Omnipod 5 will be incredibly powerful over time since every user is cloud connected. For patients, this means we can continue to personalize and improve the overall experience. For physicians, this means we will be able to streamline their workflows. Over time, our intention is to tie that usage data to claims data to further drive Omnipod 5 adoption as well as build a host of other enhancements such as population-based health management for payers. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy. This means that we will have unprecedented insights into actual population level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and build on our already market-leading product differentiation. While we are thrilled with the market response to Omnipod 5, winning in the global diabetes market requires a commitment to innovation. Today, we have a strong innovation pipeline that includes our type 2 basal-only pod, future AID offerings and digital and data capabilities. Today, our unique form factor and access model are helping us win in the type 2 population in addition to type 1. We deliver a market-leading experience. And as a result, in Q4, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our new U.S. customer starts. We expect to build on our leading competitive position in this market as well as expand our total addressable market with the planned 2024 commercialization of our new basal-only pod. This will be a unique product for the type 2 market and will provide us with early entry into the treatment experience and help patients become comfortable with the Omnipod on-body experience. We believe this innovation will offer users a clear pathway to adopt Omnipod 5 as their insulin needs progress. We estimate the total addressable market for our basal-only pod is approximately 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We are also making great headway in our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems, and our iOS integration efforts continue to progress very well. We offer the best AID system on the market today and our future generations of technology, including CGM of choice, will continue to strengthen our leading value proposition. To continue to deliver our unique and leading technologies, a key priority for us is our intellectual property. We have significantly expanded our patent portfolio over the last few years. And in this past year, we more than doubled it both organically and through record patent filings and an acquisition. We acquired the pump and AID patent portfolio of Bigfoot Biomedical, including approximately 400 patents and a large number of global patent applications. Over many years, Big Food has developed a strong patent library covering areas such as closed loop technology, smartphone control, secure communications and improved user experience innovations. Our acquisition of these patent assets add significant strength to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a mutual agreement with Medtronic not to assert our patents at each other for certain diabetes technologies. With certain exclusions, this agreement applies to both companies' existing products as well as new products commercialized over the next 7 years and does not permit cloning each other's products. The agreement replaces an earlier one and provides more certainty around covered products and the agreement's duration. Through these efforts, we have created a broad and deep IP moat that positions us incredibly well to build upon our current leading innovative platform and continue to grow our expanding innovation pipeline. Moving on to our international operations. We had a solid year of double-digit revenue growth, even with the ongoing impact of AID competition. We expect to begin to offset those headwinds in 2023 with the launch of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. midyear and in Germany towards the end of this year, marking the beginning of our staged international rollout. We plan to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly internationally during 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities continue to support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. While macro conditions remain challenging, we continue to support our growing global customer base and the strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our operations team has worked tirelessly to secure components and build products ahead of our forecasted demand. We remain committed to providing uninterrupted supply and the highest quality product to all our global customers. In closing, the fourth quarter marked a terrific end to a remarkable year of strong financial performance and operational achievements. We have so many exciting opportunities in the years ahead, and the entire Insulet team remains committed to executing our mission and strengthening our long-term growth trajectory.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Jim. 2022 was an exciting year with the U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 and the fourth quarter was no exception. We once again delivered strong financial results while advancing our mission. In Q4, we generated 23% revenue growth, fishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 36%.  On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 250 basis point headwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 45%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $15 million net volume benefit associated with the Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was driven primarily by new Omnipod 5 customers including conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we again benefited from some customers simultaneously getting both their starter kits and first order of refills as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This benefit was partially offset by some Omnipod 5 customers skipping a refill as a result of this dynamic. This volume benefit primarily from conversions will create a tougher comparison in future years as we expect most existing customers to switch to Omnipod 5 in 2023. During Q4, Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts. This is an important milestone in our transition to pharmacy as all Omnipod 5 coverage is through the pharmacy channel and is the majority -- as is the majority of Omnipod DASH. As a result, our pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 80% of our total U.S. volume in the fourth quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 19% in Q4, above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 13-point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 3 points favorable versus our guide. As a reminder, our revenue in Q4 of the prior year was impacted by an unfavorable $5 million channel inventory reduction creating an easier comparison. During Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remain consistent with prior years with higher utilization in Q4. Note, we estimated higher utilization in Q3 above historic trends with the volume benefit of the initial Omnipod 5 ramp. Historically, our U.S. utilization has been highest in the fourth quarter of the year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 90% and slightly better than our guidance range. Gross margin was 58.8%, representing an approximate 10-point decrease, including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 50 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $21 million net charge or approximately 570 basis points associated with the voluntary medical device correction. This net charge was comprised of $27 million related to our previously announced Omnipod 5 MDC, partially offset by a $6 million benefit due to a revised estimated costs associated with the Omnipod DASH MDC. Excluding the Q4 MDC net charge, adjusted gross margin was 64.5%, representing a 480 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue and a charge associated with the phaseout of classic Omnipod. Operating expenses were above our expectations to support continued higher sales performance and were higher than Q4 of last year as we further invest in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA and in Q4 were 11.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Both exclude the voluntary medical device correction net charge and a $2 million benefit related to a legal settlement adjustment. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to full year results. We delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% and total company revenue growth of 22%, which reflects the incredible demand for Omnipod 5 ongoing contribution from Omnipod DASH throughout our global markets and the benefit of our annuity-based business model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was unfavorable over the prior year by 360 basis points. In 2022, we achieved adjusted gross margin of 66.2%, down 220 basis points and in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points. and adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.2%, down 240 basis points. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses and were slightly higher than our expectations due to our revenue outperformance. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with $675 million in cash. In addition, during Q4, we further strengthened our financial position by increasing our available borrowings under our credit agreement to $100 million. We remain in a solid position to continue investing in our business. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22% and total company revenue growth of 14% to 19%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 21% to 26%, driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts, and conversions from another Omnipod product as well as the continued adoption of Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. We currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be more weighted to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We -- while we're excited to introduce Omnipod 5 to our first international markets later this year, given our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution to growth in our international markets for Omnipod 5 in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery in 2023, we expect a decline of 55% to 45%, representing a $1 decline similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. We expect a favorable impact from the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel and favorable geographical sales mix. These tailwinds are expected to be more than offset by inflation higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be near the lower end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing sales volume, improving manufacturing performance, and timing of the additional costs associated with the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 medical device corrections. We expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts including the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We expect operating margin to be in the high single digits, similar to 2022 levels with significant improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. For capital expenditures, we expect a lower level than 2022 as we begin to leverage our investments, building capacity to date. Turning to our first quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 22% to 25% and total company growth of 11% to 14%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 200 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 33% to 36%. We expect the core drivers of growth to be the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our consistent record new customer starts as well as our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 4% to 7%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds and and estimated order timing. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be nominal based on the current production schedule. In conclusion, we delivered a strong finish in the fourth quarter and another year of solid financial performance. We achieved many milestones and entered 2023 with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business. We're incredibly excited about the year ahead and what is to come for our customers and our shareholders as we further execute our global mission.  With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Well, first off, congrats on a really nice quarter, impressive work. Maybe for my question, I'll ask on new patient growth. By my math, it looks like you're somewhere in the low 30% year-over-year with a much better second half versus first half. It's great to see that competitive switches are becoming part of the equation. All age groups, 100% in pharmacy. It's you're basically taking off all the right boxes. I guess the question is, how sustainable do you think this trend is? Do you think it's a bit of early adopters or new converters? Or do you think this is the start of a longer duration, multiyear trend where Insulet can start to shift towards market leader in terms of new patients and overall market share?\nJim Hollingshead: I'll start with that, Robbie, it's Jim. Thanks for your congrats, by the way. I'll start and then either way or Brent might want to add color -- we're very bullish on Omnipod 5. There's -- obviously, we're so strong out of the gate here. And as Wayde talked about in his prepared remarks, and we talked about last quarter, there are some things going on here with starter kits, and so it's hard for us to get a quantitative trend. But in terms of the nature of demand, we think it's really strong, and we're really bullish. Omnipod 5 is going to be such a revolutionary offer -- it's such a great experience for customers is delivering such great results that we think demand will continue to persist for the long -- not just through '23, but for the long haul. But I'll invite Bret or way Bret and Wayde to comment.\nWayde McMillan: Sure, Jim. I can jump in. Robbie, it is, as Jim said, a really strong start here in our first 5 reported months with Omnipod 5 in this new platform. And so we think it's very sustainable. As Jim said, we have a significant innovation pipeline to come yet. We'll be bringing, as you know, iOS integration with G7, Libre. We just got the type 2 indication -- pardon me, the Type 2 trial finalized with the FDA, and so we'll be pursuing an indication for type 2 for Omnipod 5 as well. So we're just going to layer in a lot more innovations over time. So that gives us confidence that the platform will continue to grow. Having said that, as Jim called out in our prepared remarks, a big driver of our current growth rate is our converting customers, moving from the DME into the pharmacy channel. So that's what we called out in the prepared remarks that will create a bit of a tougher comp for us next year. So the new converters, obviously, as our current customers, classic Omnipod and DASH customers convert Omnipod 5, and we're assuming most of them will be done by the end of 2023. That's the piece that won't be as sustainable because once they convert, they're done. But the rest of the business just doing incredibly well. record new customer starts, as Jim said, from MDI from competitive switches. And so we do think we're at the front edge of a very long multiyear growth cycle.\nBret Christensen: Ravi, I'll just pile on to since you asked about new starts. MDI is probably the biggest indicator of it. So is waiting Jim Bill said record MDI, record competitive conversions, record overall new starts. The MDIs, we think, is absolutely sustainable. But also, remember, we were still optimizing things in Q4. There were some speed bumps with the onboarding process. access was not maximized, but did get to 90%, which mirrored our our new starts for the quarter. And then we are just really starting to promote Omnipod 5 in earnest, and you'll see some DTC rolling out. So from my standpoint, I think MDI growth can absolutely sustain throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Congratulations on the quarter. Just wanted to ask a question, I guess, on the international launch of Omnipod 5. Obviously, we've now got a couple of markets that we know is coming into here in the second half of this year. Jim, maybe you can just level set us again. I know there's some stricter restrictions on the warranty periods in some of these markets. You're going to have to pursue reimbursement in some of these markets. There's cloud-based data regulations, you're waiting their way through. But I'm going to tell you, I mean over here at ATTD, it was helpable yesterday, the interest in 05 to the point that I was a little worried for Dr. Li with some of the feedback from some of the doctors just on how much they were battling to get her to commit to launching 05 sooner in a lot of these countries in that. I mean there is true interest as you guys, I'm sure, well know. So how fast can new patients start MDI win competitive converts, those kind of things ramp in the international markets relative to what we've seen so strong here out of the gate in the U.S.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Jeff. We know there's a lot of pent demand for Omnipod 5 and just tons of interest. And actually, we talked to Train we knew -- we heard a little bit about the pressure she was under in the session. And obviously, we want to get Omnipod 5 into every market we can as fast as we can. It's both because it's a great growth opportunity for us, but really because it's such a benefit to customers. And -- we know just the things we see here in the U.S. feedback we're getting from customers; it's changing people's lives. It's such a great experience. It's so simple to use. So we want to move just as fast as we can, first thing. We have announced that we're going to do the U.K. in the middle of the year in Germany by the end of the year. There's a bunch of reasons for that. They're both obviously large and important markets. There are some things we can do to execute there a little more quickly we're working really hard in the background to be able to -- to continue to get into markets as quickly as we can. And we want to be able to reach all those patients. And obviously, it's in our interest to do it, but it's really -- we need to get to those patients and help them. It's really exciting. Every market, I think specific to your question, every market has a little bit of a different set of regulations around once people have been put on a pump or when can they switch and that sort of thing. I think as a general rule, with the caveat that every market is a little different. As a general rule, it won't be as easy to get on to Omnipod 5 for an existing tube pump user as it is in the U.S. because in the U.S., obviously, we have the pharmacy channel benefit. We're in a different category of reimbursement, so people can switch over to pharmacy reimbursement and get on Omnipod 5, they can use our free trial. That ability to switch has been a huge growth driver for us in the U.S. And in a lot of the European markets, it will be a little bit stickier. But those markets are still really under-penetrated. And the standard patient in all of those European markets is still an MDI. And so there are a bunch of people who are self-injecting who are waiting for the innovation to come. And it's just really exciting for us. We want to move as fast as we can. And when we get into market, as Wayde said, we have to guide a little bit. We have to be a little bit cautious about how we got on things like revenue because our model is somebody converts to Omnipod 5. And then as you know, there's an annuity ramp. So the revenue builds as people get on product and then they use pods. And so we have to be a little bit mindful of how we guide on the revenue impact, but we think there's really important underpenetrated markets across all of the markets we're in. and we're moving just as fast as we can to meet that need.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford : Congrats. Maybe just a simple question here, just looking at the volume and the revenue growth. Volume through the pharmacy, is there a ceiling to that number? Where can that go?\nBret Christensen: Jayson, I'll take that one. This is Bret. It's -- there could be, but it's not in the same way that you might see with other companies because remember, we do have a Part D indication from CMS, which means all of our Medicare business goes through the pharmacy channel. Medicaid business goes through the pharmacy channel. All Omnipod 5 business goes to the pharmacy channel. So really, there's not a ceiling, except for the fact that we do still have DME contracts with our legacy product which, of course, we announced we will phase out at the end of the year and then a little bit with DASH. But outside of that, if you just look past those products with Omnipod 5 and beyond, there really is not a ceiling to the volume that we get it in the pharmacy channel is all of Omnipod 5 will go through the pharmacy channel and all Medicare, Medicaid. So we're going to be much higher than I think most companies in diabetes don't know if we'll ever get to 100%, but don't see a ceiling that prevents us from getting there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Congratulations on a really strong quarter here. I wanted to shift gears and ask about the basal-only pod. You've submitted the 510(k). When do you expect approval, mid-'23? Is that reasonable? How quickly do you expect to commercialize it do you expect a similar kind of LMR to what we saw with Omnipod 5? And what kind of contribution are you expecting this year and next year? And just lastly -- I'm sorry for all the questions. Who is the sweet spot for this product, which patients do you think are ideal Thanks, Larry. I'll start -- I'm going to start with the back end of your question and ask Bret to comment on the front end of your questions. We think the sweet spot customer is a person with type 2 diabetes who is currently doing daily injections or it has not started daily injections.  And so because they've been putting it off because they have a needle phobia or the Cetin convenience are trying to do it or they are on daily injections, but they're missing their daily injections because they don't like doing it. I mean so what basal only does is it gets upstream in the patient progression for people with type 2 diabetes. And people with type 2 diabetes as a general rule, have a lot going on. They have a lot to manage. And so we think there's real power with that customer at that stage of transitioning into or having just casting into insulin usage where we can really radically simplify their experience, make sure they get their daily insulin with high convenience, ease of use, no felt needles. We think there's a lot of power in it. The research we've done shows that there's power in it, and we expect it to really need a need in that part of the market.  And then importantly, those customers will use Omnipod, the Omnipod platform, they'll get used to the on-body experience. Almost every person with type 2 diabetes who needs insulin, progresses in their needs for insulin and they need -- they go from they go from, say, once-daily basal to intensive insulin need, which is a basal-bolus which is Omnipod 5. And so we're moving upstream with an offer that genuinely simplifies the experience for those people. But then gets them ready to transition as their needs transition on Omnipod 5. And Bret, you might -- if you could get the other part of Larry's question, that would be great.\nBret Christensen: Yes, absolutely. So Larry, the first part of your question, around timing and clearance of course, we won't comment on that except that we have said it is with the FDA. And so we're happy with that. We won't speculate on when we'll get approval. We did say we'd start commercialization likely in 2024 we wil surely launch in a limited fashion, just as we did with Omnipod 5, we just think that's the best practice. There's a lot we want to learn. We want to scale manufacturing; we want to refine the commercial model. We've got to build access remember, with this product. So we're having conversations today with payers, and those are going well. You should expect that we'll launch in a limited fashion. We'll probably start in the call point where we exist today, which is mostly endocrinology and some of the high-riding primary care physicians. And then we'll figure out how we tackle this population as they do reside with primary care, family practice doctors, some with endocrinology as well. We're excited about the product. We think it fills a clear need -- and it's going to be really exciting, but we're refining the commercial model and the launch plans right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor : Congrats on a good result. So I wanted to ask you kind of a conceptual question investors have accessed this and I'm curious to hear your answer. Just with all of the new diabetes drugs and the loss drugs. I think in the most extreme form of this argument, people would say, \"Oh, use you're going to cure diabetes and potentially have an impact on your market and demand for pumps. So I guess, what would you say to investors who have that question about whether the whole classes of new drugs can actually impact the market? Does it curb your opportunity at all? Or do you think that it's just sort of a side show?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. I'll start with that. The first thing is we're thrilled to see innovation in the diabetes space. That's why we get out of bed every day -- we want to help people with diabetes -- we want to make sure they get the care they need. We want to simplify their lives, we want to improve their outcomes. And so to see a lot of companies innovating in this space, whether it's drug companies, device companies, data companies. We're really happy to see that kind of innovation for the same people we're trying to help. And so that's all a positive. In terms of all the -- all these new drugs, it's early days to see. I mean, there's been -- obviously, there have been a lot of noise and results in the market around it. I think it's early days to know how they will impact the progression, really, they're aimed at people with type 2 diabetes and they may or may not impact the progression of disease. I think if you look at some of the clinical studies, what you see is, in many cases, the people in the clinicals for those drugs were actually also insulin users, which is an interesting dynamic. But what I keep coming back to is there are 0.5 billion people on the planet with diabetes. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, -- everywhere the Western diet goes, type 2 diabetes follows. And so it's a massive unmet global medical need. And I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our business. There's so many people for us to help. It's a massively underpenetrated market. And as happy as we are to see people get helped with new innovations, our goal is to continue to innovate our platform, and we think there will be more than enough people for us to sustain quite a lot of growth as we help them.\nBret Christensen: And Jim said it, the value proposition of our basal-only pod is not -- is not to compete with the GLP-1s, and these great drugs that are out now like Epiduo we think that it's a complement to those. And Jim said it many of those patients in those clinical studies were on insulin. We know and we hear from physicians all the time. that patients do not get on insulin soon enough. And so that's the goal here with the basal-only pod is to remove the needle phobia, to improve adherence and to complement in many cases, these drugs that are already helping people with type 2 diabetes, and we think there's a clear spot for it. But again, we'll learn all of that in our limited release and as we launch the product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steve from Bank of America. I did want to ask about the patents. -- been 11 movements in the patents on your side lately in the last few weeks. So is that more about protecting the current portfolio? Or is it more about building a pipeline -- are you expecting the space to get more litigious over the course of the next 2 years? And then I also wanted to ask about the -- I think you heard you leverage in leverageable investments, and I know that how you thought about kind of margin kind of beyond 2023, if you can get back to the kind of normal couple of hundred basis points of margin expansion.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Travis, and thanks for your congrats. I'll start with the IP stuff and then I'll ask Wayde to comment on the margin side. It's a little bit of both. We're really bullish on our IP, and we've been working all year actually for months before that, but we've had a concerted effort this year to make sure that we are not just showing up our IP position but growing our IP position. And we've done that, as I said in the prepared comments, we've done that through a number of avenues, including organically, we filed a record number of patents this year. And then we made some settlements, we made the settlement with Medtronic to shore up our position and pay some certainty. And then the acquisition of patents. And as you know, with IP, it's both end, right? And so the more IP you have, the better position you are in terms of playing defense, but also the better position you are in terms of commercializing sort of ideating creating new offerings and commercializing them. So we think it's put us in a great position on both of those. And specific to Bigfoot Biomedical, they had a very rich very rich set of intellectual property patents and filed patents, granite patents and filed patents that we find really interesting from an innovation point of view. But it's both and in terms of offense and defense.\nWayde McMillan: Jim, I could pick up on the margin piece of the question. And so Travis, as you said, we've been committed to margin expansion. -- and we've had to hit pause here for a couple of years, and that's mainly driven by the macroeconomic pressures that many businesses have felt. And from an investment strategy standpoint, we had a choice to make, and we decided that instead of reducing our investment in commercial expansion and research and development, that we would continue to invest through this inflationary cycle -- and even though we're paying higher cost for components and it's putting pressure on our gross margins, in addition to some of the business model challenges like with Omnipod 5 at a slightly higher cost and our U.S. manufacturing facility taking some time to hit an inflection point and still a higher cost facility for us. We decided to continue to invest heavily in our leadership position, and that is just because of this large market opportunity that Jim just referenced. And we've got a really strong leadership position to build on here. and we want to make sure that we're as best positioned as possible. And then you're right, Travis, we included in our prepared remarks, that continued commitment. And we think that given the investments that we're making up till now and through 2023 will put us in a position to start to leverage gross margins and operating margins again starting in 2024. We haven't put a number on it yet or given guidance yet. We're just confident that we're in a good position with the investments we're making now, both in the U.S. and internationally and across our operations to start to leverage again in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Thanks very much. Wanted to ask about the type 2 opportunity in the U.S. or just the current business. The 15% to 20% of new patient starts -- are you seeing the DASH conversions to 05 in that segment? Or are you seeing of that 15% to 20% of the patient starts '05 accounting for Haripaccounting for a big slug of that? And how are you thinking about -- or what's making the guidance for Omnipod 5 and Type 2 before we have clinical data and on label or an on-label decision by the FDA.\nBret Christensen: Josh, I'll take the first part of that question and I can let Wayde comment on guidance. So the 15% to 20% that we referenced, -- that's a percentage of all new starts. So new starts for us are new to brand, never been on Omnipod. And those are -- so those are truly coming from either MDI or a competitive to pump, and that's the percent of all new starts that were type 2 for us. So historically, that's been as high as 40%. It's a lower percentage today, but only because the Omnipod 5 numbers are so high. And for the second half of this past year, we've been spending a lot of time in the field speaking to physicians about Omnipod 5, educating the staff, explaining the algorithm, helping patients get on board.  And so a good portion of our field time has been devoted to the launch of that new product. But the raw numbers type 2 patients new to Omnipod are really not that different. It's just the percentages are down. We think the offering is fantastic. We look forward to this year where now that physicians are comfortable with Omnipod 5 or writing prescriptions that we can start to have a portfolio sell in the field and start to talk about the type 2 offering with DASH and the value that Omnipod firing. So it's still a fantastic opportunity for us that is really, really underpenetrated and we're excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: I wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the volume benefits that you guys have had and part of it is the retail pharmacy part is a just the upgrade from older generation Omnipod. So if we take those 2 individually, you've got 80,000 retail pharmacies in the U.S. should all of them have 05 as of what you've seen to date, which ones do? And I guess, how is throughput there? And then similarly, in terms of the volume benefits of upgrades, where are we right now within that process if you guys could us kind of even a rough percentage and whether or not that should impact the '23 numbers at all or guidance?\nJim Hollingshead: Sure. Margaret, I can start with the conversion insights and the volume and then Bret, probably best positioned to talk about the expansion because those are 2 of the major drivers, which, as you know, Margaret, we called out in the prepared remarks. Just to confirm for everyone, we call conversions, our existing Omni podders, whether classic Omnipod or DASH, who convert over to Omnipod 5, which is a little different than the 2 pump market, I think, which cause them upgrades.  And to be clear, we do not call conversions or upgrades, new customers. Those are not factored into our new customer totals because for us, it's an annuity model. And so as people move from older products to new generations, we don't call them new shipments or upgrades or whatever others in the market call them. For us, it's just customers converting to the latest technology. And where we're at in that is making great progress. In fact, as Jim had in his prepared remarks, overwhelmingly success here with a lot of our existing customers wanting to move on to Omnipod 5 and frankly, put some of the stress on the system in the first couple of months. And so significant conversions. And we think, Margaret, that we'll be through most of them by the end of 2023. But just as a reminder, until we get a type 2 indication for Omnipod 5 and maybe even after DASH is still the product for type 2 customers.  And so we'll still have quite a few DASH customers on type 2 and those won't be converting over to Omnipod 5. So those are the major drivers of the volume benefit. Obviously, the single largest driver for us is new customer starts, and we've had record new customer start quarters for some time in the U.S. So that's the major driver of the volume benefit. And then also, as you mentioned, retail pharmacies, that is also a smaller component of the $5 million ramp benefit we called out here in the quarter as we start to stock retail pharmacies. Bret, do you want to pick up with that one?\nBret Christensen: Yes, Margaret. We have talked about the 85,000 or so retail pharmacies in the U.S. And we don't report out on how many of those pharmacies have distributed Omnipod, but we do get that information from IQVIA is obviously it's substantial. But the reason is -- I don't think it's that important because what's really important to me is how many pharmacies have access to 75 and can dispense Omnipod 5? And the answer to that is really almost all of them because we've done a really good job building the channel out. We've got product with all the major wholesalers and those wholesalers supply Omnipod 5 to the pharmacy. So -- as far as the 85,000 retail pharmacies as far as the are there and how much Omnipod is on the shelf, it's really not that much because when a physician sends a prescription to a pharmacy, it's about 24 hours that a wholesaler will send Omnipod to that retail pharmacy.  In most cases, that's how it's happening. In some cases, those retail pharmacies do stock Omnipod when they know they've got regular Omnipod customers picking up their product every month. But the channel is really strong. And the reality is that most of those pharmacies have the ability to distribute Omnipod.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: I was Hoping you could provide some more detail on when you think you could have G7 integration. Is that something we should expect in the second quarter -- and then the lack of an iOS app has really been sort of an afterthought in not successful the 05 launch has been, but you've been working on it for a while now. Is that something we should expect in the next quarter or in '23? Any clarity there would be great. Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Chris, for your question. I\u2019ll start. We\u2019re working really closely with our partners, both Dexcom and Abbott on CGM integration and working really hard on \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t give advanced notice of time lines that we expect or anything like that. I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re working really hard, and we see them both is extremely important \u2013 and we\u2019re very bullish on completing integrations across the ICGM space as those CGMs become available. On iOS, that work continues to go really well. Same answer. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not reporting on time lines. But that app is, I think, progressing really, really nicely. And as we have more news, we\u2019ll give it to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. This is Caitlin on for Kyle. What's the full impact of pricing in 2023, including the upgrades of everyone to DASH and '05? And can you break that out from a volume mix perspective?\nWayde McMillan: Calin, it's Wayde. That's not a metric that we break out. But as you highlight, we do benefit from the premium in the pharmacy channel. And that's largely driven by the conversions we have from the DME channel as well as new customers coming on through the pharmacy channel. I'll just remind everybody that part of the headwind that we have in gross margin is because we give the PDM for no charge. And so as we're significantly ramping up new customers here, that's one of the impacts that the Omnipod 5 product cost impacts our gross margins. But having said that, pricing is a smaller component of our revenue growth. The far larger components are volume, including the initial volume ramp here with Omnipod 5 and this 2-script benefit that we're getting at the early stages here in the first couple of quarters -- and so we don't break out that metric for you, but it's something that's been positive for us, and we think it will continue to be positive for us in the pharmacy channel.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. It will come from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just -- and this question might be for Wayde. But Wayde, when I look at the U.S., the absolute dollars in the U.S. from -- over the last couple of years here. I know there's an adjustment for the stocking that we saw in '22 about -- I think it was around $80 million. you're up from '21 to '22 about $150 million. When you net that out at $80 million out, you're $800 million up to about bilo1.1 billion in '23. So you're up almost $300 million year-over-year when you make those again, those adjustments for stocking.  So what I'm trying to figure out is, I know Q2 was a monster as far as patient ASCO or Q1 is going to be the same thing. But just what does that imply as far as new patient adds on the MDI side, and you're clearly expanding the market, what does that imply as far as market growth goes? And what does that imply in terms of competitive share conversion as well? Because it seems like there's an acceleration implied there as well to get there. And then from an infrastructure perspective, do you have everything in place, manufacturing customer service to support this almost doubling of U.S. Omnipod revenue over a couple of year period?\nWayde McMillan: I didn't leave a lot on the bone there, Matt. That's a broad question with a lot of areas to answer. I think -- and I got to be honest, I didn't follow the stocking math that you were doing there that we don't have anything that we track in the order of magnitude that you were talking about there. So let me try to get at, I think what the question is getting at, which is how are we continuing to grow the business and in particular, in the U.S. And because we don't have any hundreds of millions, normalization items that you're talking about. From time to time, we will call out increases or decreases in the channel. And so just to confirm, for 2022, -- we had nothing in Q1.  In Q2, we had $7 million channel increase as we started to roll out Omnipod 5. And then here in the third and fourth quarter, we've called out this additional script benefit, $16 million in Q3 and $15 -- so when you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact in the U.S. And so not to the orders of magnitude you were getting at, but something that we certainly want to be aware of because most of that volume benefit is being driven by converting customers. And just so everybody is aware of what this dynamic is that we keep talking about. It's -- as we launch Omnipod 5, the new customer will get a starter kit, which is their personal diabetes manager as well as their initial order of pods. And if they also get their first pharmacy script order, they will get, say, for example, 2 months in September. So September, they get their initial starter kit and they get their first order. What we're curious to see is how that would impact our second quarter of Omnipod 5. And what we did see is a good percentage of customers actually skip an order and use up those pods. And so we did see a benefit as well, again, for people getting 2 scripts in Q4. And when you net the 2 of those out, it was approximately $15 million. And so that was our estimate. If you -- again, if you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact and that's why we're calling it out. If you go to the share -- part of your question then, Matt, was, are we taking share? Absolutely. There's no question that we're growing at accelerated rates in the United States, way above market growth. And as Bret and Jim highlighted earlier in the call, we had a record number of competitive switches, which means, in the past, we used to get about 20% of our customers from competitive switches, 80% from multiple daily injection. You see in the metrics we provided here, that's now 65% MDI, 35% competitive switches. Both of those are record numbers, record number of competitive switches, record number of MDs coming new customers, new to pump therapy coming on to our products. So we do think that we'll be a share taker for some time to come. We've talked about a lot of the things on the call today that we think are continued drivers of our business that keep us in the leadership position. So I'll probably leave it there, Matt. I look forward to catching up with you after the call and see if we can clear any other parts of your question.\nOperator: And we have a question from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Company.\nSteve Lichtman : Congrats, everyone. You mentioned on DTC that you'll be putting the foot down here near term. Can you talk a little bit about what your plans are there? What form will it take? When are you planning on kicking that off? And do you see that as a particular opportunity once you get a type 2 label for Omnipod 5?\nBret Christensen: Steve, yes, it's Bret. Thanks for the question. I don't know if we're putting the foot down, but we are starting to use DTC for Omnipod 5, and you'll start to see that via TV. We've always been strong with social media, digital advertising and now we'll start TV with Omnipod 5 this quarter if you haven't seen it already. So you'll start to see a little bit of that we'll see how it goes. And then as far as the type 2 opportunity goes, we know there's an opportunity to create awareness for sure with type 2. But we'll see how that goes with the launch of Basel pod. Have done for type 2 with a focus on Medicare free trial, things like that in the past with the DASH product. So you won't see anything with pot of course, until we get a label, I won't see anything with Basel pod. -- and the focus this quarter will be DTC for Omnipod 5.\nOperator: This will conclude today's Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks.\nDeborah Gordon: Jim, sorry about that. This is Deb. Just before you close, I just want to let everybody know that call to your attention that there was an error in the earnings release, it was in the appendix in the adjusted earnings per share reconciliation. One of the EPS adjustments should have been a reduction to EPS, not in addition. And therefore, I just want to let everybody know that non-GAAP adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.49 instead of the $0.55 that's shown, and we'll be issuing an update shortly. Just note also, there is no change to adjusted EPS for the full year. It's correct as shown.  Sorry, Jim, go ahead.\nJim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. That's a real-time catch everybody. So I hope everybody stayed on the call long enough to get that update. So thanks, Deb. And thanks, Julian, for shepherding the call. And more importantly, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. These are remarkable and really exciting times at Insulet, and we are just getting started fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is clearly transforming the diabetes landscape, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance and strengthen our global competitive position. So thank you all, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q4, the global Insulet team delivered another record quarter of growth, which was a strong end cap to a remarkable 2022. We exceeded our expectations once again, achieving revenue growth of 45% in the U.S. and over 35% for total Omnipod and our U.S. and global new customer starts were at record levels. And 2022 marked our seventh consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth. This past year, we not only drove consistently strong financial performance, we also achieved a number of critical milestones. We now have roughly 360,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, including more than 100,000 customers on Omnipod 5. In fact, during Q4, Omnipod 5 represented over 90% of our U.S. new customer starts. This transformative technology is the leading offer in the market and is proving to be the obvious choice for consumers. The 2022 full market release of our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was a huge achievement. This is the product our company was founded to make. And we continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, adding CE Mark approval and quickly extending our label in the U.S. to include pediatric customers down to age 2 for Omnipod 5, as well as completing the 510(k) submission for our type 2 basal-only pod. During 2022, we also further strengthened our intellectual property mode representing a culmination of work throughout the year that should protect our innovation capabilities and opportunities for years to come. And we made notable advancements in our clinical efforts, including the recent publication of our first look at real-world evidence for Omnipod 5. I'll speak in more detail about the highlights of these accomplishments in a few minutes. I could not be more proud of everything the Insulet team has achieved in advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. And on top of everything we've achieved during 2022, I am confident our best is yet to come. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched as an AID system. With Omnipod 5, we have delivered a number of market firsts -- it's the only tubeless waterproof pod-based AID system and the first to offer full compatible smartphone control with constant cloud-based connectivity -- this means doctors don't have to wait for data to be uploaded when or if a patient visits a physician. With Omnipod 5, customers no longer need to plug in their devices to access their data. Our smart bolus calculator helps patients manage their blood glucose levels and trends, and there are no other AID systems that include the adaptive algorithm that Omnipod 5 has. It works right out of the box and learns each customer's specific usage and then predict their trends and automatically personalizes their care. These all are competitive advantages that significantly improve and simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 continues to drive customer adoption from all market segments. MDI users are growing at the high end of our forecast as are those switching from competitive tube pumps. And the number of current Omnipod customer conversions are exceeding our expectations.  In Q4, the percentage of customers coming from MDI and traditional tube pumps was an estimated 65-35 split compared to our historical 80-20 mix due to significantly more competitive switches. This again speaks to the value Omnipod 5 brings to MDI and traditional tube pump users. We also continue to win back thousands of customers who had once been potters and returned to us in Q4 to adopt Omnipod 5. Adopters are coming from all age groups. Due to higher-than-expected demand for Omnipod 5, we increased investments in our support capabilities, primarily within our call centers. These investments have helped drive our customer and product support experience back to historical levels of excellence. This has included taking quick action to address certain complaints regarding the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 handheld devices. We previously announced the medical device correction for Omnipod 5 due to an issue with the controller charging port in cable. The FDA subsequently classified this as a Class 2 correction, and we are in the process of providing replacements to our customers upon request. With respect to the previously announced Omnipod DASH MDC, we expect to complete the replacement of personal diabetes managers within the coming months. I am proud of our global team's focus to ensure these corrective actions were executed with a sense of urgency and care. Consumer-focused innovation is central to everything we do. Omnipod 5 was designed with the user 100% in mind, and the results and feedback we receive speak to our shared success. One recent story from a mother of an 8-year-old with diabetes was particularly touching. She said, \" Omnipod 5 has given me my life back. I sleep through the night. I feel like me again. Diabetes has moved from the foreground to the background in our daily lives. This speaks to the power of Omnipod 5 and supports why we designed the product and the customer experience the way we did.  A critical element to our continued strong Omnipod growth is an unwavering commitment to expand access and awareness, and we're doing this through multiple initiatives. First is through our growing presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. With low co-pays and broad coverage, access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH is affordable and simpler, which helps drive adoption and makes Omnipod more attractive and accessible, especially during challenging economic times. Second, we priced Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH, resulting in our ability to meaningfully expand commercial coverage for Omnipod 5. By year-end, coverage approached 90% of U.S. lives. Additionally, because the vast majority of our U.S. customers pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, the cost is similar to multiple daily injections, even though our technology offers improved outcomes, glycemic control and quality of life. Our annuity business model and pharmacy access also benefit physicians and payers.  We have eliminated large upfront costs and lengthy lock-in periods. This offers real value to payers compared to traditional tubed pumps sold through the durable medical equipment channel. This is especially true when you consider that on average, individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years. I also want to share that we recently notified U.S. classic Omnipod customers about our plans to phase out that technology by the end of this year since the vast majority of our customer base no longer is on our legacy product. We value every classic Omnipod customer and will help them through their transition to either Omnipod 5 or Omnipod DASH. 2022 also was another exciting year for Insulet in terms of advancing our clinical efforts, and that momentum is carrying into 2023. We recently finalized our type 2 pivotal study protocol with the FDA and received IDE approval. We plan to begin enrollment in the 3-month study in the coming weeks. This will be the largest clinical study we've conducted to date and rolling up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes from 20 sites across the U.S. There will be a targeted focus to recruit diverse and underserved populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 also opens up new avenues for clinical evidence. Yesterday, at ATTD, we shared the first release of real-world evidence for Omnipod 5 with data from more than 31,000 people using the system for at least 3 months. This kind of data is unmatched by competitors and gives us valuable insights into how people use the product and the outcomes they're achieving. We're able to see which device settings contribute to maximum time in range and minimal hypoglycemia. The data demonstrated glycemic results in line with those observed in our pivotal trials and also reinforced the benefits of our customizable target glucose settings. These are some of the reasons why Omnipod 5 will be a market leader for years to come. Our enthusiasm is shared by a health care practitioner who recently said the Omnipod 5 real-world data set is striking and that it includes all users since everyone is connected to the cloud-based system. With this large sample and limited selection bias, we see strong time in target range and minimal time below range exceeding glycemic targets on average. This is extremely promising for long-term benefit in the real world. Our real-world data for Omnipod 5 will be incredibly powerful over time since every user is cloud connected. For patients, this means we can continue to personalize and improve the overall experience. For physicians, this means we will be able to streamline their workflows. Over time, our intention is to tie that usage data to claims data to further drive Omnipod 5 adoption as well as build a host of other enhancements such as population-based health management for payers. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy. This means that we will have unprecedented insights into actual population level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and build on our already market-leading product differentiation. While we are thrilled with the market response to Omnipod 5, winning in the global diabetes market requires a commitment to innovation. Today, we have a strong innovation pipeline that includes our type 2 basal-only pod, future AID offerings and digital and data capabilities. Today, our unique form factor and access model are helping us win in the type 2 population in addition to type 1. We deliver a market-leading experience. And as a result, in Q4, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our new U.S. customer starts. We expect to build on our leading competitive position in this market as well as expand our total addressable market with the planned 2024 commercialization of our new basal-only pod. This will be a unique product for the type 2 market and will provide us with early entry into the treatment experience and help patients become comfortable with the Omnipod on-body experience. We believe this innovation will offer users a clear pathway to adopt Omnipod 5 as their insulin needs progress. We estimate the total addressable market for our basal-only pod is approximately 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We are also making great headway in our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems, and our iOS integration efforts continue to progress very well. We offer the best AID system on the market today and our future generations of technology, including CGM of choice, will continue to strengthen our leading value proposition. To continue to deliver our unique and leading technologies, a key priority for us is our intellectual property. We have significantly expanded our patent portfolio over the last few years. And in this past year, we more than doubled it both organically and through record patent filings and an acquisition. We acquired the pump and AID patent portfolio of Bigfoot Biomedical, including approximately 400 patents and a large number of global patent applications. Over many years, Big Food has developed a strong patent library covering areas such as closed loop technology, smartphone control, secure communications and improved user experience innovations. Our acquisition of these patent assets add significant strength to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a mutual agreement with Medtronic not to assert our patents at each other for certain diabetes technologies. With certain exclusions, this agreement applies to both companies' existing products as well as new products commercialized over the next 7 years and does not permit cloning each other's products. The agreement replaces an earlier one and provides more certainty around covered products and the agreement's duration. Through these efforts, we have created a broad and deep IP moat that positions us incredibly well to build upon our current leading innovative platform and continue to grow our expanding innovation pipeline. Moving on to our international operations. We had a solid year of double-digit revenue growth, even with the ongoing impact of AID competition. We expect to begin to offset those headwinds in 2023 with the launch of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. midyear and in Germany towards the end of this year, marking the beginning of our staged international rollout. We plan to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly internationally during 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities continue to support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. While macro conditions remain challenging, we continue to support our growing global customer base and the strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our operations team has worked tirelessly to secure components and build products ahead of our forecasted demand. We remain committed to providing uninterrupted supply and the highest quality product to all our global customers. In closing, the fourth quarter marked a terrific end to a remarkable year of strong financial performance and operational achievements. We have so many exciting opportunities in the years ahead, and the entire Insulet team remains committed to executing our mission and strengthening our long-term growth trajectory.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde. I'll start with that, Robbie, it's Jim. Thanks for your congrats, by the way. I'll start and then either way or Brent might want to add color -- we're very bullish on Omnipod 5. There's -- obviously, we're so strong out of the gate here. And as Wayde talked about in his prepared remarks, and we talked about last quarter, there are some things going on here with starter kits, and so it's hard for us to get a quantitative trend. But in terms of the nature of demand, we think it's really strong, and we're really bullish. Omnipod 5 is going to be such a revolutionary offer -- it's such a great experience for customers is delivering such great results that we think demand will continue to persist for the long -- not just through '23, but for the long haul. But I'll invite Bret or way Bret and Wayde to comment. Thanks, Jeff. We know there's a lot of pent demand for Omnipod 5 and just tons of interest. And actually, we talked to Train we knew -- we heard a little bit about the pressure she was under in the session. And obviously, we want to get Omnipod 5 into every market we can as fast as we can. It's both because it's a great growth opportunity for us, but really because it's such a benefit to customers. And -- we know just the things we see here in the U.S. feedback we're getting from customers; it's changing people's lives. It's such a great experience. It's so simple to use. So we want to move just as fast as we can, first thing. We have announced that we're going to do the U.K. in the middle of the year in Germany by the end of the year. There's a bunch of reasons for that. They're both obviously large and important markets. There are some things we can do to execute there a little more quickly we're working really hard in the background to be able to -- to continue to get into markets as quickly as we can. And we want to be able to reach all those patients. And obviously, it's in our interest to do it, but it's really -- we need to get to those patients and help them. It's really exciting. Every market, I think specific to your question, every market has a little bit of a different set of regulations around once people have been put on a pump or when can they switch and that sort of thing. I think as a general rule, with the caveat that every market is a little different. As a general rule, it won't be as easy to get on to Omnipod 5 for an existing tube pump user as it is in the U.S. because in the U.S., obviously, we have the pharmacy channel benefit. We're in a different category of reimbursement, so people can switch over to pharmacy reimbursement and get on Omnipod 5, they can use our free trial. That ability to switch has been a huge growth driver for us in the U.S. And in a lot of the European markets, it will be a little bit stickier. But those markets are still really under-penetrated. And the standard patient in all of those European markets is still an MDI. And so there are a bunch of people who are self-injecting who are waiting for the innovation to come. And it's just really exciting for us. We want to move as fast as we can. And when we get into market, as Wayde said, we have to guide a little bit. We have to be a little bit cautious about how we got on things like revenue because our model is somebody converts to Omnipod 5. And then as you know, there's an annuity ramp. So the revenue builds as people get on product and then they use pods. And so we have to be a little bit mindful of how we guide on the revenue impact, but we think there's really important underpenetrated markets across all of the markets we're in. and we're moving just as fast as we can to meet that need. Thanks, Matt. I'll start with that. The first thing is we're thrilled to see innovation in the diabetes space. That's why we get out of bed every day -- we want to help people with diabetes -- we want to make sure they get the care they need. We want to simplify their lives, we want to improve their outcomes. And so to see a lot of companies innovating in this space, whether it's drug companies, device companies, data companies. We're really happy to see that kind of innovation for the same people we're trying to help. And so that's all a positive. In terms of all the -- all these new drugs, it's early days to see. I mean, there's been -- obviously, there have been a lot of noise and results in the market around it. I think it's early days to know how they will impact the progression, really, they're aimed at people with type 2 diabetes and they may or may not impact the progression of disease. I think if you look at some of the clinical studies, what you see is, in many cases, the people in the clinicals for those drugs were actually also insulin users, which is an interesting dynamic. But what I keep coming back to is there are 0.5 billion people on the planet with diabetes. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, -- everywhere the Western diet goes, type 2 diabetes follows. And so it's a massive unmet global medical need. And I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our business. There's so many people for us to help. It's a massively underpenetrated market. And as happy as we are to see people get helped with new innovations, our goal is to continue to innovate our platform, and we think there will be more than enough people for us to sustain quite a lot of growth as we help them. Thanks, Travis, and thanks for your congrats. I'll start with the IP stuff and then I'll ask Wayde to comment on the margin side. It's a little bit of both. We're really bullish on our IP, and we've been working all year actually for months before that, but we've had a concerted effort this year to make sure that we are not just showing up our IP position but growing our IP position. And we've done that, as I said in the prepared comments, we've done that through a number of avenues, including organically, we filed a record number of patents this year. And then we made some settlements, we made the settlement with Medtronic to shore up our position and pay some certainty. And then the acquisition of patents. And as you know, with IP, it's both end, right? And so the more IP you have, the better position you are in terms of playing defense, but also the better position you are in terms of commercializing sort of ideating creating new offerings and commercializing them. So we think it's put us in a great position on both of those. And specific to Bigfoot Biomedical, they had a very rich very rich set of intellectual property patents and filed patents, granite patents and filed patents that we find really interesting from an innovation point of view. But it's both and in terms of offense and defense. Sure. Margaret, I can start with the conversion insights and the volume and then Bret, probably best positioned to talk about the expansion because those are 2 of the major drivers, which, as you know, Margaret, we called out in the prepared remarks. Just to confirm for everyone, we call conversions, our existing Omni podders, whether classic Omnipod or DASH, who convert over to Omnipod 5, which is a little different than the 2 pump market, I think, which cause them upgrades.  And to be clear, we do not call conversions or upgrades, new customers. Those are not factored into our new customer totals because for us, it's an annuity model. And so as people move from older products to new generations, we don't call them new shipments or upgrades or whatever others in the market call them. For us, it's just customers converting to the latest technology. And where we're at in that is making great progress. In fact, as Jim had in his prepared remarks, overwhelmingly success here with a lot of our existing customers wanting to move on to Omnipod 5 and frankly, put some of the stress on the system in the first couple of months. And so significant conversions. And we think, Margaret, that we'll be through most of them by the end of 2023. But just as a reminder, until we get a type 2 indication for Omnipod 5 and maybe even after DASH is still the product for type 2 customers.  And so we'll still have quite a few DASH customers on type 2 and those won't be converting over to Omnipod 5. So those are the major drivers of the volume benefit. Obviously, the single largest driver for us is new customer starts, and we've had record new customer start quarters for some time in the U.S. So that's the major driver of the volume benefit. And then also, as you mentioned, retail pharmacies, that is also a smaller component of the $5 million ramp benefit we called out here in the quarter as we start to stock retail pharmacies. Bret, do you want to pick up with that one? Chris, for your question. I'll start. We're working really closely with our partners, both Dexcom and Abbott on CGM integration and working really hard on \u2013 as you know, we don't give advanced notice of time lines that we expect or anything like that. I'll just say that we're working really hard, and we see them both is extremely important \u2013 and we're very bullish on completing integrations across the ICGM space as those CGMs become available. On iOS, that work continues to go really well. Same answer. We don't \u2013 we're not reporting on time lines. But that app is, I think, progressing really, really nicely. And as we have more news, we'll give it to you. Thanks, Deb. That's a real-time catch everybody. So I hope everybody stayed on the call long enough to get that update. So thanks, Deb. And thanks, Julian, for shepherding the call. And more importantly, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. These are remarkable and really exciting times at Insulet, and we are just getting started fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is clearly transforming the diabetes landscape, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance and strengthen our global competitive position. So thank you all, and have a great evening."

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. 2022 was an exciting year with the U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 and the fourth quarter was no exception. We once again delivered strong financial results while advancing our mission. In Q4, we generated 23% revenue growth, fishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 36%.  On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 250 basis point headwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 45%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $15 million net volume benefit associated with the Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was driven primarily by new Omnipod 5 customers including conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we again benefited from some customers simultaneously getting both their starter kits and first order of refills as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This benefit was partially offset by some Omnipod 5 customers skipping a refill as a result of this dynamic. This volume benefit primarily from conversions will create a tougher comparison in future years as we expect most existing customers to switch to Omnipod 5 in 2023. During Q4, Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts. This is an important milestone in our transition to pharmacy as all Omnipod 5 coverage is through the pharmacy channel and is the majority -- as is the majority of Omnipod DASH. As a result, our pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 80% of our total U.S. volume in the fourth quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 19% in Q4, above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 13-point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 3 points favorable versus our guide. As a reminder, our revenue in Q4 of the prior year was impacted by an unfavorable $5 million channel inventory reduction creating an easier comparison. During Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remain consistent with prior years with higher utilization in Q4. Note, we estimated higher utilization in Q3 above historic trends with the volume benefit of the initial Omnipod 5 ramp. Historically, our U.S. utilization has been highest in the fourth quarter of the year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 90% and slightly better than our guidance range. Gross margin was 58.8%, representing an approximate 10-point decrease, including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 50 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $21 million net charge or approximately 570 basis points associated with the voluntary medical device correction. This net charge was comprised of $27 million related to our previously announced Omnipod 5 MDC, partially offset by a $6 million benefit due to a revised estimated costs associated with the Omnipod DASH MDC. Excluding the Q4 MDC net charge, adjusted gross margin was 64.5%, representing a 480 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue and a charge associated with the phaseout of classic Omnipod. Operating expenses were above our expectations to support continued higher sales performance and were higher than Q4 of last year as we further invest in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA and in Q4 were 11.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Both exclude the voluntary medical device correction net charge and a $2 million benefit related to a legal settlement adjustment. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to full year results. We delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% and total company revenue growth of 22%, which reflects the incredible demand for Omnipod 5 ongoing contribution from Omnipod DASH throughout our global markets and the benefit of our annuity-based business model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was unfavorable over the prior year by 360 basis points. In 2022, we achieved adjusted gross margin of 66.2%, down 220 basis points and in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points. and adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.2%, down 240 basis points. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses and were slightly higher than our expectations due to our revenue outperformance. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with $675 million in cash. In addition, during Q4, we further strengthened our financial position by increasing our available borrowings under our credit agreement to $100 million. We remain in a solid position to continue investing in our business. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22% and total company revenue growth of 14% to 19%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 21% to 26%, driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts, and conversions from another Omnipod product as well as the continued adoption of Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. We currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be more weighted to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We -- while we're excited to introduce Omnipod 5 to our first international markets later this year, given our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution to growth in our international markets for Omnipod 5 in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery in 2023, we expect a decline of 55% to 45%, representing a $1 decline similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. We expect a favorable impact from the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel and favorable geographical sales mix. These tailwinds are expected to be more than offset by inflation higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be near the lower end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing sales volume, improving manufacturing performance, and timing of the additional costs associated with the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 medical device corrections. We expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts including the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We expect operating margin to be in the high single digits, similar to 2022 levels with significant improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. For capital expenditures, we expect a lower level than 2022 as we begin to leverage our investments, building capacity to date. Turning to our first quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 22% to 25% and total company growth of 11% to 14%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 200 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 33% to 36%. We expect the core drivers of growth to be the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our consistent record new customer starts as well as our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 4% to 7%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds and and estimated order timing. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be nominal based on the current production schedule. In conclusion, we delivered a strong finish in the fourth quarter and another year of solid financial performance. We achieved many milestones and entered 2023 with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business. We're incredibly excited about the year ahead and what is to come for our customers and our shareholders as we further execute our global mission.  With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Sure, Jim. I can jump in. Robbie, it is, as Jim said, a really strong start here in our first 5 reported months with Omnipod 5 in this new platform. And so we think it's very sustainable. As Jim said, we have a significant innovation pipeline to come yet. We'll be bringing, as you know, iOS integration with G7, Libre. We just got the type 2 indication -- pardon me, the Type 2 trial finalized with the FDA, and so we'll be pursuing an indication for type 2 for Omnipod 5 as well. So we're just going to layer in a lot more innovations over time. So that gives us confidence that the platform will continue to grow. Having said that, as Jim called out in our prepared remarks, a big driver of our current growth rate is our converting customers, moving from the DME into the pharmacy channel. So that's what we called out in the prepared remarks that will create a bit of a tougher comp for us next year. So the new converters, obviously, as our current customers, classic Omnipod and DASH customers convert Omnipod 5, and we're assuming most of them will be done by the end of 2023. That's the piece that won't be as sustainable because once they convert, they're done. But the rest of the business just doing incredibly well. record new customer starts, as Jim said, from MDI from competitive switches. And so we do think we're at the front edge of a very long multiyear growth cycle. Jim, I could pick up on the margin piece of the question. And so Travis, as you said, we've been committed to margin expansion. -- and we've had to hit pause here for a couple of years, and that's mainly driven by the macroeconomic pressures that many businesses have felt. And from an investment strategy standpoint, we had a choice to make, and we decided that instead of reducing our investment in commercial expansion and research and development, that we would continue to invest through this inflationary cycle -- and even though we're paying higher cost for components and it's putting pressure on our gross margins, in addition to some of the business model challenges like with Omnipod 5 at a slightly higher cost and our U.S. manufacturing facility taking some time to hit an inflection point and still a higher cost facility for us. We decided to continue to invest heavily in our leadership position, and that is just because of this large market opportunity that Jim just referenced. And we've got a really strong leadership position to build on here. and we want to make sure that we're as best positioned as possible. And then you're right, Travis, we included in our prepared remarks, that continued commitment. And we think that given the investments that we're making up till now and through 2023 will put us in a position to start to leverage gross margins and operating margins again starting in 2024. We haven't put a number on it yet or given guidance yet. We're just confident that we're in a good position with the investments we're making now, both in the U.S. and internationally and across our operations to start to leverage again in 2024. Calin, it's Wayde. That's not a metric that we break out. But as you highlight, we do benefit from the premium in the pharmacy channel. And that's largely driven by the conversions we have from the DME channel as well as new customers coming on through the pharmacy channel. I'll just remind everybody that part of the headwind that we have in gross margin is because we give the PDM for no charge. And so as we're significantly ramping up new customers here, that's one of the impacts that the Omnipod 5 product cost impacts our gross margins. But having said that, pricing is a smaller component of our revenue growth. The far larger components are volume, including the initial volume ramp here with Omnipod 5 and this 2-script benefit that we're getting at the early stages here in the first couple of quarters -- and so we don't break out that metric for you, but it's something that's been positive for us, and we think it will continue to be positive for us in the pharmacy channel. I didn't leave a lot on the bone there, Matt. That's a broad question with a lot of areas to answer. I think -- and I got to be honest, I didn't follow the stocking math that you were doing there that we don't have anything that we track in the order of magnitude that you were talking about there. So let me try to get at, I think what the question is getting at, which is how are we continuing to grow the business and in particular, in the U.S. And because we don't have any hundreds of millions, normalization items that you're talking about. From time to time, we will call out increases or decreases in the channel. And so just to confirm, for 2022, -- we had nothing in Q1.  In Q2, we had $7 million channel increase as we started to roll out Omnipod 5. And then here in the third and fourth quarter, we've called out this additional script benefit, $16 million in Q3 and $15 -- so when you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact in the U.S. And so not to the orders of magnitude you were getting at, but something that we certainly want to be aware of because most of that volume benefit is being driven by converting customers. And just so everybody is aware of what this dynamic is that we keep talking about. It's -- as we launch Omnipod 5, the new customer will get a starter kit, which is their personal diabetes manager as well as their initial order of pods. And if they also get their first pharmacy script order, they will get, say, for example, 2 months in September. So September, they get their initial starter kit and they get their first order. What we're curious to see is how that would impact our second quarter of Omnipod 5. And what we did see is a good percentage of customers actually skip an order and use up those pods. And so we did see a benefit as well, again, for people getting 2 scripts in Q4. And when you net the 2 of those out, it was approximately $15 million. And so that was our estimate. If you -- again, if you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact and that's why we're calling it out. If you go to the share -- part of your question then, Matt, was, are we taking share? Absolutely. There's no question that we're growing at accelerated rates in the United States, way above market growth. And as Bret and Jim highlighted earlier in the call, we had a record number of competitive switches, which means, in the past, we used to get about 20% of our customers from competitive switches, 80% from multiple daily injection. You see in the metrics we provided here, that's now 65% MDI, 35% competitive switches. Both of those are record numbers, record number of competitive switches, record number of MDs coming new customers, new to pump therapy coming on to our products. So we do think that we'll be a share taker for some time to come. We've talked about a lot of the things on the call today that we think are continued drivers of our business that keep us in the leadership position. So I'll probably leave it there, Matt. I look forward to catching up with you after the call and see if we can clear any other parts of your question."

            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "Ravi, I'll just pile on to since you asked about new starts. MDI is probably the biggest indicator of it. So is waiting Jim Bill said record MDI, record competitive conversions, record overall new starts. The MDIs, we think, is absolutely sustainable. But also, remember, we were still optimizing things in Q4. There were some speed bumps with the onboarding process. access was not maximized, but did get to 90%, which mirrored our our new starts for the quarter. And then we are just really starting to promote Omnipod 5 in earnest, and you'll see some DTC rolling out. So from my standpoint, I think MDI growth can absolutely sustain throughout the year. Jayson, I'll take that one. This is Bret. It's -- there could be, but it's not in the same way that you might see with other companies because remember, we do have a Part D indication from CMS, which means all of our Medicare business goes through the pharmacy channel. Medicaid business goes through the pharmacy channel. All Omnipod 5 business goes to the pharmacy channel. So really, there's not a ceiling, except for the fact that we do still have DME contracts with our legacy product which, of course, we announced we will phase out at the end of the year and then a little bit with DASH. But outside of that, if you just look past those products with Omnipod 5 and beyond, there really is not a ceiling to the volume that we get it in the pharmacy channel is all of Omnipod 5 will go through the pharmacy channel and all Medicare, Medicaid. So we're going to be much higher than I think most companies in diabetes don't know if we'll ever get to 100%, but don't see a ceiling that prevents us from getting there. Yes, absolutely. So Larry, the first part of your question, around timing and clearance of course, we won't comment on that except that we have said it is with the FDA. And so we're happy with that. We won't speculate on when we'll get approval. We did say we'd start commercialization likely in 2024 we wil surely launch in a limited fashion, just as we did with Omnipod 5, we just think that's the best practice. There's a lot we want to learn. We want to scale manufacturing; we want to refine the commercial model. We've got to build access remember, with this product. So we're having conversations today with payers, and those are going well. You should expect that we'll launch in a limited fashion. We'll probably start in the call point where we exist today, which is mostly endocrinology and some of the high-riding primary care physicians. And then we'll figure out how we tackle this population as they do reside with primary care, family practice doctors, some with endocrinology as well. We're excited about the product. We think it fills a clear need -- and it's going to be really exciting, but we're refining the commercial model and the launch plans right now. And Jim said it, the value proposition of our basal-only pod is not -- is not to compete with the GLP-1s, and these great drugs that are out now like Epiduo we think that it's a complement to those. And Jim said it many of those patients in those clinical studies were on insulin. We know and we hear from physicians all the time. that patients do not get on insulin soon enough. And so that's the goal here with the basal-only pod is to remove the needle phobia, to improve adherence and to complement in many cases, these drugs that are already helping people with type 2 diabetes, and we think there's a clear spot for it. But again, we'll learn all of that in our limited release and as we launch the product. Josh, I'll take the first part of that question and I can let Wayde comment on guidance. So the 15% to 20% that we referenced, -- that's a percentage of all new starts. So new starts for us are new to brand, never been on Omnipod. And those are -- so those are truly coming from either MDI or a competitive to pump, and that's the percent of all new starts that were type 2 for us. So historically, that's been as high as 40%. It's a lower percentage today, but only because the Omnipod 5 numbers are so high. And for the second half of this past year, we've been spending a lot of time in the field speaking to physicians about Omnipod 5, educating the staff, explaining the algorithm, helping patients get on board.  And so a good portion of our field time has been devoted to the launch of that new product. But the raw numbers type 2 patients new to Omnipod are really not that different. It's just the percentages are down. We think the offering is fantastic. We look forward to this year where now that physicians are comfortable with Omnipod 5 or writing prescriptions that we can start to have a portfolio sell in the field and start to talk about the type 2 offering with DASH and the value that Omnipod firing. So it's still a fantastic opportunity for us that is really, really underpenetrated and we're excited about. Yes, Margaret. We have talked about the 85,000 or so retail pharmacies in the U.S. And we don't report out on how many of those pharmacies have distributed Omnipod, but we do get that information from IQVIA is obviously it's substantial. But the reason is -- I don't think it's that important because what's really important to me is how many pharmacies have access to 75 and can dispense Omnipod 5? And the answer to that is really almost all of them because we've done a really good job building the channel out. We've got product with all the major wholesalers and those wholesalers supply Omnipod 5 to the pharmacy. So -- as far as the 85,000 retail pharmacies as far as the are there and how much Omnipod is on the shelf, it's really not that much because when a physician sends a prescription to a pharmacy, it's about 24 hours that a wholesaler will send Omnipod to that retail pharmacy.  In most cases, that's how it's happening. In some cases, those retail pharmacies do stock Omnipod when they know they've got regular Omnipod customers picking up their product every month. But the channel is really strong. And the reality is that most of those pharmacies have the ability to distribute Omnipod. Steve, yes, it's Bret. Thanks for the question. I don't know if we're putting the foot down, but we are starting to use DTC for Omnipod 5, and you'll start to see that via TV. We've always been strong with social media, digital advertising and now we'll start TV with Omnipod 5 this quarter if you haven't seen it already. So you'll start to see a little bit of that we'll see how it goes. And then as far as the type 2 opportunity goes, we know there's an opportunity to create awareness for sure with type 2. But we'll see how that goes with the launch of Basel pod. Have done for type 2 with a focus on Medicare free trial, things like that in the past with the DASH product. So you won't see anything with pot of course, until we get a label, I won't see anything with Basel pod. -- and the focus this quarter will be DTC for Omnipod 5."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Dilem. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 third quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking, and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong revenue performance, new customer growth and strategic progress. We increased our full year revenue outlook and the entire Insulet team continues to execute at a high level and advance our mission. We're focused on finishing the year strong and carrying sustained momentum into 2023. In Q3, we achieved several notable milestones. We once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts which helped us achieve a remarkable 42% year-over-year growth in the U.S., our highest U.S. revenue growth rate in at least a decade. This was driven in large part by an incredible start for our U.S. full market release for our revolutionary Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The feedback on Omnipod 5 from our Podders and their caregivers continues to be fantastic. And of course, we are far from finished. We continue to work to expand access to Omnipod 5 as well as increase the total addressable market for our Omnipod platform. During the quarter, we expanded Omnipod 5's indication down to H2 and secured CE Mark. We also continue to drive growth with Omnipod DASH, both in our international markets and in the U.S., especially in the type 2 diabetes market. Building on that, we are incredibly excited to announce that we have developed and will soon submit a 510(k) for a new basal-only PODD to accelerate our future growth in type 2. It's a clear indication of our commitment to further innovate for people with diabetes and expand our addressable market, and I'll share more about this in a few moments. We could not be more excited about what's yet to come for insulin and our customers. The market enthusiasm for Omnipod 5 is greater than even we anticipated. Demand is coming from all across the market. Our core target market of MDI users is growing ahead of our own forecast and continues to be the greatest source of new customers for us. But we are also seeing significant increases in customer conversions. Current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher rate than we saw with previous product launches, demonstrating that even current Podders see Omnipod 5 as a breakthrough offering. In addition to those coming from MDI, we are seeing significant volumes of customers converting from tubed pump technologies. And in many cases, we are winning back customers who had once been Podders. Thousands of people returning to us and adopting Omnipod 5. And this strong demand also comes from all age groups. We achieved record new customer starts with both adult and pediatric users. In Q3, after only two months of its full market release, Omnipod 5 represented over 80% of U.S. new customer starts compared to over 25% in Q2. This validates the power of Omnipod 5 and the competitive advantages it offers. It is the only tubeless AID system with an adaptive algorithm that works as designed right out of the box, delivering high time and range. The algorithm then learns from each patient's specific usage and automatically personalizes care over the first 2 or 3 pods. Because of that personalization, we are seeing consistent reports of increased time and range, reduction in A1c and markedly low hypoglycemia. It is the combination of clinical effectiveness and our unique Omnipod platform that is fueling our success. As a result, our historical 80-20 mix of those coming from MDI and traditional tubed pumps is changing. In Q3, we saw an estimated 60-40 split due to significantly more competitive takeaways. We're excited by our early progress and are gratified to see how Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management. We have long believed that superior innovation, offering simplicity, discretion and improved outcomes, will drive adoption in our large underpenetrated markets. Omnipod 5 is demonstrating this to be true. Omnipod 5 offers more than any other AID system on the market, including a number of market firsts. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone-controlled AID system the first system that no one has to plug in to access data and the first AID system with a predictive algorithm, our smart bolus calculator, that directly incorporates not just blood glucose levels, but also blood glucose trends. And the stories are inspiring. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who has patients on Omnipod 5, several of whom called her related about the dramatic improvements in their diabetes management. This HCP said she and her patients are amazed with our system. And for the first time, they have been in range 100% of the time. They called their experience \"life-changing\". It's clear Omnipod 5 is making it easier for our customers and their caregivers to manage diabetes, and it's simplifying the interaction between patients and their HCPs. We expect Omnipod 5's contribution to further accelerate growth as we gain additional market traction and increased commercial coverage. To that end, we've made significant strides with access. And by the end of Q3, we secured coverage for over 80% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod 5, well ahead of our initial expectations. We have also experienced a few challenges that we are hitting head on. The incredible market response has placed pressure on our onboarding capabilities, particularly incoming call volumes. Additionally, the voluntary medical device correction we initiated last month for our Omnipod DASH personal diabetes managers in response to the battery issue we identified also slightly elevated call volumes. Given this, we are in the process of carefully reviewing the early field data on the Omnipod 5 controller to ensure it meets our high expectations for safety and user satisfaction. We have received a few inbound calls highlighting a potential issue related to charging the controller. Our work is ongoing and if we ultimately decide to take a particular action, you can expect it to be swift and transparent. Every single aspect of the Omnipod 5 experience is important to us. We are investing to increase our onboarding and call center resources, and are already seeing significantly improved response times. We're driving customer growth through our access and awareness efforts. We have a differentiated business model and a unique leadership position in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Both make access to our technology extremely simple, efficient and affordable, which further differentiates Omnipod during challenging economic times. We have long focused on improving functional access for our customers. As a result, the vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel for both Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5, and the average co-pay is less than $50. Consistent with our commitment to drive expanded access, we are proud to offer our technology at a similar cost to multiple daily injections, while also delivering improved outcomes and quality of life. We also remain focused on the benefits our model provides to physicians and payers. Our pay-as-you-go model makes access easier and more affordable for customers while also eliminating lengthy lock-in periods. At the same time, it provides a superior value proposition and is less expensive for payers. We eliminate the large upfront costs that are common in the durable medical equipment channel with traditional tube pumps, which make those offerings far more expensive, especially since individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years on average. In addition to growing our strong position in the type 1 market, our initiatives are also key drivers of our leadership in the type two space. People with type 2 diabetes are becoming increasingly comfortable with an on-body tubeless device, and we offer an unmatched user experience with Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod. We were pleased with the recent local coverage determination proposal that would provide CGM coverage for basal insulin patients. This proposal, if approved, increases access to CGMs. At the same time, CGM awareness is rising, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this market expansion opportunity. Today, we're a leader in the type 2 space, and now we are taking this a step further with another novel innovation. We have developed a version of Omnipod specifically designed to treat type 2 patients on basal-only therapy, which we plan to submit to the FDA in a few days. It should greatly improve both the user experience and adherence by completely removing the use of needles. It is the perfect product for people with needle phobia and others who may struggle with adherence to daily or weekly injections. The total addressable market for our basal-only pod is estimated to be approximately three million people in the U.S. alone. It leverages our unique Omnipod platform, including auto insertion, comfortable wear and affordable access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, creating a winning first-of-its-kind product for this population. The basal-only pod is incredibly simple to use and requires no controller or phone application to deliver a fixed rate of rapid-acting insulin for 72 continuous hours. This new innovation allows early entry into the type 2 treatment pathway, gets patients comfortable with Pod Therapy and creates a clear pathway for them to adopt other Omnipod product offerings as their insulin needs evolve. Pending regulatory clearance, we plan to begin U.S. commercialization in 2024. Our basal-only pod is expected to drive TAM expansion and revenue growth for years to come while further improving the lives of people with diabetes. This innovation builds upon our leadership position in the type 2 market. During the third quarter, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts. As expected, this percentage is declining given our success driving Omnipod 5 adoption in the type 1 market. However, we remain confident that the simplicity of our Omnipod 5 platform represents a significant competitive advantage that will allow us to expand our customer base in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. As a reminder, like all AID systems, Omnipod 5 is currently indicated for use only for people with type 1 diabetes. However, the number of individuals with type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH remains very strong. Serving the type 2 population is a priority for us, and we are confident the combination of our form factor, access model and innovative product portfolio will continue to drive customer adoption. Another area of focus is advancing our clinical efforts. Our Omnipod 5 randomized controlled trial is progressing well. We're on track to complete enrollment of 120 participants in the U.S. and expect to soon begin enrollment of up to 80 participants in France. We believe the results will demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefits compared to non-AID pump use with CGM. We are confident this will strengthen our position to secure broad reimbursement and pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. As I mentioned, we were excited to receive our expanded indication down to age two for Omnipod 5. We are a leader in the pediatric segment and are confident Omnipod 5 will truly change the lives of these young children and their families. Based on our positive Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study results, I'm happy to share that we expect to begin a type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 in 2023. We continue to advance our robust innovation pipeline with a focus on future AID offerings as well as building our digital and data capabilities. Our iOS integration work is ongoing as is our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's CGMs. We remain committed to building on our product offering and also providing CGM of choice to our customers. Our investments in R&D and innovation are a strategic priority that we fully expect will drive sustainable long-term growth and continued value creation. Our priorities in this area are clear: complete integration with our CGM partners, grow our global addressable markets and create digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. One especially important feature Omnipod 5 offers is real-time usage data feeds. This simplifies diabetes management for patients and their physicians. Looking ahead, we will be in a strong position to use that data to further enhance the patient experience, improve workflows for physicians and build on our competitive advantages. Moving to our international operations. We were pleased to receive CE Mark for Omnipod 5 in September. This represents a major step in our path to deliver Omnipod 5 to people globally. We remain focused on building the necessary cloud-based infrastructure needed to deliver the Omnipod 5 experience while ensuring compliance with local data protection regulations. At the same time, we're developing country-specific launch plans and continuing our work to drive premium reimbursement. We expect to enter our first international market in mid-2023. Given our planned stage approach, we will roll out Omnipod 5 more broadly throughout 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. Global supply chain and macro-related headwinds remain, but we are addressing the needs of our expanding global customer base and supporting the adoption ramp of Omnipod 5. Our team has secured components and built product ahead of our forecasted capacity needs. While this results in increased cost that impact margins, they are necessary to deliver uninterrupted products for our customers. Although our U.S. manufacturing will continue to be a headwind to gross margin given the higher production costs, over the long term, we are confident all of our sites combined will continue to deliver the highest quality product and gross margin expansion. Our U.S. manufacturing has allowed us to build redundancy, capabilities and gain key learnings that are driving efficiency, quality and productivity improvements across all our facilities. In closing, we once again achieved notable financial, commercial and operational milestones and are focused on finishing year strong. With our customers at the center of everything we do, our entire Insulet team is executing our global mission and strengthening our foundation for sustainable long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Jim. Q3 marked another record-breaking quarter. Our global team continues to execute at a high level. And Omnipod 5 is proving to be a life-changing new option for people with diabetes. We're focused on finishing the year strong and entering 2023 with momentum. We generated 29% revenue growth in the third quarter finishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 30%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 480 basis point headwind compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 42%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. This includes a growing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the pod given we provide the PDM at no charge in the pharmacy channel. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $16 million benefit associated with the initial quarter of Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was primarily driven by conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we benefited from some customers getting both their starter kits and first refills in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were over 95% of our total U.S. new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod 5 at over 80% and an Omnipod DASH at almost 15%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to almost 75% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9%, within our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by ongoing AID competition. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,440 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 140 basis points unfavorable versus our prior guide. During Q3, our estimated global attrition remained consistent and utilization was higher, driven by the Omnipod 5 ramp benefit mentioned. Drug Delivery revenue declined 4% and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 55.3%, representing an approximate 1,300 basis point decrease including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $37 million charge or approximately 1,100 basis points related to the voluntary medical device correction. The aggregate $37 million charge in Q3 primarily reflects the estimated replacement units, shipping and reclaim costs of the PDMs for global Omnipod DASH users. This charge is within the estimated $35 million to $45 million we included in our October 8-K filing. We no longer expect any material additional operating expenses to be recorded in Q4 of this year or in 2023, as we previously had estimated. Excluding the Q3 medical device correction charge, adjusted gross margin was 66.1%, representing a 240 basis point decrease. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations, higher manufacturing costs associated with Drug Delivery and higher mix of costs given Omnipod 5 ramping. These costs were partially offset by growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium. Operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectations to support higher demand for Omnipod 5 and were higher than Q3 of last year due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, development work to advance our innovation pipeline and costs to scale our business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which exclude the voluntary medical device correction, were 11.6% and 18.4%, respectively. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $720 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising our total company full year revenue growth to a range of 18% to 19%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 24%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 30% to 31%. We expect revenue growth to be driven primarily by strong Omnipod 5 new customer starts and conversions to Omnipod 5 from both Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod as well as increasing Omnipod DASH volume and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance and now expect a range of 11% to 12%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,200 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance range and now expect a decline of 37% to 35%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%. On a year-over-year basis, we expect our gross margin will be impacted by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to ramping Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenue. These headwinds will be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results for the next couple of years. And as a result, we expect 2023 gross margin to be similar to this year. Excluding certain legal and CEO transition costs, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year due to the investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5 as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits. And for 2023, given the expectation for gross margin and the continued investments to launch Omnipod 5 in the U.S. and international markets as well as ongoing innovation, clinical, commercial and support functions to scale the business and costs associated with our implementing a new enterprise reporting system, we expect operating margins to be similar to 2022. Our commitment to margin expansion continues, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. Lastly, we now expect capital expenditures to be relatively level with prior year versus our previous expectation of a slight increase. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 11% to 14%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 26%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 500 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 15% to 18%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be nominal as the majority of our orders for the year have already been fulfilled. In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. These are exciting times, given the full market release of Omnipod 5, the recent milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made advancing our innovation pipeline. We're focused on continuing to execute at a high level and delivering on our mission. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeff Johnson: All right. Great, Jim. Yes, congratulations on the quarter. I guess a lot of big numbers and a lot of good numbers that we could focus on. But let me ask a question that maybe it doesn't focus on those things, and that's the charging issue you brought up maybe on Omnipod 5 that you might be seeing some early signs on. Obviously, I would think technologically, you can fix that, you can figure that out and maybe it doesn't even grow up to be any kind of real issue. But is there any risk at all, especially that your stock is going to be up tomorrow, expectations are high, given how good 05 seems to be going here. Any expectations we should have or concerns we should have that maybe 05 -- new Rxs have to pause for a little bit because of this charging issue, you have to come back and say, \"Hey, maybe 3 months from now, we'll have a fix or 2 months from now and then we can start up this 05 momentum again. Just help us understand kind of the level of risk in this charging issue.\nJim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. It's really early days. So let me start first and foremost with for us, patient safety is absolutely the top priority, right? And in terms of the complaints we're seeing on the charging of the Omnipod 5, it's a small number of complaints. At this point, we're looking at like a couple of dozen complaints, but we're looking at it really closely. And we don't yet have enough data to be able to understand exactly what's going on and what the risk levels are. And so we're looking at it. We're going to fully investigate it. And if we have to take any kind of action we're going to be -- as I said in the prepared comments, we're going to be really fast. We're going to be completely transparent with our customers, completely transparent with investors and obviously with the FDA, right? So I think it's too early to say, and we're looking at it really closely.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities.\nTravis Steed: Congrats on a really great quarter. I guess just to focus on -- a lot of things to ask, but to focus on the dynamic if you're talking about more to pump patients coming your way, I think you even said the word thousands. We'll have a little more color there. Do you think this is like a onetime bolus where you think people are just waiting for Omnipod 5? Or do you think this is a more sustainable trend where the 60-40 can hold? And then how that carries over to 2023. I think the Street's modeling 20% growth. I would think the U.S. could do a little better than that and OUS may be below that?\nJim Hollingshead: Travis, I'll start on that, and then I'll ask the team to maybe add some color. I'll just say that Omnipod 5 is such an appealing offer. And I think the general market has been waiting for Omnipod 5. It's revolutionary. You guys all know the value prop, but wearable disposable tubeless patch pump, we competed on that form factor for a long time very successfully. Now we've added automated insulin delivery. So patients no longer have to make the choice between a patch pump and an AID pump. And that -- and you couple that with all of the access to the channel, the reimbursement access and the economics. I don't think that value prop is going to be any less appealing in Q4 or in 2023 than it is today. But I'll ask the team if they want to add color.\nBret Christensen: Travis, it's Bret. So as you know, for years, we've talked about this 80-20 split where 80% of all of our new starts come from MDI. That has been our focus. It will continue to be a focus. But as Jim said, we don't have to -- or patients don't have to make that choice now between the superior form factor of Omnipod and an AID system, so they can get it all. And so it's not surprising to us the split changed from 80/20. We'll see where it settles in. We don't know yet if that -- if there's a bolus of to pump users that wanted to try Omnipod or if it's going to settle in there, it's likely to settle in somewhere different than 80-20, but we're excited to finally be offering a choice to those that chose an AID system, but really preferred the form factor of Omnipod. So we'll see where it settles in, in the coming quarters. But again, it's really an exciting development that we're getting these two pump conversions.\nWayde McMillan: That's great. If I could just pick up on the question around 2023 revenue growth. And it is really, as Jim, Bret said, AID is the difference maker and that shows up in the different growth rates between the regions. For U.S., we've got a lot of momentum. Obviously, as Jim and Bret just said, and we had in the prepared remarks, we're seeing increased demand with MDI as well as conversions from our existing customers, legacy product and then the competitive switches here. So a lot of momentum in the U.S. I think the way to think about 2023 -- we'll just give some color here. We're not going to provide guidance. We'll do that in our Q4 call in February. But some color to think about at this point is U.S. carrying a lot of momentum. We should see larger dollar growth in 2023. Need to normalize that for a couple of the volume benefits we've seen here in Q2 and Q3. And that should settle us out to start right now in that low 20% growth range for the U.S. And then as you said, OUS without AID, we're thinking about really consistent. We think we'll continue to grow really well with DASH in the markets that we're in. We are bringing Omnipod 5 midyear or to start to bring it to our international markets. That rollout will continue through 2024. But where that puts us for international is high single digits, low double digits range. I think it would be a good place to start for now. And of course, both those regions we'll be monitoring here throughout Q4 and getting more confidence in some of these really dynamic metrics, as Bret just highlighted. So we get a lot of things changing pretty dynamically with Omnipod 5. So we'll monitor those see where they shake out and put our guidance in place for 2023. And then Drug Delivery, just to hit that as well. At this point, we would expect drug delivery to do about the same decline next year as it did this year. So that will put us in kind of that mid-$20 million range, about a $25 million to $30 million reduction year-over-year. That's what we're experiencing this year, and we would think about the same next year. So that sets us up for some color on 2023. But as I said, we'll provide the official guide when we get to February next year.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Yes. And congrats on a great quarter. And Wayde, thanks for the very nonspecific guide for next year. I think that will help get models in a good place. As we think about some of your competitors, they talked about lots of macro headwinds and upfront cost to the patient, and you clearly have a very different business model. But I was hoping you could just give us the latest on what you think the actual out-of-pocket is on average for patients for Omnipod in the U.S. versus MDI and basal? I don't know if it's a different price point yet and what you've disclosed there or willing to disclose. And the average monthly cost for a basal patient. And is it materially different outside the U.S. just as we think about some of the macro headwinds and headwinds some of your competitors are facing?\nBret Christensen: Robbie, I can take that one. This is Bret. So as far as the macro trends in the field, we're not feeling it. We're in the midst of an Omnipod 5 launch, demand is incredibly high. The team is excited and patients are wanting to started out 2.5. I can't say that we're feeling any of the effects of a lingering COVID or any sort of macro inflationary recession-type concerns. But as you mentioned, our business model is different. And we've spent years planning a scalable, affordable business model that would allow for patients to upgrade from existing Omnipod products and start. And so we've got very low co-pays that remained below $50 on average, with the vast majority of all co-pays in the pharmacy channel being less than $5. We've said that with DASH and really the Omnipod 5 co-pays almost mirror DASH exactly where we price Omnipod 5 at parity. You've got added to the contracts with payers and pricing is very similar as far as out-of-pocket goes for our users. As far as basal-only pod, I don't know if that's the question you're asking about out-of-pocket and co-pays. We're not there yet. We'll be building reimbursement and having discussions with payers now that we've mentioned this basal-only pod. But we do have some basal usage with our existing products, primarily DASH is type 2 axis. It's very good for DASH, and they'll take DASH, they'll customize it and use it as a basal-only pump. And that reimbursement is the exact same for type 1s and type 2s for basal and for insulin intensive. So more to come on the commercialization plans of our basal-only pod, but we'll be building reimbursement next year with that product.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: I wanted to follow up, I guess, in more detail even on that basal specific pump. What are the features that we're going to look for there? Is this a mechanical pump? Is this a smart pump? Is it going to have the closed-loop features? Is this going to be maybe in the pivotal Type 2 trial or not? Or is it going to be a separate trial together?\nBret Christensen: Margaret, it's Bret. So we're excited to start to share more about the basal-only pod. Jim mentioned at the beginning of the call some of what we're excited about. And that is although we've got access today and some basal-only users will use a product like DASH, it was not built for basal-only usage. And there's a lot of complexity in pumps, and we want to take that complexity away for anybody that wants to start on a basal-only pod. So as Jim mentioned, it won't have a controller. That's very key because a lot of the complexity with pumps is around settings. There are no settings with a basal-only pod. So it's going to be designed and for the basal-only user, whether that's in endocrinology, primary care, it's focused on simplicity. And so we'll start to share more about what its form factor looks like. As Jim mentioned, we'll be submitting this product to the FDA in the coming days. And we're just excited to start educating you on what it's all about, and we'll do that in the future. But do want to highlight how excited we are to capture patients at the moment they need insulin, the moment they need an injection so they can avoid ejections altogether throughout their life on Omnipod-like products as they progress in their type 2 diabetes.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. In fact, I'll just tag on to Bret's comments. That's a key thing for us in terms of growing the TAM. We obviously -- we have the leading offer right now for patients with type 2 diabetes with Omnipod DASH, as Bret just referred to. But with the basal-only pod, we'll be getting much earlier and much further upstream into the journey of patients. And because it will be the same core Omnipod platform as a product, patients will get used to using our Omnipod product. And then as their insulin needs change, it creates the pathway for them on to our other offerings. So it's a great experience for patients. We're going to dramatically simplify the use of basal insulin for those type 2 patients. And then those customers as they progress in their therapy will have a natural pathway and/or other offerings.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: I'll echo my congratulations on a really strong quarter here. Wayde, I wanted to focus on the U.S., the $60 million, I think, in onetime items in Q3, do you expect more in. And I'm trying to reconcile, if I back that out, we, I get to about 33% growth in Q3, ex onetime items, why are you guiding to 27% to 30%, for Q4 a little bit slower. And how do we put that into the context of the 2023 color you gave, if I heard you correctly, low 20% range for U.S. Omnipod growth next year, given the Q4 guidance that you've given?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. You bet, Larry. So just starting with this volume that we got -- additional volume we got around Omnipod 5. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is some of it is timing because we only had Omnipod 5 in full market release for 2 months out of the quarter. And when people -- when some people start on Omnipod 5, as it turns out a good percentage of them ended up getting their starter kits as well as their first refill order in the quarter. So that gave us some additional volume. And then we also had some retail pharmacy stocking that is going to happen over time as more and more retail channels start to stock the product. So those are the 2 drivers of additional volume in the quarter. Your question on whether we think that will continue in Q4. We're going to monitor it very closely. We've got a lot of scenarios here of how this could play out. What we're anticipating in the guide, and that could push us either to the high end or the low end is how many of these people either wait a month to get their next script. Some people may order in the middle of the month or some people may immediately just get their next script. And so we're going to have to watch some of these dynamics and see if this volume can continue into Q4. And so just a lot to monitor, a lot of changing dynamics with Omnipod 5. We're very happy to get the volume here. At the end of the day, we are a volume business in the pharmacy channel. We're doing a lot to drive volume, both increasing access as well as all the things we're doing around innovation and awareness as well as the clinical work we're doing. You saw us announce this quarter down to H2, doing a lot of things to drive volumes here. And so we're really excited at the front end to be in the first -- just the first 2 months, and we're going to monitor this. We do think we'll get the benefit in Q4 as well. But should be somewhat offset by those people in Q3 that either take a little bit longer or take a whole month to place their next order. And then, Larry, you talked a little bit more about the Q4 guide. If you normalize for these volume benefits, then you're right, we are in about low 30s growth rate here on a normalized basis for Q2. And then as you look forward to Q4, we certainly have a much tougher comp. We had a significantly very strong quarter in Q4 last year. So we have to keep that in mind. And then, of course, we're at the front end of Omnipod 5. And so we don't want to get out in front of that. We're going to continue to monitor it, but we're really excited to see what can happen in Q4. And then as I mentioned, the key for 2023 is law of large numbers. We're planning for growing the dollar growth of the business in 2023, and that settles us out in that low 20s. And I think that's a good place to start. Again, we're not guiding. We're just trying to give some color, and we'll give our official guidance in February next year, which will give us another whole quarter here in Q4 and the start of Q1 to really understand some of these changing dynamics.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Caitlyn Cronin from Canaccord Genuity.\nCaitlyn Cronin: This is actually Kyle on here. The one question I wanted to talk about was specifically moving into more of a type 2 focus. I mean, obviously, you have a business now. We've seen some of your other diabetes technology partners when they've gone more meaningfully into the basal market, they made some commercial changes or a commercial shift in focus, adding salespeople, things of that sort. Just Bret, I wondered how we should think about the state of the sales force now with respect to the type 2 market and maybe the investments you'll need to make over the course of the next 12 to 24 months when you bring the basal-only and then eventually an AID for type 2?\nBret Christensen: Kyle, thanks for the question. So we've got a really strong type 2 offering today, as you know, with access that mirrors type 1 in the pharmacy channel. So start there. Got a really good product with DASH. It's got an indication for all insulin requiring patients, great coverage. We're going to add to that offering with getting an indication for Omnipod 5 as we've started that trial, that clinical. And we're going to add the basal-only pod in 2024. And we think what that does for us is it does allow us to capture patients at the moment they need insulin. It's too early to say what the commercial model will look like for that product. But we know we can capture some of it today with just the existing sales force and team that we have as many of those patients do reside in endocrinology and we do call on a small number of primary care physicians with the existing sales teams. So more to come there. I think it does just depend on how quickly we can build reimbursement, how quickly that launch goes and then how we start to think about primary care and capturing patients where they reside. But we'll talk more about that probably later in 2023. There's a lot to consider there. It's really exciting. It more than doubles our TAM, with more than 3 million patients in the U.S. that are basal-only. So we're excited about it, and there's a lot to consider as far as how we commercialize it in 2024.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Just 2 questions that require quick answers. On the '23 guidance, just kidding, Wayde. I know it's not guidance, but just what's the expected FX impact on revenue? And then second, on the basal-only pod, you mentioned submitting in the next few days, but I think your commercialization not until '24. So one, I just want to know, is it a 510(k)? And second, why the big gap between selling and commercialization?\nWayde McMillan: Eric, you bet. Happy to talk about the '23 color that we're providing to help everyone here before we get the guidance, Jayson, that's on a constant currency basis. And so obviously, not going to be factoring in where we think FX is going to go at this point. So just think about the color there on a constant currency basis and then I don't know if you want to talk to Basel, to\nJim Hollingshead: So on Basel, yes, it is a 510(k). we were submitting it imminently. Just a couple o. We don't want to get out in front of time lines on approvals. So we don't want -- don't want do that publicly. We'll let you guys know as we get approval and what we're going to do. And then as Bret was saying, there's work to be done on the commercialization plan. And I think the reason for that is it's a new-to-world offer. It's not a new pod. It's an Omnipod platform built on our core offering. But the patient set is new, the channel might be new. The call points might include new call points. There's just a lot to consider in the commercial offering that we need to work through. And so we don't want to jump the gun on talking about these things until we have more certainty.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, can you give any more color on timing of iOS? And two, relative to basal-only, I apologize if you mentioned this, but do you anticipate that being a lower COGS device given maybe a different price point as you go into that channel?\nJim Hollingshead: So we'll start with IOS, the iOS, that work is proceeding, as we said last quarter, we're really confident in what we're building there. Our teams have tested it. We've had it out of testing on sample customers. And we'll give you more update as we get closer. That's another one I don't want to jump the gun on and it's our practice to not talk about those dates until they're right in our hands. And so but we're very confident that our iOS offering is going to be very strong, And we want to get it to market as quickly as we can. On the basal pod, I'll just say that -- maybe you can -- maybe the guys can remind me of the question\nWayde McMillan: Sure. On the pricing and pricing, which we're not.\nJim Hollingshead: We're not ready to talk about pricing. I will say about the basal pod is that because it's based on our core Omnipod platform, it has all the same IP wrapped into it all the same IP protection. What's different about it is that it's basal-only. And so it doesn't take a controller. It has a basal rate built into it. It makes it really simple for -- just to give you some color to what we're picturing here. It's because it's the Omnipod with the auto insertion, it's really easy to put on anybody has a needle phobia. Look, I'm needle phobic, right? And I warn the Omnipod, I can't fill go in. And that's what we're going for here. Is anybody that is on basal-only therapy and has to do daily or with the injections who has needle phobia doesn't really want to do that. And the beauty of this basal-only pod is it's going to make that insertion really easy and then allow the customer to get their basal rate on a continuous basis over 72 hours. It's very disruptive -- and it's -- we think it's going to be an extremely simple experience and really change and potentially lift should have a huge benefit to their care and a huge potential benefit to payers. But there's a lot to be worked through. So we're not going to talk about pricing. We're not going to talk about COGS and those things. We'll give you guys more detail as we get closer.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research.\nChris Pasquale: Couple of more questions about the basal pod. It sounds like a very exciting opportunity. First, what percentage of basal patients have reimbursement coverage for Omnipod today? Are you going to be able to piggyback on that or you have to start from scratch with the new product? And then second, there's obviously a lot of focus on CGM adoption in this population. Is there any potential benefit to having the Pod and the CGM sensor talk to each other in this population, these patients need to titrate insulin rates as their disease progresses or anything like that? Because it sounds like what you're talking about here is more the B featured offering.\nBret Christensen: Yes. Chris, great question. The reimbursement today for basal-only patients, the answer to that is there really is no difference between insulin-intensive type 2 patients and basal patients as far as reimbursement goes. However, Omnipod was not built with basal only in mind. And so while there are some patients using it for basal only, just wasn't really built that way. And again, there's complexity with PDMs, there's complexities with settings. And so if you're going to use a product like DASH today, although it's reimbursed, you effectively have to kind of program DASH to say, look, we're going to get rid of all the mealtime features, a lot of the features and just use it as a basal-only product. So not ideal for basal-only wasn't built that way. It does seem complex some to like a primary care physician, that simply wants to write a prescription, which is what they would do with basal-only pod. And so while the reimbursement is there, we plan on changing it because it will be a different code. And so it will be a different reimbursed rate at a different price. We just haven't -- we're just not ready to talk about that. We've got work to do before we get confident in talking about what that will be, what we'll contract for. As far as the CGM goes, that's a lift for us because, as you know, CGMs provide the user with tremendous information that requires them to act. It shows physicians' time and range. And that's going to be really valuable for driving demand for a product like basal-only pod, but our initial thinking is we really don't want those 2 products to speak to each other because it does add complexity as you mentioned. And so the thought on basal-only pod to keep it as simple as possible as featured as possible. We want a position to write a prescription and that really is it. And so that means no communication with no reports, no settings. That's what we're thinking about today. And we think that's the best way to go broad and capture that marketplace.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. I show our next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: In your comments, you mentioned that current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher than previous launches. I'm just curious what portion of that installed base has converted at this point? And what portion you think could eventually convert over time? And congrats on the great quarter.\nWayde McMillan: Marie, it's Wayde. I can start that one, and then I'm sure Bret or Jim might want to jump in. So given that we're just in the first couple of months of our full market release, we are just getting started here. So we have seen -- just like in all the channels, we mentioned the competitive switches as well as MDI conversions of existing Omnipodders has also been incredibly strong even just in the first few months and tracking them through their journey coming to Omnipod 5. So the way we're thinking about this right now is if we continue to see accelerated rates of conversion -- converting customers, it will probably last throughout 2023. And the majority of them should be through in 2023. But again, in the first couple of months here, we're going to be watching this as we are with many of these different dynamics to these really strong converting trends continue after the first couple of months or do they ebb and flow over the next few years. But if we continue with these trends, we should have most customers converted by the end of 2023.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. Great. So I would love to kind of follow up a little bit on, I think what Marie was talking about as well, but more on the competitive pump side of things because that was really new information and the shift so quickly is kind of startling. So is it a function of the more legacy provider in the space that you're really being successful? Is it both of the big players there? And then can you talk about how that momentum has built or built throughout the quarter? And your thoughts on continuing to drive into a competitive pump share over the next several quarters and years. .\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. Look, I think as we said earlier in the call, customers no longer need to choose. So a number of customers have forever been drawn to the great simplicity and elegance and ease of use of the pod form factor. And with Omnipod 5, we're offering a fantastic AID algorithm. And so to get AID therapy and the preferred form factor, to get into the channel they want, to get it with the economics they want. And so it's actually not surprising to us to see a number of people switch from tubed pump offerings. The offering is just so easy to use and it delivers great clinical outcomes, incredible ease of use and great economics. And so we've had -- we were pleased to see the rate of switching in the quarter. In terms of forward look, I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. But as I said earlier, I don't think that this -- the Omnipod 5 offering will become any less appealing either to customers coming from MDI or to customers who might be using the tooth pump who went there because they wanted an AID offer. So we're very confident in the robustness of the offer.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: I guess there's been a lot of questions on the U.S., which is looking great. I wanted to ask an international one. You mentioned a few catalysts there, obviously, the CE Mark, but some evidence development that's going on there as well to expand coverage. I was just hoping you could kind of frame how you expect those kind of things to help your international growth next year and going forward?\nJim Hollingshead: So on international, there's a number of things going on. We're very pleased to get the CE Mark. So that's no longer a hurdle we have to get over. We have CE Mark, and that's good to go for Omnipod 5. As we've said before, what we're working on now in terms of Omnipod 5 launch is making sure that we have the right cloud infrastructure that delivers the right. If you think about the Omnipod 5 offering, it's a very holistic offering for customers. So we want to make sure that we're delivering the full Omnipod 5 experience in the markets where we launch. And we also obviously have to be comporting both with European and with any local market data privacy and security regulations. And so that's work that's being built. We don't need the RCT that we talk about to do that. So we'll be -- if I could just go back for a second to Omnipod 5 ex U.S., as we've said, we'll be launching in Europe in the middle of '23 and then we'll stage those launches to make sure that we have the right launch plan for each market as we cascade the second half of '23 into '24 and launch those markets. The randomized controlled trial is designed to make sure that we have the right kind of clinical evidence to position Omnipod 5 appropriately in ex U.S. markets. And so we're confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate benefit of our AID algorithm and the pod form factor against non-AID pumps and CGM alone. And that's where we're building evidence, which is a huge effort for us or a huge -- it's a huge emphasis for us to continue to build evidence for Omnipod 5.\nOperator: And I show our last question in the queue comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: And congrats on a really strong quarter. Just maybe a couple of comments -- questions around color on sort of tubeless and [indiscernible]. If you could maybe elaborate on your expectations for what percentage of people with diabetes in the U.S. historically had been selecting tubeless pump -- your pump essentially in the past? And if you think that's changing and why? And then maybe just some color as to if the mix of your patient is changing in terms of age or folks coming in as staying or returning after leaving that kind of color would be super helpful. And congrats again.\nBret Christensen: Matt, thanks for the question. So as we sort of highlighted, we are the leader in driving penetration from MDI, and that has always been our focus. So the bulk of our new starts. And for us, a new start is the first time you start on an Omnipod product. We don't count renewals. We don't count other shipments. If you start on Omnipod, new start once in your lifetime. And our focus has always been MDI, and that's where the 80-20 number has come from, where 80% of those new starts have come from MDI. This quarter, we did see that shift where only 60% came from MDI because we had a bolus of people coming from 2 pumps that we hope continues. And the other -- we've also been the leader in pediatrics. I think you're kind of asking about where our customers come from. Pediatrics has always been our strength. If you think about the form factor of Omnipod 5, very attractive to parents and to children. We lost a little bit with the lack of an AID system where parents were actually forced again to make that decision between the form factor that's perfect for pediatrics and an AID system. Now they don't have to make that. So we did see a lift, a significant lift in pediatrics as a percentage of our new starts this past quarter. We're excited about that. Those are patients that are newly diagnosed that we want to start on Omnipod and want them to use our products for life. So excited about that trend, excited to be beginning to get competitive to pump users. And I think you asked sort of about people coming back. And as Jim highlighted at the beginning of the call, we did see thousands of people this past quarter have come back to Omnipod. So they left us for a reason. Likely that was an AID reason and the lack of. And so with Omnipod 5, they're coming back to that product. We've seen attrition be very stable, and we're excited about what Omnipod 5 does to strengthen retention with our existing users.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Dalam, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. These are incredibly exciting times at Insulet as Omnipod 5 is out in the market transforming diabetes management for thousands of people, and that number keeps growing. And we could not be more excited to further expand our addressable market with our new innovation in Type 2 for the type 2 community with our basal-only pod. We've got an incredible team, and with significant momentum and to continue to execute on our mission. Thank you, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong revenue performance, new customer growth and strategic progress. We increased our full year revenue outlook and the entire Insulet team continues to execute at a high level and advance our mission. We're focused on finishing the year strong and carrying sustained momentum into 2023. In Q3, we achieved several notable milestones. We once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts which helped us achieve a remarkable 42% year-over-year growth in the U.S., our highest U.S. revenue growth rate in at least a decade. This was driven in large part by an incredible start for our U.S. full market release for our revolutionary Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The feedback on Omnipod 5 from our Podders and their caregivers continues to be fantastic. And of course, we are far from finished. We continue to work to expand access to Omnipod 5 as well as increase the total addressable market for our Omnipod platform. During the quarter, we expanded Omnipod 5's indication down to H2 and secured CE Mark. We also continue to drive growth with Omnipod DASH, both in our international markets and in the U.S., especially in the type 2 diabetes market. Building on that, we are incredibly excited to announce that we have developed and will soon submit a 510(k) for a new basal-only PODD to accelerate our future growth in type 2. It's a clear indication of our commitment to further innovate for people with diabetes and expand our addressable market, and I'll share more about this in a few moments. We could not be more excited about what's yet to come for insulin and our customers. The market enthusiasm for Omnipod 5 is greater than even we anticipated. Demand is coming from all across the market. Our core target market of MDI users is growing ahead of our own forecast and continues to be the greatest source of new customers for us. But we are also seeing significant increases in customer conversions. Current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher rate than we saw with previous product launches, demonstrating that even current Podders see Omnipod 5 as a breakthrough offering. In addition to those coming from MDI, we are seeing significant volumes of customers converting from tubed pump technologies. And in many cases, we are winning back customers who had once been Podders. Thousands of people returning to us and adopting Omnipod 5. And this strong demand also comes from all age groups. We achieved record new customer starts with both adult and pediatric users. In Q3, after only two months of its full market release, Omnipod 5 represented over 80% of U.S. new customer starts compared to over 25% in Q2. This validates the power of Omnipod 5 and the competitive advantages it offers. It is the only tubeless AID system with an adaptive algorithm that works as designed right out of the box, delivering high time and range. The algorithm then learns from each patient's specific usage and automatically personalizes care over the first 2 or 3 pods. Because of that personalization, we are seeing consistent reports of increased time and range, reduction in A1c and markedly low hypoglycemia. It is the combination of clinical effectiveness and our unique Omnipod platform that is fueling our success. As a result, our historical 80-20 mix of those coming from MDI and traditional tubed pumps is changing. In Q3, we saw an estimated 60-40 split due to significantly more competitive takeaways. We're excited by our early progress and are gratified to see how Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management. We have long believed that superior innovation, offering simplicity, discretion and improved outcomes, will drive adoption in our large underpenetrated markets. Omnipod 5 is demonstrating this to be true. Omnipod 5 offers more than any other AID system on the market, including a number of market firsts. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone-controlled AID system the first system that no one has to plug in to access data and the first AID system with a predictive algorithm, our smart bolus calculator, that directly incorporates not just blood glucose levels, but also blood glucose trends. And the stories are inspiring. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who has patients on Omnipod 5, several of whom called her related about the dramatic improvements in their diabetes management. This HCP said she and her patients are amazed with our system. And for the first time, they have been in range 100% of the time. They called their experience \"life-changing\". It's clear Omnipod 5 is making it easier for our customers and their caregivers to manage diabetes, and it's simplifying the interaction between patients and their HCPs. We expect Omnipod 5's contribution to further accelerate growth as we gain additional market traction and increased commercial coverage. To that end, we've made significant strides with access. And by the end of Q3, we secured coverage for over 80% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod 5, well ahead of our initial expectations. We have also experienced a few challenges that we are hitting head on. The incredible market response has placed pressure on our onboarding capabilities, particularly incoming call volumes. Additionally, the voluntary medical device correction we initiated last month for our Omnipod DASH personal diabetes managers in response to the battery issue we identified also slightly elevated call volumes. Given this, we are in the process of carefully reviewing the early field data on the Omnipod 5 controller to ensure it meets our high expectations for safety and user satisfaction. We have received a few inbound calls highlighting a potential issue related to charging the controller. Our work is ongoing and if we ultimately decide to take a particular action, you can expect it to be swift and transparent. Every single aspect of the Omnipod 5 experience is important to us. We are investing to increase our onboarding and call center resources, and are already seeing significantly improved response times. We're driving customer growth through our access and awareness efforts. We have a differentiated business model and a unique leadership position in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Both make access to our technology extremely simple, efficient and affordable, which further differentiates Omnipod during challenging economic times. We have long focused on improving functional access for our customers. As a result, the vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel for both Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5, and the average co-pay is less than $50. Consistent with our commitment to drive expanded access, we are proud to offer our technology at a similar cost to multiple daily injections, while also delivering improved outcomes and quality of life. We also remain focused on the benefits our model provides to physicians and payers. Our pay-as-you-go model makes access easier and more affordable for customers while also eliminating lengthy lock-in periods. At the same time, it provides a superior value proposition and is less expensive for payers. We eliminate the large upfront costs that are common in the durable medical equipment channel with traditional tube pumps, which make those offerings far more expensive, especially since individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years on average. In addition to growing our strong position in the type 1 market, our initiatives are also key drivers of our leadership in the type two space. People with type 2 diabetes are becoming increasingly comfortable with an on-body tubeless device, and we offer an unmatched user experience with Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod. We were pleased with the recent local coverage determination proposal that would provide CGM coverage for basal insulin patients. This proposal, if approved, increases access to CGMs. At the same time, CGM awareness is rising, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this market expansion opportunity. Today, we're a leader in the type 2 space, and now we are taking this a step further with another novel innovation. We have developed a version of Omnipod specifically designed to treat type 2 patients on basal-only therapy, which we plan to submit to the FDA in a few days. It should greatly improve both the user experience and adherence by completely removing the use of needles. It is the perfect product for people with needle phobia and others who may struggle with adherence to daily or weekly injections. The total addressable market for our basal-only pod is estimated to be approximately three million people in the U.S. alone. It leverages our unique Omnipod platform, including auto insertion, comfortable wear and affordable access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, creating a winning first-of-its-kind product for this population. The basal-only pod is incredibly simple to use and requires no controller or phone application to deliver a fixed rate of rapid-acting insulin for 72 continuous hours. This new innovation allows early entry into the type 2 treatment pathway, gets patients comfortable with Pod Therapy and creates a clear pathway for them to adopt other Omnipod product offerings as their insulin needs evolve. Pending regulatory clearance, we plan to begin U.S. commercialization in 2024. Our basal-only pod is expected to drive TAM expansion and revenue growth for years to come while further improving the lives of people with diabetes. This innovation builds upon our leadership position in the type 2 market. During the third quarter, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts. As expected, this percentage is declining given our success driving Omnipod 5 adoption in the type 1 market. However, we remain confident that the simplicity of our Omnipod 5 platform represents a significant competitive advantage that will allow us to expand our customer base in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. As a reminder, like all AID systems, Omnipod 5 is currently indicated for use only for people with type 1 diabetes. However, the number of individuals with type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH remains very strong. Serving the type 2 population is a priority for us, and we are confident the combination of our form factor, access model and innovative product portfolio will continue to drive customer adoption. Another area of focus is advancing our clinical efforts. Our Omnipod 5 randomized controlled trial is progressing well. We're on track to complete enrollment of 120 participants in the U.S. and expect to soon begin enrollment of up to 80 participants in France. We believe the results will demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefits compared to non-AID pump use with CGM. We are confident this will strengthen our position to secure broad reimbursement and pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. As I mentioned, we were excited to receive our expanded indication down to age two for Omnipod 5. We are a leader in the pediatric segment and are confident Omnipod 5 will truly change the lives of these young children and their families. Based on our positive Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study results, I'm happy to share that we expect to begin a type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 in 2023. We continue to advance our robust innovation pipeline with a focus on future AID offerings as well as building our digital and data capabilities. Our iOS integration work is ongoing as is our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's CGMs. We remain committed to building on our product offering and also providing CGM of choice to our customers. Our investments in R&D and innovation are a strategic priority that we fully expect will drive sustainable long-term growth and continued value creation. Our priorities in this area are clear: complete integration with our CGM partners, grow our global addressable markets and create digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. One especially important feature Omnipod 5 offers is real-time usage data feeds. This simplifies diabetes management for patients and their physicians. Looking ahead, we will be in a strong position to use that data to further enhance the patient experience, improve workflows for physicians and build on our competitive advantages. Moving to our international operations. We were pleased to receive CE Mark for Omnipod 5 in September. This represents a major step in our path to deliver Omnipod 5 to people globally. We remain focused on building the necessary cloud-based infrastructure needed to deliver the Omnipod 5 experience while ensuring compliance with local data protection regulations. At the same time, we're developing country-specific launch plans and continuing our work to drive premium reimbursement. We expect to enter our first international market in mid-2023. Given our planned stage approach, we will roll out Omnipod 5 more broadly throughout 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. Global supply chain and macro-related headwinds remain, but we are addressing the needs of our expanding global customer base and supporting the adoption ramp of Omnipod 5. Our team has secured components and built product ahead of our forecasted capacity needs. While this results in increased cost that impact margins, they are necessary to deliver uninterrupted products for our customers. Although our U.S. manufacturing will continue to be a headwind to gross margin given the higher production costs, over the long term, we are confident all of our sites combined will continue to deliver the highest quality product and gross margin expansion. Our U.S. manufacturing has allowed us to build redundancy, capabilities and gain key learnings that are driving efficiency, quality and productivity improvements across all our facilities. In closing, we once again achieved notable financial, commercial and operational milestones and are focused on finishing year strong. With our customers at the center of everything we do, our entire Insulet team is executing our global mission and strengthening our foundation for sustainable long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. It's really early days. So let me start first and foremost with for us, patient safety is absolutely the top priority, right? And in terms of the complaints we're seeing on the charging of the Omnipod 5, it's a small number of complaints. At this point, we're looking at like a couple of dozen complaints, but we're looking at it really closely. And we don't yet have enough data to be able to understand exactly what's going on and what the risk levels are. And so we're looking at it. We're going to fully investigate it. And if we have to take any kind of action we're going to be -- as I said in the prepared comments, we're going to be really fast. We're going to be completely transparent with our customers, completely transparent with investors and obviously with the FDA, right? So I think it's too early to say, and we're looking at it really closely. Travis, I'll start on that, and then I'll ask the team to maybe add some color. I'll just say that Omnipod 5 is such an appealing offer. And I think the general market has been waiting for Omnipod 5. It's revolutionary. You guys all know the value prop, but wearable disposable tubeless patch pump, we competed on that form factor for a long time very successfully. Now we've added automated insulin delivery. So patients no longer have to make the choice between a patch pump and an AID pump. And that -- and you couple that with all of the access to the channel, the reimbursement access and the economics. I don't think that value prop is going to be any less appealing in Q4 or in 2023 than it is today. But I'll ask the team if they want to add color. Yes. In fact, I'll just tag on to Bret's comments. That's a key thing for us in terms of growing the TAM. We obviously -- we have the leading offer right now for patients with type 2 diabetes with Omnipod DASH, as Bret just referred to. But with the basal-only pod, we'll be getting much earlier and much further upstream into the journey of patients. And because it will be the same core Omnipod platform as a product, patients will get used to using our Omnipod product. And then as their insulin needs change, it creates the pathway for them on to our other offerings. So it's a great experience for patients. We're going to dramatically simplify the use of basal insulin for those type 2 patients. And then those customers as they progress in their therapy will have a natural pathway and/or other offerings. So on Basel, yes, it is a 510(k). we were submitting it imminently. Just a couple o. We don't want to get out in front of time lines on approvals. So we don't want -- don't want do that publicly. We'll let you guys know as we get approval and what we're going to do. And then as Bret was saying, there's work to be done on the commercialization plan. And I think the reason for that is it's a new-to-world offer. It's not a new pod. It's an Omnipod platform built on our core offering. But the patient set is new, the channel might be new. The call points might include new call points. There's just a lot to consider in the commercial offering that we need to work through. And so we don't want to jump the gun on talking about these things until we have more certainty. So we'll start with IOS, the iOS, that work is proceeding, as we said last quarter, we're really confident in what we're building there. Our teams have tested it. We've had it out of testing on sample customers. And we'll give you more update as we get closer. That's another one I don't want to jump the gun on and it's our practice to not talk about those dates until they're right in our hands. And so but we're very confident that our iOS offering is going to be very strong, And we want to get it to market as quickly as we can. On the basal pod, I'll just say that -- maybe you can -- maybe the guys can remind me of the question We're not ready to talk about pricing. I will say about the basal pod is that because it's based on our core Omnipod platform, it has all the same IP wrapped into it all the same IP protection. What's different about it is that it's basal-only. And so it doesn't take a controller. It has a basal rate built into it. It makes it really simple for -- just to give you some color to what we're picturing here. It's because it's the Omnipod with the auto insertion, it's really easy to put on anybody has a needle phobia. Look, I'm needle phobic, right? And I warn the Omnipod, I can't fill go in. And that's what we're going for here. Is anybody that is on basal-only therapy and has to do daily or with the injections who has needle phobia doesn't really want to do that. And the beauty of this basal-only pod is it's going to make that insertion really easy and then allow the customer to get their basal rate on a continuous basis over 72 hours. It's very disruptive -- and it's -- we think it's going to be an extremely simple experience and really change and potentially lift should have a huge benefit to their care and a huge potential benefit to payers. But there's a lot to be worked through. So we're not going to talk about pricing. We're not going to talk about COGS and those things. We'll give you guys more detail as we get closer. Thanks, Matt. Look, I think as we said earlier in the call, customers no longer need to choose. So a number of customers have forever been drawn to the great simplicity and elegance and ease of use of the pod form factor. And with Omnipod 5, we're offering a fantastic AID algorithm. And so to get AID therapy and the preferred form factor, to get into the channel they want, to get it with the economics they want. And so it's actually not surprising to us to see a number of people switch from tubed pump offerings. The offering is just so easy to use and it delivers great clinical outcomes, incredible ease of use and great economics. And so we've had -- we were pleased to see the rate of switching in the quarter. In terms of forward look, I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. But as I said earlier, I don't think that this -- the Omnipod 5 offering will become any less appealing either to customers coming from MDI or to customers who might be using the tooth pump who went there because they wanted an AID offer. So we're very confident in the robustness of the offer. So on international, there's a number of things going on. We're very pleased to get the CE Mark. So that's no longer a hurdle we have to get over. We have CE Mark, and that's good to go for Omnipod 5. As we've said before, what we're working on now in terms of Omnipod 5 launch is making sure that we have the right cloud infrastructure that delivers the right. If you think about the Omnipod 5 offering, it's a very holistic offering for customers. So we want to make sure that we're delivering the full Omnipod 5 experience in the markets where we launch. And we also obviously have to be comporting both with European and with any local market data privacy and security regulations. And so that's work that's being built. We don't need the RCT that we talk about to do that. So we'll be -- if I could just go back for a second to Omnipod 5 ex U.S., as we've said, we'll be launching in Europe in the middle of '23 and then we'll stage those launches to make sure that we have the right launch plan for each market as we cascade the second half of '23 into '24 and launch those markets. The randomized controlled trial is designed to make sure that we have the right kind of clinical evidence to position Omnipod 5 appropriately in ex U.S. markets. And so we're confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate benefit of our AID algorithm and the pod form factor against non-AID pumps and CGM alone. And that's where we're building evidence, which is a huge effort for us or a huge -- it's a huge emphasis for us to continue to build evidence for Omnipod 5. Thanks, Dalam, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. These are incredibly exciting times at Insulet as Omnipod 5 is out in the market transforming diabetes management for thousands of people, and that number keeps growing. And we could not be more excited to further expand our addressable market with our new innovation in Type 2 for the type 2 community with our basal-only pod. We've got an incredible team, and with significant momentum and to continue to execute on our mission. Thank you, and have a great evening."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Q3 marked another record-breaking quarter. Our global team continues to execute at a high level. And Omnipod 5 is proving to be a life-changing new option for people with diabetes. We're focused on finishing the year strong and entering 2023 with momentum. We generated 29% revenue growth in the third quarter finishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 30%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 480 basis point headwind compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 42%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. This includes a growing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the pod given we provide the PDM at no charge in the pharmacy channel. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $16 million benefit associated with the initial quarter of Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was primarily driven by conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we benefited from some customers getting both their starter kits and first refills in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were over 95% of our total U.S. new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod 5 at over 80% and an Omnipod DASH at almost 15%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to almost 75% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9%, within our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by ongoing AID competition. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,440 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 140 basis points unfavorable versus our prior guide. During Q3, our estimated global attrition remained consistent and utilization was higher, driven by the Omnipod 5 ramp benefit mentioned. Drug Delivery revenue declined 4% and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 55.3%, representing an approximate 1,300 basis point decrease including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $37 million charge or approximately 1,100 basis points related to the voluntary medical device correction. The aggregate $37 million charge in Q3 primarily reflects the estimated replacement units, shipping and reclaim costs of the PDMs for global Omnipod DASH users. This charge is within the estimated $35 million to $45 million we included in our October 8-K filing. We no longer expect any material additional operating expenses to be recorded in Q4 of this year or in 2023, as we previously had estimated. Excluding the Q3 medical device correction charge, adjusted gross margin was 66.1%, representing a 240 basis point decrease. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations, higher manufacturing costs associated with Drug Delivery and higher mix of costs given Omnipod 5 ramping. These costs were partially offset by growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium. Operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectations to support higher demand for Omnipod 5 and were higher than Q3 of last year due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, development work to advance our innovation pipeline and costs to scale our business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which exclude the voluntary medical device correction, were 11.6% and 18.4%, respectively. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $720 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising our total company full year revenue growth to a range of 18% to 19%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 24%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 30% to 31%. We expect revenue growth to be driven primarily by strong Omnipod 5 new customer starts and conversions to Omnipod 5 from both Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod as well as increasing Omnipod DASH volume and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance and now expect a range of 11% to 12%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,200 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance range and now expect a decline of 37% to 35%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%. On a year-over-year basis, we expect our gross margin will be impacted by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to ramping Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenue. These headwinds will be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results for the next couple of years. And as a result, we expect 2023 gross margin to be similar to this year. Excluding certain legal and CEO transition costs, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year due to the investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5 as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits. And for 2023, given the expectation for gross margin and the continued investments to launch Omnipod 5 in the U.S. and international markets as well as ongoing innovation, clinical, commercial and support functions to scale the business and costs associated with our implementing a new enterprise reporting system, we expect operating margins to be similar to 2022. Our commitment to margin expansion continues, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. Lastly, we now expect capital expenditures to be relatively level with prior year versus our previous expectation of a slight increase. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 11% to 14%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 26%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 500 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 15% to 18%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be nominal as the majority of our orders for the year have already been fulfilled. In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. These are exciting times, given the full market release of Omnipod 5, the recent milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made advancing our innovation pipeline. We're focused on continuing to execute at a high level and delivering on our mission. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions. That's great. If I could just pick up on the question around 2023 revenue growth. And it is really, as Jim, Bret said, AID is the difference maker and that shows up in the different growth rates between the regions. For U.S., we've got a lot of momentum. Obviously, as Jim and Bret just said, and we had in the prepared remarks, we're seeing increased demand with MDI as well as conversions from our existing customers, legacy product and then the competitive switches here. So a lot of momentum in the U.S. I think the way to think about 2023 -- we'll just give some color here. We're not going to provide guidance. We'll do that in our Q4 call in February. But some color to think about at this point is U.S. carrying a lot of momentum. We should see larger dollar growth in 2023. Need to normalize that for a couple of the volume benefits we've seen here in Q2 and Q3. And that should settle us out to start right now in that low 20% growth range for the U.S. And then as you said, OUS without AID, we're thinking about really consistent. We think we'll continue to grow really well with DASH in the markets that we're in. We are bringing Omnipod 5 midyear or to start to bring it to our international markets. That rollout will continue through 2024. But where that puts us for international is high single digits, low double digits range. I think it would be a good place to start for now. And of course, both those regions we'll be monitoring here throughout Q4 and getting more confidence in some of these really dynamic metrics, as Bret just highlighted. So we get a lot of things changing pretty dynamically with Omnipod 5. So we'll monitor those see where they shake out and put our guidance in place for 2023. And then Drug Delivery, just to hit that as well. At this point, we would expect drug delivery to do about the same decline next year as it did this year. So that will put us in kind of that mid-$20 million range, about a $25 million to $30 million reduction year-over-year. That's what we're experiencing this year, and we would think about the same next year. So that sets us up for some color on 2023. But as I said, we'll provide the official guide when we get to February next year. Yes. You bet, Larry. So just starting with this volume that we got -- additional volume we got around Omnipod 5. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is some of it is timing because we only had Omnipod 5 in full market release for 2 months out of the quarter. And when people -- when some people start on Omnipod 5, as it turns out a good percentage of them ended up getting their starter kits as well as their first refill order in the quarter. So that gave us some additional volume. And then we also had some retail pharmacy stocking that is going to happen over time as more and more retail channels start to stock the product. So those are the 2 drivers of additional volume in the quarter. Your question on whether we think that will continue in Q4. We're going to monitor it very closely. We've got a lot of scenarios here of how this could play out. What we're anticipating in the guide, and that could push us either to the high end or the low end is how many of these people either wait a month to get their next script. Some people may order in the middle of the month or some people may immediately just get their next script. And so we're going to have to watch some of these dynamics and see if this volume can continue into Q4. And so just a lot to monitor, a lot of changing dynamics with Omnipod 5. We're very happy to get the volume here. At the end of the day, we are a volume business in the pharmacy channel. We're doing a lot to drive volume, both increasing access as well as all the things we're doing around innovation and awareness as well as the clinical work we're doing. You saw us announce this quarter down to H2, doing a lot of things to drive volumes here. And so we're really excited at the front end to be in the first -- just the first 2 months, and we're going to monitor this. We do think we'll get the benefit in Q4 as well. But should be somewhat offset by those people in Q3 that either take a little bit longer or take a whole month to place their next order. And then, Larry, you talked a little bit more about the Q4 guide. If you normalize for these volume benefits, then you're right, we are in about low 30s growth rate here on a normalized basis for Q2. And then as you look forward to Q4, we certainly have a much tougher comp. We had a significantly very strong quarter in Q4 last year. So we have to keep that in mind. And then, of course, we're at the front end of Omnipod 5. And so we don't want to get out in front of that. We're going to continue to monitor it, but we're really excited to see what can happen in Q4. And then as I mentioned, the key for 2023 is law of large numbers. We're planning for growing the dollar growth of the business in 2023, and that settles us out in that low 20s. And I think that's a good place to start. Again, we're not guiding. We're just trying to give some color, and we'll give our official guidance in February next year, which will give us another whole quarter here in Q4 and the start of Q1 to really understand some of these changing dynamics. Eric, you bet. Happy to talk about the '23 color that we're providing to help everyone here before we get the guidance, Jayson, that's on a constant currency basis. And so obviously, not going to be factoring in where we think FX is going to go at this point. So just think about the color there on a constant currency basis and then I don't know if you want to talk to Basel, to Sure. On the pricing and pricing, which we're not. Marie, it's Wayde. I can start that one, and then I'm sure Bret or Jim might want to jump in. So given that we're just in the first couple of months of our full market release, we are just getting started here. So we have seen -- just like in all the channels, we mentioned the competitive switches as well as MDI conversions of existing Omnipodders has also been incredibly strong even just in the first few months and tracking them through their journey coming to Omnipod 5. So the way we're thinking about this right now is if we continue to see accelerated rates of conversion -- converting customers, it will probably last throughout 2023. And the majority of them should be through in 2023. But again, in the first couple of months here, we're going to be watching this as we are with many of these different dynamics to these really strong converting trends continue after the first couple of months or do they ebb and flow over the next few years. But if we continue with these trends, we should have most customers converted by the end of 2023."

            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "Travis, it's Bret. So as you know, for years, we've talked about this 80-20 split where 80% of all of our new starts come from MDI. That has been our focus. It will continue to be a focus. But as Jim said, we don't have to -- or patients don't have to make that choice now between the superior form factor of Omnipod and an AID system, so they can get it all. And so it's not surprising to us the split changed from 80/20. We'll see where it settles in. We don't know yet if that -- if there's a bolus of to pump users that wanted to try Omnipod or if it's going to settle in there, it's likely to settle in somewhere different than 80-20, but we're excited to finally be offering a choice to those that chose an AID system, but really preferred the form factor of Omnipod. So we'll see where it settles in, in the coming quarters. But again, it's really an exciting development that we're getting these two pump conversions. Robbie, I can take that one. This is Bret. So as far as the macro trends in the field, we're not feeling it. We're in the midst of an Omnipod 5 launch, demand is incredibly high. The team is excited and patients are wanting to started out 2.5. I can't say that we're feeling any of the effects of a lingering COVID or any sort of macro inflationary recession-type concerns. But as you mentioned, our business model is different. And we've spent years planning a scalable, affordable business model that would allow for patients to upgrade from existing Omnipod products and start. And so we've got very low co-pays that remained below $50 on average, with the vast majority of all co-pays in the pharmacy channel being less than $5. We've said that with DASH and really the Omnipod 5 co-pays almost mirror DASH exactly where we price Omnipod 5 at parity. You've got added to the contracts with payers and pricing is very similar as far as out-of-pocket goes for our users. As far as basal-only pod, I don't know if that's the question you're asking about out-of-pocket and co-pays. We're not there yet. We'll be building reimbursement and having discussions with payers now that we've mentioned this basal-only pod. But we do have some basal usage with our existing products, primarily DASH is type 2 axis. It's very good for DASH, and they'll take DASH, they'll customize it and use it as a basal-only pump. And that reimbursement is the exact same for type 1s and type 2s for basal and for insulin intensive. So more to come on the commercialization plans of our basal-only pod, but we'll be building reimbursement next year with that product. Margaret, it's Bret. So we're excited to start to share more about the basal-only pod. Jim mentioned at the beginning of the call some of what we're excited about. And that is although we've got access today and some basal-only users will use a product like DASH, it was not built for basal-only usage. And there's a lot of complexity in pumps, and we want to take that complexity away for anybody that wants to start on a basal-only pod. So as Jim mentioned, it won't have a controller. That's very key because a lot of the complexity with pumps is around settings. There are no settings with a basal-only pod. So it's going to be designed and for the basal-only user, whether that's in endocrinology, primary care, it's focused on simplicity. And so we'll start to share more about what its form factor looks like. As Jim mentioned, we'll be submitting this product to the FDA in the coming days. And we're just excited to start educating you on what it's all about, and we'll do that in the future. But do want to highlight how excited we are to capture patients at the moment they need insulin, the moment they need an injection so they can avoid ejections altogether throughout their life on Omnipod-like products as they progress in their type 2 diabetes. Kyle, thanks for the question. So we've got a really strong type 2 offering today, as you know, with access that mirrors type 1 in the pharmacy channel. So start there. Got a really good product with DASH. It's got an indication for all insulin requiring patients, great coverage. We're going to add to that offering with getting an indication for Omnipod 5 as we've started that trial, that clinical. And we're going to add the basal-only pod in 2024. And we think what that does for us is it does allow us to capture patients at the moment they need insulin. It's too early to say what the commercial model will look like for that product. But we know we can capture some of it today with just the existing sales force and team that we have as many of those patients do reside in endocrinology and we do call on a small number of primary care physicians with the existing sales teams. So more to come there. I think it does just depend on how quickly we can build reimbursement, how quickly that launch goes and then how we start to think about primary care and capturing patients where they reside. But we'll talk more about that probably later in 2023. There's a lot to consider there. It's really exciting. It more than doubles our TAM, with more than 3 million patients in the U.S. that are basal-only. So we're excited about it, and there's a lot to consider as far as how we commercialize it in 2024. Yes. Chris, great question. The reimbursement today for basal-only patients, the answer to that is there really is no difference between insulin-intensive type 2 patients and basal patients as far as reimbursement goes. However, Omnipod was not built with basal only in mind. And so while there are some patients using it for basal only, just wasn't really built that way. And again, there's complexity with PDMs, there's complexities with settings. And so if you're going to use a product like DASH today, although it's reimbursed, you effectively have to kind of program DASH to say, look, we're going to get rid of all the mealtime features, a lot of the features and just use it as a basal-only product. So not ideal for basal-only wasn't built that way. It does seem complex some to like a primary care physician, that simply wants to write a prescription, which is what they would do with basal-only pod. And so while the reimbursement is there, we plan on changing it because it will be a different code. And so it will be a different reimbursed rate at a different price. We just haven't -- we're just not ready to talk about that. We've got work to do before we get confident in talking about what that will be, what we'll contract for. As far as the CGM goes, that's a lift for us because, as you know, CGMs provide the user with tremendous information that requires them to act. It shows physicians' time and range. And that's going to be really valuable for driving demand for a product like basal-only pod, but our initial thinking is we really don't want those 2 products to speak to each other because it does add complexity as you mentioned. And so the thought on basal-only pod to keep it as simple as possible as featured as possible. We want a position to write a prescription and that really is it. And so that means no communication with no reports, no settings. That's what we're thinking about today. And we think that's the best way to go broad and capture that marketplace. Matt, thanks for the question. So as we sort of highlighted, we are the leader in driving penetration from MDI, and that has always been our focus. So the bulk of our new starts. And for us, a new start is the first time you start on an Omnipod product. We don't count renewals. We don't count other shipments. If you start on Omnipod, new start once in your lifetime. And our focus has always been MDI, and that's where the 80-20 number has come from, where 80% of those new starts have come from MDI. This quarter, we did see that shift where only 60% came from MDI because we had a bolus of people coming from 2 pumps that we hope continues. And the other -- we've also been the leader in pediatrics. I think you're kind of asking about where our customers come from. Pediatrics has always been our strength. If you think about the form factor of Omnipod 5, very attractive to parents and to children. We lost a little bit with the lack of an AID system where parents were actually forced again to make that decision between the form factor that's perfect for pediatrics and an AID system. Now they don't have to make that. So we did see a lift, a significant lift in pediatrics as a percentage of our new starts this past quarter. We're excited about that. Those are patients that are newly diagnosed that we want to start on Omnipod and want them to use our products for life. So excited about that trend, excited to be beginning to get competitive to pump users. And I think you asked sort of about people coming back. And as Jim highlighted at the beginning of the call, we did see thousands of people this past quarter have come back to Omnipod. So they left us for a reason. Likely that was an AID reason and the lack of. And so with Omnipod 5, they're coming back to that product. We've seen attrition be very stable, and we're excited about what Omnipod 5 does to strengthen retention with our existing users."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Dilem. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 second quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking, and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as CEO of Insulet. This past quarter, we exceeded our revenue expectations resulting from sustained momentum across our business. We are halfway through the year and the entire Insulet team is executing at a high level. We increased our full year outlook for US Omnipod, delivered record US and global new customer starts, had our second highest new customer starts quarter internationally and meaningfully advanced each of our strategic imperatives. Accomplishing this was no easy task, given the challenging global macro environment that we and other companies are facing. We are incredibly excited to have recently entered full market release for Omnipod 5. And now our differentiated transformative technology is available broadly through retail pharmacies. The results to-date have been amazing. Omnipod 5 is proving to be the game changer we thought it would be. Customer and healthcare provider feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and our teams are doing a remarkable job executing the launch. Our CE Mark submission review is progressing very well, and we are in the final stretch toward approval. This represents a key milestone in our plan to bring Omnipod 5 to people with diabetes around the world. This approval is one step in our strategy to participate in the international AID market, which is being driven largely by CGM reimbursement. We have also advanced our clinical efforts. Our FDA submission for an expanded indication for Omnipod 5 in the US down to age two is progressing very well, and we are confident in the near-term clearance. The value that Omnipod 5 can deliver to young children and their families is abundantly clear, and we\u2019re thrilled to soon bring Omnipod 5 to this highly vulnerable population. We shared compelling data at ADA, demonstrating how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for the Type 2 insulin requirement population, a market segment that is further adopting Omnipod due to our unique value proposition. And in the Type 1 population, we are currently enrolling for a 200-patient 3-months randomized controlled trial in France and the US to demonstrate superior efficacy for Omnipod 5 compared to non-AID pumps and CGM alone. Lastly, we broke ground at our future Malaysian manufacturing facility, which will strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities and redundancy, as well as support our international expansion strategy. Before moving into a broader view of the quarter on our progress, I want to take a step back and reflect on my first two months as CEO. I was aware of the strength and commitment of the entire Insulet team from my three years on the Board of Directors. Now that I\u2019m CEO, I\u2019m even more impressed. Our global teams are exceptional. The shared commitment to our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes is inspiring and is pervasive throughout our organization. Diabetes is a growing global epidemic and Insulet\u2019s ability to serve unmet needs and provide improved outcomes has never been more important. It is clear that we have the team, the product portfolio, the innovation roadmap, and most importantly, the passion to improve millions of lives, and I\u2019m excited and privileged to lead Insulet on that journey. Expanding access and awareness are keys to driving our business forward. Despite improvements over the last few years, only a small percentage of people with Type 1 diabetes globally benefit from insulin delivery technology. Access and awareness are important levers that will significantly drive increased penetration over the coming years. We are making terrific progress building awareness and securing coverage globally, including broad coverage for Omnipod 5 in the US. We\u2019ve built a unique leadership position in the US pharmacy channel, which improves functional access for both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations. The vast majority of our US customers continue to pay less than $50 each month through the pharmacy for Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5, with many paid nothing. We\u2019ve eliminated lengthy lock-in periods and upfront costs that are common in the DME channel, and our pay-as-you-go model provides easier and more affordable access for our customers and removes risk for payers. And we are delivering this easier access, combined with lower costs, while also delivering an improved customer experience and better outcomes. That\u2019s a winning combination and one that resonates with people using multiple daily injections, a population from which we continue to capture approximately 80% of our new customers. Our pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business models also connect with people with Type 2 diabetes. We are acutely focused on making access simple and more affordable, providing an unmatched form factor and generating clinical evidence that supports what Omnipod can do for the Type 2 population. Because the Omnipod offering is so compelling, during the second quarter, Type 2 users represented almost 30% of our US new customer starts. As expected, this is a percentage reduction from prior quarters, because Omnipod 5 is indicated for use with people with Type 1 diabetes, as is the case with all AID systems. Therefore, we expect the mix percentage of new customers to change as more people with Type 1 adopt Omnipod 5. We saw this begin in Q2 and we\u2019re excited to see it continue now that we are in full market release. Nevertheless, we continue to see a strong number of new customers with Type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH, and we remain confident in our ability to further penetrate this underserved population. A major component of our awareness efforts is our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. We ramped our DTC program ahead of the full market release of Omnipod 5 and have since accelerated our spend. This has resulted in more people wanting to learn about Omnipod 5 and the impact it can have on their lives and those they care about. We expect our DTC efforts for Omnipod 5 will be even more effective than what we have experienced for Omnipod DASH. We are also using DTC to drive awareness for Omnipod in select international markets. Customers love Omnipod 5. That\u2019s because of the number of firsts it brings to the market. It\u2019s the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone controlled AID system, the first system no one has to plug in to access data and the first with a smart bolus calculator to directly incorporate trends. We\u2019ve heard humbling and inspiring stories from countless customers and we\u2019re just getting started. I want to share a couple of stories we\u2019ve heard from individuals adopting Omnipod 5 and how impactful it\u2019s been for their lives. An individual who had been using an insulin pump for over a decade and recently switched to Omnipod 5, told us that after 10 years of worrying about visible tubes, getting caught on door knobs and dealing with the nuisances of being tethered to his pump. He now spends more time focusing on life. His outcomes have improved, including his overnight blood sugar, and he no longer has to live his life with diabetes top of mind. We also heard from a physician who has lived with Type 1 diabetes for 43 years. He noted that during that time, he\u2019s seen treatment options evolve and change, but Omnipod 5 is the largest leap in improvement he has ever seen. This very experienced physician called our system \"remarkable\". These two stories are just a small representation of the amazing testimonials we continue to receive from Omnipod 5 users. There\u2019s a common thread that connects all the stories we hear from users. Omnipod 5 is redefining how people manage their disease and it\u2019s making their lives simpler. The impact Omnipod 5 is having is clear and it\u2019s powerful. In Q2, the first full quarter of limited market release, Omnipod 5 already represented over 25% of our US new customer starts. We expect that percentage to accelerate with the US full market release as we now sell through a broader distribution channel, including all of our wholesalers that supply products to approximately 88,000 retail pharmacies. We are also having outstanding success securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Today, we have over 55% covered lives for Omnipod 5, which is well ahead of where we were when launching Omnipod DASH, and represents a significant increase from Q1. Our team has done an amazing job, and we expect to make meaningful progress the rest of this year and into the next. Omnipod 5 is now fully available through retail, specialty and mail order pharmacies to anyone with a prescription and coverage in line with our expected timing. Our limited market release provided key learnings about how healthcare professionals and customers interact with our product on board and virtually trained, all of which are dramatically easier than ever before. Already, the small improvements we have implemented are resonating with users, especially those coming from a tubed pump who transition to a more simplified experience. In fact, one of the key learnings is that, physicians and patients can rely on the automation of the system to do the work for them during the first few days. Omnipod 5 works with the first pod out of the box and then it learns and adapts to personalized care for each individual user, typically within the first or second pod change. This ability to automatically personalize therapy clearly differentiates Omnipod 5 from all other systems on the market. Quite simply, Omnipod 5 eliminates significant burden and shared work between patients and their physicians. Although our target market continues to be MDI, not surprisingly, many of our Omnipod 5 new customers come from competitive pumps and people are loving the experience. The clinical benefits from Omnipod 5 were clearly demonstrated by the Preschool Pivotal Extension Data we shared at ADA that built on the strong results we saw during the study\u2019s initial phase, which were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Diabetes Care. During the first three-month phase of the study as well as through the end of the extension phase, patients achieved an average A1c of 6.9% compared to 7.4% at baseline. The data clearly demonstrated these individuals maintained their improved levels through the extension phase. Time in range and percent time in hypoglycemia also showed sustained improvements during the extension phase, demonstrating the durability and power of Omnipod 5 for this critical population. We look forward to receiving our preschool indication for Omnipod 5 this year. The engagement around Omnipod 5 at ADA was really something to see. We met with hundreds of attendees at our booth and held a product theater that was standing room only. It was here where we shared patient case studies and the real-world experience of HCPs who have had remarkable success with Omnipod 5. The overwhelming feedback was that Omnipod 5 clearly stood out as the most robust AID offering. And many of the MDI and tubed pump users in attendance have since adopted our technology. Overall, ADA marked another opportunity to highlight our products and clinical accomplishments that demonstrate how Omnipod can change the lives of people with diabetes around the globe and how important and meaningful our mission is. We are also advancing our innovation pipeline. We\u2019re developing the next generations of Omnipod 5, furthering our iOS development and working closely with our CGM partners, Dexcom and Abbott. Our innovation priorities are focused on growing our addressable market, building our next-generation AID technology, and creating digital and data-driven products to make diabetes management easier for our customers and their physicians. Moving on to our international operations. Our Omnipod 5 CE Mark submission is moving swiftly through review, and we expect approval over the next couple of months. This is an important milestone for our international business as we work to bring Omnipod 5 to people around the world. CE Mark clears the way for us to focus on completing a cloud-based infrastructure that is compatible with local data protection regulations, developing country-specific launch plans, channel and customer experience approaches and seeking reimbursement. Omnipod 5 is a transformative platform, and we look forward to entering our first international markets in mid-2023. We will take a staged approach to entering markets so we can ensure successful launches in each country in which we operate. In addition to bringing Omnipod 5 to global markets, we continue working to enter new markets and recently launched Omnipod DASH in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Omnipod is now available in 24 countries, and we\u2019re building local teams and advancing our regulatory and reimbursement goals. These efforts will serve us well as we bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and strengthen our competitive position. Lastly, the global supply chain and inflation, each presents significant challenges to Insulet as they do for most manufacturers across a range of industries. However, we continue to navigate these headwinds and increase our resiliency, ensuring ample product supply, including supporting the Omnipod 5 launch and the needs of our growing global customer base. We are mitigating supply risks by securing components well ahead of our capacity needs. While this comes at an increased cost that will have a near-term impact on margins, we are taking the appropriate steps in these turbulent times to ensure uninterrupted supply for our current and future customers. The footprint of our global manufacturing operations is one of our many competitive advantages, and we advanced our efforts to further strengthen our capabilities. We recently broke ground at a new manufacturing location in Malaysia, the future facility located in Johor Bahru represents an investment of approximately $200 million over the next five years, will provide approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and house more than 500 full-time employees at capacity. Our regional sourcing strategy includes the use of local suppliers for components and we have already outlined our plans to utilize environmentally responsible and resource-efficient materials in our building design. We expect to begin production at this new facility by the end of 2024. This facility supports our operational strategy to increase our global manufacturing redundancy, build our global talent base and support future international market expansion efforts. In closing, the second quarter marked a number of financial, commercial and operational milestones. Our entire Insulet team continues to execute with an unwavering commitment to our mission and to our customers. We are proud of all the work and accomplishments we achieved this quarter, and now we are setting the stage for sustainable long-term growth. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Jim. We\u2019ve made great progress in Q2 as we delivered another quarter of record US and global new customer starts and achieved a number of notable milestones, including the US full commercial launch of Omnipod 5 within the time range we expected. We are advancing each of our strategic imperatives, navigating supply chain and inflation challenges and maintaining our focus on fulfilling our mission. We generated 18% revenue growth in the second quarter, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 390 basis point headwind compared to Q2 of last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 31%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the US pharmacy channel, including initial contributions from Omnipod 5. Q2 revenue included an estimated $7 million of net channel inventory build, which consisted of Omnipod 5 inventory build, partially offset by a reduction of classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH inventory at our distributors. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 of the prior year included a favorable comparison for an approximate $2 million catch-up in rebates from earlier periods. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined, were up sequentially to over 90% of our total US new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod DASH at approximately 65% and Omnipod 5, over 25%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 65% of our total US volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9% at the low end of our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition headwinds and the pandemic\u2019s compounding impact over the past year. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,130 basis point headwind over prior year. During Q2, both our estimated global attrition and pod utilization remain consistent. Drug Delivery revenue declined 36%, in line with our guidance range. Gross margin was 63.6%, representing a 580 basis point decrease or 640 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we ramp our US manufacturing operations, a higher warranty accrual for costs related to Omnipod DASH PDMs for battery lives as they age, as well as higher costs given the mix impact of Omnipod 5 ramping, all partially offset by growing volume through the US pharmacy channel. As a reminder, the higher mix of volume at our US manufacturing facility, growing Omnipod 5 volume and the higher component costs included in our inventory balance will continue to pressure gross margin for the remainder of this year as we sell the product out of inventory. Operating expenses were above our expectations due to $27.3 million of legal costs as well as $3.4 million of costs associated with the Retirement and Advisory Services of the former CEO. Excluding these charges, operating expenses were higher than Q2 of last year, due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, international expansion, continued investments in innovation and scaling our global business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q2, which exclude the legal and CEO transition costs, were 1.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Both were impacted by the gross margin pressures and increase in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency. Turning to cash and liquidity. During the quarter, we secured an additional $10 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Overall, our financial position is strong and provides flexibility to invest across our business to fuel sustainable long-term growth. Now, turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising full year revenue to a range of 14% to 17%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 23% to 26%. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased Omnipod DASH volume through the pharmacy channel, the benefit of our pay-as-you-go model, which should expand both our Type 1 and Type 2 customer base, and increasing volume for Omnipod 5, following our full market release. As a reminder, significant revenue from the Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are reducing our full year revenue guidance to 9% to 12%, related to the impact of AID competition in our international markets. Revenue growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, which is sold in all of our markets. We expect international revenue growth will be the highest in the fourth quarter of the year \u2013 due to an easier comparison as well as an expected improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, for our drug delivery revenue range, we are lowering full year guidance to a decline of 35% to 40%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. We now expect a range of 65% to 66%, representing a decline of 200 basis points from our previous expectation as we continue to encounter higher costs associated with ramping US manufacturing and Omnipod 5 volumes, higher warranty costs, and the ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures in the broader macro environment. We continue to execute strategies to partially offset these headwinds, while also ensuring we have more than enough capacity to meet expected demand. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin will be impacted by product line mix from lower drug delivery revenue, higher costs associated with our US manufacturing ramp, product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5, manufacturing components due to inflation and warranty costs. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the US pharmacy channel. We expect unfavorable product mix, the US manufacturing ramp, as well as inflation and supply chain macro-related headwinds to continue to impact our results for the next couple of years. We expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year, driven by ongoing investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5, and increasing DTC advertising, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. Excluding the legal and CEO transition costs, we now expect operating margin to be in the high single-digits as a result of the gross margin reduction and the macro environment creating inflationary and foreign exchange pressures. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase slightly due to ongoing investments in key areas of our business. Turning to our third quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 17% to 20%, including Omnipod growth of 18% to 21%. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate the impact will be approximately 500 basis points on a reported basis for total revenue. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 24% to 27%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model, growing Omnipod DASH volume through the US pharmacy channel and ramping contributions from Omnipod 5. We expect Q3 international Omnipod growth of 7% to 10%, driven by the ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by competitive AID headwinds and the compounding impact on new customer starts in 2021 and into 2022, largely due to the pandemic. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,300 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to decline 14% to 5% as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic levels. In conclusion, we\u2019ve achieved a number of critical milestones that further position Insulet for growth. While there continues to be macro-related challenges, these are exciting times with the full market release of Omnipod 5, now fully available through retail pharmacies, and soon, CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 internationally. We\u2019re on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer growth, while also investing in key areas throughout our global business, in order to drive future growth and sustain long-term value creation. With that, Dilem, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter and you know the full market release of Omnipod 5. Wayde, I actually wanted to start with the margins, given that that was you know a pretty big change here. So, I\u2019m totally understandable what\u2019s happening this year to the gross margin and the OpEx. I\u2019d love some color you know on how you\u2019re thinking about you know gross margin and operating margin in Q3 and Q4. And when do you think you can get back to that 70% gross margin that you recently had? And how are you thinking about leverage beyond 2022? Thanks for taking the question.\nWayde McMillan: Hi, Larry. So for our margins, as you mentioned, we stepped them down this quarter for both some micro and macro issues. You know I think as has been well publicized across many companies, the macro environment is tough, both from an inflationary and foreign exchange, and we\u2019ve felt that as well. We also have a couple of things that impacted us in the quarter. You saw us talk about our warranty increase on our PDMs as well as some of the volume that we\u2019re increasing in our Acton facility. And then just a highlight for folks. You saw us take down our gross margin guidance for drug delivery. That\u2019s a higher margin product line. And so when we reduce revenue guidance there, that\u2019s a headwind for us. And then we\u2019ve increased our volume for Omnipod 5. Our expectations for Omnipod 5 are growing even above what we originally thought. And cost of goods sold are slightly higher for Omnipod 5 as well. So, although that\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re growing volumes with Omnipod 5, it is a headwind to our cost of goods sold. So that creates about a 2% impact to gross margins, and that really is what drops through to operating margins. We also have other inflationary headwinds throughout operating expenses, given the wage environment as well as services and other increased costs out there that most companies are dealing with. So that\u2019s the reason that we changed our guidance. It\u2019s a little too early to tell what expectations will be beyond 2022, we have to monitor closely the macro environment here. What we do know is that, we are paying higher cost for inputs, raw materials and components to build capacity. And you can see it in our inventory as we continue to grow inventory, our operations teams are doing a great job of identifying capacity and growing inventory in this environment, but it is coming at a higher cost. And with the inventory that we\u2019ve built, a lot of that is deferred over a six-month period of time. And so that\u2019s already starting to impact what our gross margins will be next year. So, although we\u2019re very happy to be building inventory and developing extra capacity, it does come at a higher cost. And so that\u2019s going to impact us for some time. But we\u2019re not going to look out beyond that at this point, Larry. I think we\u2019ve got to monitor the macro environment and see what it looks like. What we are going to commit to is that over time, we will continue to expand gross margins and operating margins, that\u2019s a key focus for us. It may not be in any particular year, especially with the macro headwinds that we\u2019re dealing with today. But you can count on us to continue to expand margins over time.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Robert Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. As it relates to the US new patient starts, I\u2019m surprised, Omnipod 5 was already over 25%. I would imagine the exit rate is even higher than that. Maybe you could just talk about the types of patients you\u2019re seeing? Are these new to therapy? Are these switching from other therapies? How high a percentage of new patient mix do you think Omnipod 5 will settle out as? And is this in the short-term at all changing your Type 1 and Type 2 mix? Thanks a lot.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the congratulations, too. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to say about how the rates are going to settle out. We\u2019re very happy with adoption of Omnipod 5 across the board. As we said, you know more than 80% of our new customer starts are patients coming from MDI, and so \u2013 you know that\u2019s our target market. We are seeing a high percentage of patients converting from Omnipod DASH. And you know to me, that\u2019s a great sign of demand, because what it shows is that, patients who are already on the Omnipod experience, we know they\u2019ve been waiting for Omnipod 5. And so we\u2019re actually, I think, getting a somewhat higher percentage of conversions already. And if you remember, during limited market release, what we\u2019ve been telling the market is the fastest way to get an Omnipod 5 is to get an Omnipod DASH and then convert. So we\u2019re seeing that very well. And we are seeing conversions from other tubed pump offerings. And so we\u2019re getting a mix across the board, and we\u2019re really happy with that.\nBret Christensen: Hey, Robbie, it\u2019s Bret. Just to draft in here a little bit. You asked about the exit rate. So yeah, good pickup there. 25% was our mix for the entire quarter. So remember, we just entered a full market release. And so as you can imagine, the ramp throughout the quarter, really the exit rate was quite a bit higher than 25%. So, we\u2019re in a great spot going into Q3, you should expect that Q3 is going to be a much higher mix of our new starts as Omnipod 5. The other thing to remember is, I know many of you look at IQVIA data to sort of understand what new starts are, there\u2019s a component there called NRx, which is usually a really good way to take a look at new prescriptions on a product. For Omnipod 5, it\u2019s pretty high. And there\u2019s just some things to keep in mind there. One, Jim called out the percent of conversion. So we have a very large percentage of new to Omnipod 5 that are conversions from our legacy products. The other thing to remember is that, Omnipod 5 requires two prescriptions. So it requires a prescription for a starter kit and a refill of pods. And so, as you look at the IQVIA data, you\u2019re just going to want to make sure that you\u2019re only viewing one of those. And that you remember that, the majority of new to Omnipod is conversions. But we\u2019re thrilled to be in full market release, and the team is excited to just be \u2013 in full promotion mode starting Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Hey. Congrats and thanks for taking the question. Wayde, I was looking at the guidance for US Omnipod growth specifically in the US and the first half was about 26%, and the guide for the full year 23% to 26%. So it seems a little bit of a step down in the second half, but you do have the COVID comps going away and Omnipod 5 launching. So I wanted to get some color on the second half specifically. And then on the $7 million of stocking, our inventory build with Omnipod 5 this quarter. How much of that was assumed in the Q2 guidance? Thank you.\nWayde McMillan: Yeah. Hi, Travis, it\u2019s glad you asked this question, we get to provide a little more color here. So first of all, you called out the $7 million of channel inventory build, and that\u2019s something that you have to factor into the first half, second half as you\u2019re thinking about the guidance. The other thing to normalize for is, we had an incredibly strong Q4 last year, and so that creates a tough comp for us. So if you include normalization for the channel build, and think about the tough comp, the second half is actually a stronger percentage growth rate and certainly on an absolute dollar basis, a much higher than the first half. So we\u2019ve got a really strong US guide into the second half of the year. And on the channel inventory build, we don\u2019t factor in any major channel build into our guidance. You know we do factor some trends and some normal order patterns and some normal stocking. But whenever we see a large material or significant channel build or channel destock, we call them out, just like we have in the past. And so as we talked about in the prepared remarks here, we\u2019re going to continue to see Omnipod 5 inventory ramp. That will be offset by reductions of our classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH at our distributors. And depending on how that matches up or is mismatched, it could result in an inventory channel build. And so again, when we see it material, we\u2019ll factor that in and let you guys know in our prepared remarks. But from here, we typically don\u2019t build in large stocking or destocking into our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. Just on your clinical programs, what is the latest outlook for a Type 2 pivotal study? And on the clinical study you mentioned versus non-AID, are you hoping to use that for enhanced reimbursement? Have you received feedback from payers that that is possible? Thanks a lot.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Steve. On the Type 2 program, we\u2019ve launched \u2013 obviously, we have first [technical difficulty] 2 patients very successfully with Omnipod DASH, where we have an indication for use. And as we said in our prepared comments, we had roughly 30% of our new customer starts where people with Type 2 diabetes, and we continue to grow that year-over-year. So we\u2019re very confident that we have a great experience for people with Type 2 diabetes already, fantastic form factor, great pay-as-you-go model and access to the pharmacy, all of which are differentiated. But we are working on Type 2 pipeline. And as you know, we published fantastic feasibility data with Omnipod 5 for patients with Type 2. We published that earlier in the year at ATTD in Barcelona. And based on that study, we\u2019re in conversation with the FDA about the protocol for a pivotal trial. And as we get closer on that, we\u2019ll tell the market more about it. And I\u2019m going to turn to Deb to talk about the randomized controlled trial.\nDeborah Gordon: Yeah. Hi, how are you? We\u2019re excited about the randomized controlled trial. And you\u2019re right, we are doing that in order to grow our clinical body of evidence, but also it\u2019s really focused on driving access and reimbursement in our international markets. You know as you\u2019re aware, we\u2019re \u2013 we consider ourselves our own category with the tubeless AID system. And what we want to do is, chart out reimbursement specific for our offering that we know will be well received internationally, and it will help, we believe, with the strength of the data from the RCT should help us with negotiating pricing and setting reimbursement in countries where that either is not reimbursement today with AID or certainly, we want to get higher reimbursement for our offering. So, really excited about doing the study. We are in the United States and France, because they\u2019re two of our largest markets. And in fact, we actually very early on in the enrollment process, but we already have almost 50 people enrolled in seven sites in our US market, and we\u2019ll be soon enrolling our new first patients in press. So really excited. It\u2019s just one of the many levers that we are pulling in order to get ourselves ready to launch next year in our international markets with Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Wade, I want to circle back on margins. You talked about a lot of the puts and takes on gross margin, but SG&A was up meaningfully year-over-year, even if you back out some of the one-time stuff. Just curious, was there anything to call out there? And how do you think about that moving forward? And then one just detail on O 5. Are you getting a price premium there versus DASH? Some of the prescription data suggests that it might be priced a little higher. Thank you.\nWayde McMillan: Hey, Chris, I\u2019ll start it, and I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret on the questions on Omnipod 5. So regarding SG&A, you may have caught it in the prepared remarks, we talked about increasing our investment in direct-to-consumer advertising on the front end of Omnipod 5, and we certainly have a lot of investment for Omnipod 5, both here in the US as we prepared for the full market release and worked our way through the limited market release. And then internationally, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of work going across many functions, marketing, and in particular, in IT, and we\u2019ve got a significant amount of work to do country-by-country from the infrastructure that needs to be built to support our cloud infrastructure and what we have you know to bring with our Omnipod 5 system is really this differentiated system that works in the cloud and brings a lot of benefits to both the HCPs and the customers. And so we\u2019re working on that. It\u2019s different in every country outside the US. We have to be aware of the privacy laws and other things. So, a lot of investment there, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing show up in our SG&A today. And I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret on Omnipod 5.\nBret Christensen: Yeah. Hi, Chris. The pricing of Omnipod 5 versus DASH, remember, we said we would price it at parity to DASH, and we\u2019re sticking to that. So we are offering payers the exact same rebates for Omnipod 5 that we offered for DASH. The exception to that \u2013 and the reason you might see some discrepancies in pricing are mainly around mix. And remember, Omnipod 5 is a pharmacy-only product. So we did have a few payers that were in DME that we are not offering Omnipod 5 in DME and so they do have to move to the pharmacy channel. So that will cause you know a little bit of price lift, frankly, in the pharmacy channel for the average pod pricing, but per payer, there\u2019s pricing at parity with just a few exceptions.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you for taking the question and nice quarter. As you prepare for the international launch of Omnipod 5, what have you learned so far in the limited version here in the US that you can take over there? And should we think of a limited launch in the international market arena also? Thanks.\nBret Christensen: Yeah, Joanne, this is Bret. Yeah, you know most of the learnings from the US, we can translate to a European launch. And so remember, there\u2019s a lot to learn from Omnipod 5. It\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s self-service, there\u2019s different training. We\u2019ve learned a lot with training and support in coordination with Dexcom, our CGM partner. So all of those will serve us well when we launch in Europe. There\u2019s still work to do. And Jim mentioned, you know we are well on our way to CE Mark in Europe. And we\u2019ve still got work to do even after CE Mark. So, you know we are targeting middle of \u201823 for the first markets in Europe to come on board, and that will \u2013 that effort will move into \u201824, because they are going to be staggered launches. So there\u2019s work to do with the cloud. And remember, we\u2019re pioneering here. You know, we are going to be the first company that\u2019s getting real-time data on every single user. So we\u2019re putting a SIM card in PDMs. We\u2019re building a cloud that meets the requirements of every country. And then we\u2019re assessing the reimbursement environment. We\u2019ve got to establish reimbursement for an AID system that is Omnipod, and we\u2019re looking at the potential for different pricing in those markets. So, all-in-all, there\u2019s work to be done even after CE Mark, and you can expect those launches to come in a staggered fashion starting in the middle of \u201823.\nJim Hollingshead: I\u2019ll just tag on the back of that, Bret, that one thing to bear in mind is, you know as we launch Omnipod 5 and we go market-by-market, with all of that work we\u2019re doing to pioneer the cloud-based offerings, we\u2019re also digging a huge moat. We\u2019re going to do it sequentially. We\u2019re going to do it right and we\u2019re going to do it to win. It will be very difficult for anybody to follow.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCecilia Furlong: Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could just provide a bit more color just in terms of takeaways from your limited distribution period, what was incorporated or adjustments that you made as you transition to full market launch? And then kind of on the heels of that, too, just your free trial period with Omnipod 5, that really the rationale shifting from 30-days to 10-days? And thank you for taking the question.\nBret Christensen: Yeah, Cecilia, this is Bret. So you know the list is long of what we learned in the LMR. And you know we\u2019re thrilled again to be moving to full market release. But we commented on some of what we\u2019ve learned. A lot has to do with the onboarding experience. We adjusted the trading protocols, some of the self-service options, some of the expectation setting for those that might be coming from an AID system versus MDI, there\u2019s a lot to learn there, and we got really comfortable with that, which is why we\u2019re moving to full market release.\nJim Hollingshead: And the second part was, I think are on the free trials.\nBret Christensen: The free trials. Certainly, yes. So, the 10-days is a great question, because we are committed to free trial with Omnipod 5, and you know it was a 30-day free trial with DASH. And while we wanted to do that same trial with Omnipod 5, Omnipod 5 is a system that includes the Dexcom, CGM. So, that was really in coordination with our partner there and Dexcom, as they offer a free 10-day trial, we want to make sure that we\u2019re not offering a trial that doesn\u2019t include a CGM. So a lot of work there and a lot of coordination that went into that, but we\u2019re committed to doing free trials for Omnipod 5, and it\u2019s something you will see us continue to offer.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the inventory build and kind of what that means for domestic patient adds. Just as I was playing with our model quickly, you know even if you take out that $7 million, it still seems like those domestic patient adds grew at a faster clip than expected. So you know can you give us any sense of whether new patient adds domestically, for example, grew faster than overall domestic revenue growth or you know that\u2019s too strong to say? And then you know on the inventory side, were you able to talk to distributors in terms of why they wanted to build up so much demand? You know is it because they\u2019re seeing it, if you\u2019re around lack of supply? Or they\u2019re hearing from patients already that they need to be ready? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. Hey, Margaret, it\u2019s Wayde. Why don\u2019t I start with the inventory and maybe a little on the new product adds, I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret, because he\u2019s got the insights from the team. So on the inventory build, you know some of this is just timing and the way it happened you know as we shifted from limited market release into full market release. And you know limited market release, as you recall, we stepped into it by adding in mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, but held back on the large you know bolus of retail pharmacies. And when we then move to the retail pharmacies, that\u2019s when we had significant inventory to move into the channel so that those wholesalers and distributors can feed as Jim said in his prepared remarks, the 88,000 retail pharmacies across the country. And so that\u2019s just timing. And we\u2019ll continue to build inventory with Omnipod 5, and it just depends on the end of the quarter where we\u2019re at with the reductions on the DASH and classic, if we have more inventory builds in the future. But you\u2019re right, it does speak to the excitement out there and the demand that\u2019s building out there, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to get as much channel inventory out there as soon as we can now, because of the access as Jim mentioned as well in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re well ahead on access. That was one of the other major metrics that we were managing in order to go to full market release. And now that we\u2019re over 50% access out there, there are many people that can get prescriptions and now get Omnipod 5. So it\u2019s pretty exciting to see the inventory stocking in the channel and all the pharmacies across the country that people be able to access the product in. And from a domestic adds standpoint, you\u2019re right, that is one of the reasons that we exceeded the high end of our guidance this quarter. We don\u2019t get a significant amount of revenue from new customer starts in any particular quarter, just because of the annuity-based model that we\u2019re in that I know you\u2019re familiar with. But, Bret, any color you want to add on the domestic adds?\nBret Christensen: Yeah. Margaret, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 you know this inventory build is almost something that\u2019s just unavoidable with a product launch like Omnipod 5. I mean, ideally, you\u2019d love to see the DASH inventory drop at the same rate that Omnipod 5 is going up. But look, we try to project this as well as we can and communicate with our distributors. And I think it\u2019s fair to say demand just exceeded our expectations here, you know especially with conversions. So the one thing we have to point to was when we launched DASH, we did see conversions from our legacy product, but demand for Omnipod 5 is just much different. And we have podders who have been waiting for Omnipod 5 for a long time. And that is \u2013 you know we just saw a lot more conversions, a lot more demand, and that resulted in a little bit of inventory build. But again, it\u2019s healthy, and we try to keep it to a minimum.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. Jim, you\u2019ve said \u2013 I embark for yourself with the quarter here, at least in the US. I wanted to ask on the international, it was down quarter-on-quarter, the model typically doesn\u2019t lend itself to sequential declines. And I realized FX was probably a bit of a factor here. But why was 2Q international revenue down quarter-on-quarter? And it looks like the implied 3Q was kind of flat to down slightly as well? So a little detail there. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure, Jayson, it\u2019s Wayde. I can take that one. And this is what we\u2019ve seen historically as well. So we do get this question from time to time. It\u2019s typically when we see that sequential down. And it\u2019s certainly an understandable question, because it\u2019s an annuity model. But what we see happening across our international business, and this is the case in prior years as well. Because we sell a lot of our revenue through the distribution channel, we have ebbs and flows in the distributor inventory patterns and order patterns and depends at the end and beginning of quarters where we\u2019re at and fulfilling those orders. So, it lends itself to be a little bit more difficult to understand, because it is an annuity model. But that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve also seen us call out internationally, whenever we\u2019ve had stocking or destocking of a material nature, you\u2019ve seen us call that out as well. So when we don\u2019t, and we see a couple of million dollar swings between the quarters, it\u2019s really just an order trend and nothing that we\u2019re concerned about or I think we should be calling out as well. And as we move into the second half of the year, you\u2019re right, Q3 goes up, but we typically see a seasonal decline in Q4 as well. And that\u2019s some of the distributors, I think, managing their inventory at the calendar year end. And so, really nothing to talk about here, Jayson, other than just some normal inventory trends. And you know again, we\u2019ll call it out when we see anything material.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show next question comes from the line of Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBrian Kennedy: This is Brian for Josh. Thank you for taking my question. On the cost of therapy, a competitor cited patients delaying pump purchases, specifically because of the upfront cost. How big of a factor do you judge cost to be as a driver for Omnipod 5 adoption? And do you have an ability to or, I guess, an interest in lowering current co-pays further should pump manufacturers introduce payment plans that match the typical co-pay?\nBret Christensen: Hi, Josh, it\u2019s Bret, Brian, sorry. We think cost is very important. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why years ago, we decided to move to the pharmacy channel, more importantly, move to a pay-as-you-go model, because it is \u2013 the upfront fee is very disruptive and very difficult for patients, especially if they have not met their deductibles. So you know for us, we don\u2019t see these type of headwinds and these fluctuations, because the co-pays in the pharmacy are predictable and they\u2019re low. And remember, the majority \u2013 the vast majority of our patients pay something less than $50. So the average is much lower than that. And as Jim said, many pay zero. So you know the pay-as-you-go model is really important. We topped that off with free trial, you know and you can try Omnipod for free, if you want to. And then, I think the final part of your question is about lowering co-pays, and that\u2019s just an effort we\u2019re always making. And we talk about that as functional access. So we want to do a few things. We want to remove prior offs. We want to remove high co-pays. And in some cases, we\u2019re willing to give up a little bit on the rebate percentage with payers if we can get that accomplished, because we want to remove every obstacle we can to get it on Omnipod.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Hey, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, Wayde, I think you kind of started talking about this. But if you adjust for that inventory build in Q2, you know you grew on a stack two-year basis you know low 20% you know in Q2, low 20% in Q1. Now you\u2019re expecting this big bump in Q3, Q4, kind of the more of the mid-20s on a two-year stack basis. So, where is that growth specifically expected to come from? Is it an acceleration in the Type 1 patient population? Is it more conversion from existing pump users? I mean, where is that really coming from here in the US? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Yeah, Matt. I\u2019m not sure I quite followed all that math. But I think if I followed you right, what you\u2019re saying is you know first half, you know strong growth rates. And if you do normalize for that $7 million channel inventory build, we have about a 26% growth rate in the US in Q2. And so, then you take that and you look at the second half guide, where, as you said, we\u2019re in the mid-20s, and that\u2019s a strong guide for us, especially given that tough competitive comp we have in Q4 of last year was such a strong quarter. And then, where is the growth going to come from? It\u2019s all the above, Matt. It\u2019s pretty exciting. As you know, all of the drivers that we\u2019ve had in the business before Omnipod 5 are really what are continuing to drive the business here. The pay-as-you-go model, the DASH product itself, all the economic benefits that Bret just mentioned. And so, as well as the differentiated opportunity we have in Type 2 in the pharmacy channel. So, a lot of drivers, and that is going to be what continues to drive the business. And then Omnipod 5 at 25% of the new customer starts here in Q2 will continue to be a driver as that continues to ramp. So, you know we\u2019ve got a lot of growth momentum in the US, and I think the guidance reflects that.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Dane Reinhardt from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. This is actually Jeff on for Dane. I apologize on having some phone issues today. But two questions, I guess. One, Wayde, just clarifying, we keep talking about the $7 million stocking tailwind in the second quarter. I thought you said some of that was netted out between old Omnipod 5 inventory coming out. Should we be thinking about that as a one-timer of $7 million? Or is it a little less than that? And then, Jim, just wanted to ask you, you know this is your first full quarter now as CEO or first quarter as CEO, spending is going way up. Is this conceptually how we should think about you, you\u2019re a revenue guy, you\u2019re going to drive revenue and cost be damned or at least cost don\u2019t matter in the near-term, we are going to push the top line in the competitive mode as much as possible. Just trying to understand your style here, maybe. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. Hey, Jeff, I was a little disappointed actually if you weren\u2019t going to be on. So it was great to hear your voice. And I\u2019ll just answer the first part really quickly. The $7 million is net. So that is the net impact of Omnipod 5 inventory ramping and classic Omnipod and DASH coming down.\nJim Hollingshead: Jeff, thanks for your question. And I actually love your question. And it\u2019s \u2013 by the way, it\u2019s great to be here on my first quarter, and I\u2019m loving this, and we have a great team and a great strategy, and we have incredibly talented people and so much passion. But an answer to your question, I don\u2019t think you should think of me as somebody who\u2019s going to you know, cost be damned. We have massive growth opportunities in front of us. You know our investment thesis remains the same, which is, we\u2019re going to drive Omnipod 5. We\u2019re going to drive successful launch and successful growth with Omnipod 5. We\u2019re going to continue to drive international growth with DASH. We\u2019re going to continue to drive Type 2 growth with DASH. And we\u2019re going to fund all of our great innovations that are coming to market, but we\u2019re going to be very prudent with cost and how we do that. You know, we\u2019re obviously in a macro environment that presents a lot of challenges. We are not immune to that. You know that\u2019s happening across industries, it\u2019s happening in our industry. So we\u2019re going to be very prudent with costs and we\u2019re very mindful of that. But we have fantastic growth in front of us, and we\u2019re going to capture it.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jim Hollingshead, President and CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Dilem, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We\u2019ve made terrific progress in the second quarter, and we\u2019re on track for another successful year, despite having to navigate through the challenging macro environment. The full market release of Omnipod 5 is an exciting milestone, and we\u2019re really thrilled to be in full market release with that offering. And our goal is to drive that growth and to finish the year strong and sustain our growth for the long-term. I\u2019ve been really inspired \u2013 just on a personal note, I\u2019ve been truly inspired in my first two months here as CEO. We\u2019re making great progress. We are changing people\u2019s lives. We\u2019ve got great and talented people. We have one of the best management teams in MedTech, and we\u2019ve got phenomenal offerings. Insulet has never been in a better position to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people at diabetes. Thanks, everyone, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as CEO of Insulet. This past quarter, we exceeded our revenue expectations resulting from sustained momentum across our business. We are halfway through the year and the entire Insulet team is executing at a high level. We increased our full year outlook for US Omnipod, delivered record US and global new customer starts, had our second highest new customer starts quarter internationally and meaningfully advanced each of our strategic imperatives. Accomplishing this was no easy task, given the challenging global macro environment that we and other companies are facing. We are incredibly excited to have recently entered full market release for Omnipod 5. And now our differentiated transformative technology is available broadly through retail pharmacies. The results to-date have been amazing. Omnipod 5 is proving to be the game changer we thought it would be. Customer and healthcare provider feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and our teams are doing a remarkable job executing the launch. Our CE Mark submission review is progressing very well, and we are in the final stretch toward approval. This represents a key milestone in our plan to bring Omnipod 5 to people with diabetes around the world. This approval is one step in our strategy to participate in the international AID market, which is being driven largely by CGM reimbursement. We have also advanced our clinical efforts. Our FDA submission for an expanded indication for Omnipod 5 in the US down to age two is progressing very well, and we are confident in the near-term clearance. The value that Omnipod 5 can deliver to young children and their families is abundantly clear, and we're thrilled to soon bring Omnipod 5 to this highly vulnerable population. We shared compelling data at ADA, demonstrating how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for the Type 2 insulin requirement population, a market segment that is further adopting Omnipod due to our unique value proposition. And in the Type 1 population, we are currently enrolling for a 200-patient 3-months randomized controlled trial in France and the US to demonstrate superior efficacy for Omnipod 5 compared to non-AID pumps and CGM alone. Lastly, we broke ground at our future Malaysian manufacturing facility, which will strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities and redundancy, as well as support our international expansion strategy. Before moving into a broader view of the quarter on our progress, I want to take a step back and reflect on my first two months as CEO. I was aware of the strength and commitment of the entire Insulet team from my three years on the Board of Directors. Now that I'm CEO, I'm even more impressed. Our global teams are exceptional. The shared commitment to our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes is inspiring and is pervasive throughout our organization. Diabetes is a growing global epidemic and Insulet's ability to serve unmet needs and provide improved outcomes has never been more important. It is clear that we have the team, the product portfolio, the innovation roadmap, and most importantly, the passion to improve millions of lives, and I'm excited and privileged to lead Insulet on that journey. Expanding access and awareness are keys to driving our business forward. Despite improvements over the last few years, only a small percentage of people with Type 1 diabetes globally benefit from insulin delivery technology. Access and awareness are important levers that will significantly drive increased penetration over the coming years. We are making terrific progress building awareness and securing coverage globally, including broad coverage for Omnipod 5 in the US. We've built a unique leadership position in the US pharmacy channel, which improves functional access for both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations. The vast majority of our US customers continue to pay less than $50 each month through the pharmacy for Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5, with many paid nothing. We've eliminated lengthy lock-in periods and upfront costs that are common in the DME channel, and our pay-as-you-go model provides easier and more affordable access for our customers and removes risk for payers. And we are delivering this easier access, combined with lower costs, while also delivering an improved customer experience and better outcomes. That's a winning combination and one that resonates with people using multiple daily injections, a population from which we continue to capture approximately 80% of our new customers. Our pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business models also connect with people with Type 2 diabetes. We are acutely focused on making access simple and more affordable, providing an unmatched form factor and generating clinical evidence that supports what Omnipod can do for the Type 2 population. Because the Omnipod offering is so compelling, during the second quarter, Type 2 users represented almost 30% of our US new customer starts. As expected, this is a percentage reduction from prior quarters, because Omnipod 5 is indicated for use with people with Type 1 diabetes, as is the case with all AID systems. Therefore, we expect the mix percentage of new customers to change as more people with Type 1 adopt Omnipod 5. We saw this begin in Q2 and we're excited to see it continue now that we are in full market release. Nevertheless, we continue to see a strong number of new customers with Type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH, and we remain confident in our ability to further penetrate this underserved population. A major component of our awareness efforts is our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. We ramped our DTC program ahead of the full market release of Omnipod 5 and have since accelerated our spend. This has resulted in more people wanting to learn about Omnipod 5 and the impact it can have on their lives and those they care about. We expect our DTC efforts for Omnipod 5 will be even more effective than what we have experienced for Omnipod DASH. We are also using DTC to drive awareness for Omnipod in select international markets. Customers love Omnipod 5. That's because of the number of firsts it brings to the market. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone controlled AID system, the first system no one has to plug in to access data and the first with a smart bolus calculator to directly incorporate trends. We've heard humbling and inspiring stories from countless customers and we're just getting started. I want to share a couple of stories we've heard from individuals adopting Omnipod 5 and how impactful it's been for their lives. An individual who had been using an insulin pump for over a decade and recently switched to Omnipod 5, told us that after 10 years of worrying about visible tubes, getting caught on door knobs and dealing with the nuisances of being tethered to his pump. He now spends more time focusing on life. His outcomes have improved, including his overnight blood sugar, and he no longer has to live his life with diabetes top of mind. We also heard from a physician who has lived with Type 1 diabetes for 43 years. He noted that during that time, he's seen treatment options evolve and change, but Omnipod 5 is the largest leap in improvement he has ever seen. This very experienced physician called our system \"remarkable\". These two stories are just a small representation of the amazing testimonials we continue to receive from Omnipod 5 users. There's a common thread that connects all the stories we hear from users. Omnipod 5 is redefining how people manage their disease and it's making their lives simpler. The impact Omnipod 5 is having is clear and it's powerful. In Q2, the first full quarter of limited market release, Omnipod 5 already represented over 25% of our US new customer starts. We expect that percentage to accelerate with the US full market release as we now sell through a broader distribution channel, including all of our wholesalers that supply products to approximately 88,000 retail pharmacies. We are also having outstanding success securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Today, we have over 55% covered lives for Omnipod 5, which is well ahead of where we were when launching Omnipod DASH, and represents a significant increase from Q1. Our team has done an amazing job, and we expect to make meaningful progress the rest of this year and into the next. Omnipod 5 is now fully available through retail, specialty and mail order pharmacies to anyone with a prescription and coverage in line with our expected timing. Our limited market release provided key learnings about how healthcare professionals and customers interact with our product on board and virtually trained, all of which are dramatically easier than ever before. Already, the small improvements we have implemented are resonating with users, especially those coming from a tubed pump who transition to a more simplified experience. In fact, one of the key learnings is that, physicians and patients can rely on the automation of the system to do the work for them during the first few days. Omnipod 5 works with the first pod out of the box and then it learns and adapts to personalized care for each individual user, typically within the first or second pod change. This ability to automatically personalize therapy clearly differentiates Omnipod 5 from all other systems on the market. Quite simply, Omnipod 5 eliminates significant burden and shared work between patients and their physicians. Although our target market continues to be MDI, not surprisingly, many of our Omnipod 5 new customers come from competitive pumps and people are loving the experience. The clinical benefits from Omnipod 5 were clearly demonstrated by the Preschool Pivotal Extension Data we shared at ADA that built on the strong results we saw during the study's initial phase, which were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Diabetes Care. During the first three-month phase of the study as well as through the end of the extension phase, patients achieved an average A1c of 6.9% compared to 7.4% at baseline. The data clearly demonstrated these individuals maintained their improved levels through the extension phase. Time in range and percent time in hypoglycemia also showed sustained improvements during the extension phase, demonstrating the durability and power of Omnipod 5 for this critical population. We look forward to receiving our preschool indication for Omnipod 5 this year. The engagement around Omnipod 5 at ADA was really something to see. We met with hundreds of attendees at our booth and held a product theater that was standing room only. It was here where we shared patient case studies and the real-world experience of HCPs who have had remarkable success with Omnipod 5. The overwhelming feedback was that Omnipod 5 clearly stood out as the most robust AID offering. And many of the MDI and tubed pump users in attendance have since adopted our technology. Overall, ADA marked another opportunity to highlight our products and clinical accomplishments that demonstrate how Omnipod can change the lives of people with diabetes around the globe and how important and meaningful our mission is. We are also advancing our innovation pipeline. We're developing the next generations of Omnipod 5, furthering our iOS development and working closely with our CGM partners, Dexcom and Abbott. Our innovation priorities are focused on growing our addressable market, building our next-generation AID technology, and creating digital and data-driven products to make diabetes management easier for our customers and their physicians. Moving on to our international operations. Our Omnipod 5 CE Mark submission is moving swiftly through review, and we expect approval over the next couple of months. This is an important milestone for our international business as we work to bring Omnipod 5 to people around the world. CE Mark clears the way for us to focus on completing a cloud-based infrastructure that is compatible with local data protection regulations, developing country-specific launch plans, channel and customer experience approaches and seeking reimbursement. Omnipod 5 is a transformative platform, and we look forward to entering our first international markets in mid-2023. We will take a staged approach to entering markets so we can ensure successful launches in each country in which we operate. In addition to bringing Omnipod 5 to global markets, we continue working to enter new markets and recently launched Omnipod DASH in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Omnipod is now available in 24 countries, and we're building local teams and advancing our regulatory and reimbursement goals. These efforts will serve us well as we bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and strengthen our competitive position. Lastly, the global supply chain and inflation, each presents significant challenges to Insulet as they do for most manufacturers across a range of industries. However, we continue to navigate these headwinds and increase our resiliency, ensuring ample product supply, including supporting the Omnipod 5 launch and the needs of our growing global customer base. We are mitigating supply risks by securing components well ahead of our capacity needs. While this comes at an increased cost that will have a near-term impact on margins, we are taking the appropriate steps in these turbulent times to ensure uninterrupted supply for our current and future customers. The footprint of our global manufacturing operations is one of our many competitive advantages, and we advanced our efforts to further strengthen our capabilities. We recently broke ground at a new manufacturing location in Malaysia, the future facility located in Johor Bahru represents an investment of approximately $200 million over the next five years, will provide approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and house more than 500 full-time employees at capacity. Our regional sourcing strategy includes the use of local suppliers for components and we have already outlined our plans to utilize environmentally responsible and resource-efficient materials in our building design. We expect to begin production at this new facility by the end of 2024. This facility supports our operational strategy to increase our global manufacturing redundancy, build our global talent base and support future international market expansion efforts. In closing, the second quarter marked a number of financial, commercial and operational milestones. Our entire Insulet team continues to execute with an unwavering commitment to our mission and to our customers. We are proud of all the work and accomplishments we achieved this quarter, and now we are setting the stage for sustainable long-term growth. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the congratulations, too. I think it's a little bit early to say about how the rates are going to settle out. We're very happy with adoption of Omnipod 5 across the board. As we said, you know more than 80% of our new customer starts are patients coming from MDI, and so \u2013 you know that's our target market. We are seeing a high percentage of patients converting from Omnipod DASH. And you know to me, that's a great sign of demand, because what it shows is that, patients who are already on the Omnipod experience, we know they've been waiting for Omnipod 5. And so we're actually, I think, getting a somewhat higher percentage of conversions already. And if you remember, during limited market release, what we've been telling the market is the fastest way to get an Omnipod 5 is to get an Omnipod DASH and then convert. So we're seeing that very well. And we are seeing conversions from other tubed pump offerings. And so we're getting a mix across the board, and we're really happy with that. Thanks, Steve. On the Type 2 program, we've launched \u2013 obviously, we have first [technical difficulty] 2 patients very successfully with Omnipod DASH, where we have an indication for use. And as we said in our prepared comments, we had roughly 30% of our new customer starts where people with Type 2 diabetes, and we continue to grow that year-over-year. So we're very confident that we have a great experience for people with Type 2 diabetes already, fantastic form factor, great pay-as-you-go model and access to the pharmacy, all of which are differentiated. But we are working on Type 2 pipeline. And as you know, we published fantastic feasibility data with Omnipod 5 for patients with Type 2. We published that earlier in the year at ATTD in Barcelona. And based on that study, we're in conversation with the FDA about the protocol for a pivotal trial. And as we get closer on that, we'll tell the market more about it. And I'm going to turn to Deb to talk about the randomized controlled trial. I'll just tag on the back of that, Bret, that one thing to bear in mind is, you know as we launch Omnipod 5 and we go market-by-market, with all of that work we're doing to pioneer the cloud-based offerings, we're also digging a huge moat. We're going to do it sequentially. We're going to do it right and we're going to do it to win. It will be very difficult for anybody to follow. And the second part was, I think are on the free trials. Jeff, thanks for your question. And I actually love your question. And it's \u2013 by the way, it's great to be here on my first quarter, and I'm loving this, and we have a great team and a great strategy, and we have incredibly talented people and so much passion. But an answer to your question, I don't think you should think of me as somebody who's going to you know, cost be damned. We have massive growth opportunities in front of us. You know our investment thesis remains the same, which is, we're going to drive Omnipod 5. We're going to drive successful launch and successful growth with Omnipod 5. We're going to continue to drive international growth with DASH. We're going to continue to drive Type 2 growth with DASH. And we're going to fund all of our great innovations that are coming to market, but we're going to be very prudent with cost and how we do that. You know, we're obviously in a macro environment that presents a lot of challenges. We are not immune to that. You know that's happening across industries, it's happening in our industry. So we're going to be very prudent with costs and we're very mindful of that. But we have fantastic growth in front of us, and we're going to capture it. Thanks, Dilem, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We've made terrific progress in the second quarter, and we're on track for another successful year, despite having to navigate through the challenging macro environment. The full market release of Omnipod 5 is an exciting milestone, and we're really thrilled to be in full market release with that offering. And our goal is to drive that growth and to finish the year strong and sustain our growth for the long-term. I've been really inspired \u2013 just on a personal note, I've been truly inspired in my first two months here as CEO. We're making great progress. We are changing people's lives. We've got great and talented people. We have one of the best management teams in MedTech, and we've got phenomenal offerings. Insulet has never been in a better position to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people at diabetes. Thanks, everyone, and have a great day."

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. We've made great progress in Q2 as we delivered another quarter of record US and global new customer starts and achieved a number of notable milestones, including the US full commercial launch of Omnipod 5 within the time range we expected. We are advancing each of our strategic imperatives, navigating supply chain and inflation challenges and maintaining our focus on fulfilling our mission. We generated 18% revenue growth in the second quarter, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 390 basis point headwind compared to Q2 of last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 31%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the US pharmacy channel, including initial contributions from Omnipod 5. Q2 revenue included an estimated $7 million of net channel inventory build, which consisted of Omnipod 5 inventory build, partially offset by a reduction of classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH inventory at our distributors. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 of the prior year included a favorable comparison for an approximate $2 million catch-up in rebates from earlier periods. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined, were up sequentially to over 90% of our total US new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod DASH at approximately 65% and Omnipod 5, over 25%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 65% of our total US volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9% at the low end of our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition headwinds and the pandemic's compounding impact over the past year. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,130 basis point headwind over prior year. During Q2, both our estimated global attrition and pod utilization remain consistent. Drug Delivery revenue declined 36%, in line with our guidance range. Gross margin was 63.6%, representing a 580 basis point decrease or 640 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we ramp our US manufacturing operations, a higher warranty accrual for costs related to Omnipod DASH PDMs for battery lives as they age, as well as higher costs given the mix impact of Omnipod 5 ramping, all partially offset by growing volume through the US pharmacy channel. As a reminder, the higher mix of volume at our US manufacturing facility, growing Omnipod 5 volume and the higher component costs included in our inventory balance will continue to pressure gross margin for the remainder of this year as we sell the product out of inventory. Operating expenses were above our expectations due to $27.3 million of legal costs as well as $3.4 million of costs associated with the Retirement and Advisory Services of the former CEO. Excluding these charges, operating expenses were higher than Q2 of last year, due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, international expansion, continued investments in innovation and scaling our global business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q2, which exclude the legal and CEO transition costs, were 1.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Both were impacted by the gross margin pressures and increase in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency. Turning to cash and liquidity. During the quarter, we secured an additional $10 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Overall, our financial position is strong and provides flexibility to invest across our business to fuel sustainable long-term growth. Now, turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising full year revenue to a range of 14% to 17%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 23% to 26%. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased Omnipod DASH volume through the pharmacy channel, the benefit of our pay-as-you-go model, which should expand both our Type 1 and Type 2 customer base, and increasing volume for Omnipod 5, following our full market release. As a reminder, significant revenue from the Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are reducing our full year revenue guidance to 9% to 12%, related to the impact of AID competition in our international markets. Revenue growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, which is sold in all of our markets. We expect international revenue growth will be the highest in the fourth quarter of the year \u2013 due to an easier comparison as well as an expected improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, for our drug delivery revenue range, we are lowering full year guidance to a decline of 35% to 40%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. We now expect a range of 65% to 66%, representing a decline of 200 basis points from our previous expectation as we continue to encounter higher costs associated with ramping US manufacturing and Omnipod 5 volumes, higher warranty costs, and the ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures in the broader macro environment. We continue to execute strategies to partially offset these headwinds, while also ensuring we have more than enough capacity to meet expected demand. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin will be impacted by product line mix from lower drug delivery revenue, higher costs associated with our US manufacturing ramp, product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5, manufacturing components due to inflation and warranty costs. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the US pharmacy channel. We expect unfavorable product mix, the US manufacturing ramp, as well as inflation and supply chain macro-related headwinds to continue to impact our results for the next couple of years. We expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year, driven by ongoing investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5, and increasing DTC advertising, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. Excluding the legal and CEO transition costs, we now expect operating margin to be in the high single-digits as a result of the gross margin reduction and the macro environment creating inflationary and foreign exchange pressures. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase slightly due to ongoing investments in key areas of our business. Turning to our third quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 17% to 20%, including Omnipod growth of 18% to 21%. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate the impact will be approximately 500 basis points on a reported basis for total revenue. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 24% to 27%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model, growing Omnipod DASH volume through the US pharmacy channel and ramping contributions from Omnipod 5. We expect Q3 international Omnipod growth of 7% to 10%, driven by the ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by competitive AID headwinds and the compounding impact on new customer starts in 2021 and into 2022, largely due to the pandemic. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,300 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to decline 14% to 5% as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic levels. In conclusion, we've achieved a number of critical milestones that further position Insulet for growth. While there continues to be macro-related challenges, these are exciting times with the full market release of Omnipod 5, now fully available through retail pharmacies, and soon, CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 internationally. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer growth, while also investing in key areas throughout our global business, in order to drive future growth and sustain long-term value creation. With that, Dilem, please open the call for questions. Hi, Larry. So for our margins, as you mentioned, we stepped them down this quarter for both some micro and macro issues. You know I think as has been well publicized across many companies, the macro environment is tough, both from an inflationary and foreign exchange, and we've felt that as well. We also have a couple of things that impacted us in the quarter. You saw us talk about our warranty increase on our PDMs as well as some of the volume that we're increasing in our Acton facility. And then just a highlight for folks. You saw us take down our gross margin guidance for drug delivery. That's a higher margin product line. And so when we reduce revenue guidance there, that's a headwind for us. And then we've increased our volume for Omnipod 5. Our expectations for Omnipod 5 are growing even above what we originally thought. And cost of goods sold are slightly higher for Omnipod 5 as well. So, although that's a good thing that we're growing volumes with Omnipod 5, it is a headwind to our cost of goods sold. So that creates about a 2% impact to gross margins, and that really is what drops through to operating margins. We also have other inflationary headwinds throughout operating expenses, given the wage environment as well as services and other increased costs out there that most companies are dealing with. So that's the reason that we changed our guidance. It's a little too early to tell what expectations will be beyond 2022, we have to monitor closely the macro environment here. What we do know is that, we are paying higher cost for inputs, raw materials and components to build capacity. And you can see it in our inventory as we continue to grow inventory, our operations teams are doing a great job of identifying capacity and growing inventory in this environment, but it is coming at a higher cost. And with the inventory that we've built, a lot of that is deferred over a six-month period of time. And so that's already starting to impact what our gross margins will be next year. So, although we're very happy to be building inventory and developing extra capacity, it does come at a higher cost. And so that's going to impact us for some time. But we're not going to look out beyond that at this point, Larry. I think we've got to monitor the macro environment and see what it looks like. What we are going to commit to is that over time, we will continue to expand gross margins and operating margins, that's a key focus for us. It may not be in any particular year, especially with the macro headwinds that we're dealing with today. But you can count on us to continue to expand margins over time. Yeah. Hi, Travis, it's glad you asked this question, we get to provide a little more color here. So first of all, you called out the $7 million of channel inventory build, and that's something that you have to factor into the first half, second half as you're thinking about the guidance. The other thing to normalize for is, we had an incredibly strong Q4 last year, and so that creates a tough comp for us. So if you include normalization for the channel build, and think about the tough comp, the second half is actually a stronger percentage growth rate and certainly on an absolute dollar basis, a much higher than the first half. So we've got a really strong US guide into the second half of the year. And on the channel inventory build, we don't factor in any major channel build into our guidance. You know we do factor some trends and some normal order patterns and some normal stocking. But whenever we see a large material or significant channel build or channel destock, we call them out, just like we have in the past. And so as we talked about in the prepared remarks here, we're going to continue to see Omnipod 5 inventory ramp. That will be offset by reductions of our classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH at our distributors. And depending on how that matches up or is mismatched, it could result in an inventory channel build. And so again, when we see it material, we'll factor that in and let you guys know in our prepared remarks. But from here, we typically don't build in large stocking or destocking into our guidance. Hey, Chris, I'll start it, and I'll pass it over to Bret on the questions on Omnipod 5. So regarding SG&A, you may have caught it in the prepared remarks, we talked about increasing our investment in direct-to-consumer advertising on the front end of Omnipod 5, and we certainly have a lot of investment for Omnipod 5, both here in the US as we prepared for the full market release and worked our way through the limited market release. And then internationally, we've got a significant amount of work going across many functions, marketing, and in particular, in IT, and we've got a significant amount of work to do country-by-country from the infrastructure that needs to be built to support our cloud infrastructure and what we have you know to bring with our Omnipod 5 system is really this differentiated system that works in the cloud and brings a lot of benefits to both the HCPs and the customers. And so we're working on that. It's different in every country outside the US. We have to be aware of the privacy laws and other things. So, a lot of investment there, and that's what you're seeing show up in our SG&A today. And I'll pass it over to Bret on Omnipod 5. Sure. Hey, Margaret, it's Wayde. Why don't I start with the inventory and maybe a little on the new product adds, I'll pass it over to Bret, because he's got the insights from the team. So on the inventory build, you know some of this is just timing and the way it happened you know as we shifted from limited market release into full market release. And you know limited market release, as you recall, we stepped into it by adding in mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, but held back on the large you know bolus of retail pharmacies. And when we then move to the retail pharmacies, that's when we had significant inventory to move into the channel so that those wholesalers and distributors can feed as Jim said in his prepared remarks, the 88,000 retail pharmacies across the country. And so that's just timing. And we'll continue to build inventory with Omnipod 5, and it just depends on the end of the quarter where we're at with the reductions on the DASH and classic, if we have more inventory builds in the future. But you're right, it does speak to the excitement out there and the demand that's building out there, and that's why we're trying to get as much channel inventory out there as soon as we can now, because of the access as Jim mentioned as well in his prepared remarks, we're well ahead on access. That was one of the other major metrics that we were managing in order to go to full market release. And now that we're over 50% access out there, there are many people that can get prescriptions and now get Omnipod 5. So it's pretty exciting to see the inventory stocking in the channel and all the pharmacies across the country that people be able to access the product in. And from a domestic adds standpoint, you're right, that is one of the reasons that we exceeded the high end of our guidance this quarter. We don't get a significant amount of revenue from new customer starts in any particular quarter, just because of the annuity-based model that we're in that I know you're familiar with. But, Bret, any color you want to add on the domestic adds? Sure, Jayson, it's Wayde. I can take that one. And this is what we've seen historically as well. So we do get this question from time to time. It's typically when we see that sequential down. And it's certainly an understandable question, because it's an annuity model. But what we see happening across our international business, and this is the case in prior years as well. Because we sell a lot of our revenue through the distribution channel, we have ebbs and flows in the distributor inventory patterns and order patterns and depends at the end and beginning of quarters where we're at and fulfilling those orders. So, it lends itself to be a little bit more difficult to understand, because it is an annuity model. But that's it. You've also seen us call out internationally, whenever we've had stocking or destocking of a material nature, you've seen us call that out as well. So when we don't, and we see a couple of million dollar swings between the quarters, it's really just an order trend and nothing that we're concerned about or I think we should be calling out as well. And as we move into the second half of the year, you're right, Q3 goes up, but we typically see a seasonal decline in Q4 as well. And that's some of the distributors, I think, managing their inventory at the calendar year end. And so, really nothing to talk about here, Jayson, other than just some normal inventory trends. And you know again, we'll call it out when we see anything material. Yeah, Matt. I'm not sure I quite followed all that math. But I think if I followed you right, what you're saying is you know first half, you know strong growth rates. And if you do normalize for that $7 million channel inventory build, we have about a 26% growth rate in the US in Q2. And so, then you take that and you look at the second half guide, where, as you said, we're in the mid-20s, and that's a strong guide for us, especially given that tough competitive comp we have in Q4 of last year was such a strong quarter. And then, where is the growth going to come from? It's all the above, Matt. It's pretty exciting. As you know, all of the drivers that we've had in the business before Omnipod 5 are really what are continuing to drive the business here. The pay-as-you-go model, the DASH product itself, all the economic benefits that Bret just mentioned. And so, as well as the differentiated opportunity we have in Type 2 in the pharmacy channel. So, a lot of drivers, and that is going to be what continues to drive the business. And then Omnipod 5 at 25% of the new customer starts here in Q2 will continue to be a driver as that continues to ramp. So, you know we've got a lot of growth momentum in the US, and I think the guidance reflects that. Sure. Hey, Jeff, I was a little disappointed actually if you weren't going to be on. So it was great to hear your voice. And I'll just answer the first part really quickly. The $7 million is net. So that is the net impact of Omnipod 5 inventory ramping and classic Omnipod and DASH coming down."

            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "Hey, Robbie, it's Bret. Just to draft in here a little bit. You asked about the exit rate. So yeah, good pickup there. 25% was our mix for the entire quarter. So remember, we just entered a full market release. And so as you can imagine, the ramp throughout the quarter, really the exit rate was quite a bit higher than 25%. So, we're in a great spot going into Q3, you should expect that Q3 is going to be a much higher mix of our new starts as Omnipod 5. The other thing to remember is, I know many of you look at IQVIA data to sort of understand what new starts are, there's a component there called NRx, which is usually a really good way to take a look at new prescriptions on a product. For Omnipod 5, it's pretty high. And there's just some things to keep in mind there. One, Jim called out the percent of conversion. So we have a very large percentage of new to Omnipod 5 that are conversions from our legacy products. The other thing to remember is that, Omnipod 5 requires two prescriptions. So it requires a prescription for a starter kit and a refill of pods. And so, as you look at the IQVIA data, you're just going to want to make sure that you're only viewing one of those. And that you remember that, the majority of new to Omnipod is conversions. But we're thrilled to be in full market release, and the team is excited to just be \u2013 in full promotion mode starting Q3. Yeah. Hi, Chris. The pricing of Omnipod 5 versus DASH, remember, we said we would price it at parity to DASH, and we're sticking to that. So we are offering payers the exact same rebates for Omnipod 5 that we offered for DASH. The exception to that \u2013 and the reason you might see some discrepancies in pricing are mainly around mix. And remember, Omnipod 5 is a pharmacy-only product. So we did have a few payers that were in DME that we are not offering Omnipod 5 in DME and so they do have to move to the pharmacy channel. So that will cause you know a little bit of price lift, frankly, in the pharmacy channel for the average pod pricing, but per payer, there's pricing at parity with just a few exceptions. Yeah, Joanne, this is Bret. Yeah, you know most of the learnings from the US, we can translate to a European launch. And so remember, there's a lot to learn from Omnipod 5. It's \u2013 there's self-service, there's different training. We've learned a lot with training and support in coordination with Dexcom, our CGM partner. So all of those will serve us well when we launch in Europe. There's still work to do. And Jim mentioned, you know we are well on our way to CE Mark in Europe. And we've still got work to do even after CE Mark. So, you know we are targeting middle of \u201823 for the first markets in Europe to come on board, and that will \u2013 that effort will move into \u201824, because they are going to be staggered launches. So there's work to do with the cloud. And remember, we're pioneering here. You know, we are going to be the first company that's getting real-time data on every single user. So we're putting a SIM card in PDMs. We're building a cloud that meets the requirements of every country. And then we're assessing the reimbursement environment. We've got to establish reimbursement for an AID system that is Omnipod, and we're looking at the potential for different pricing in those markets. So, all-in-all, there's work to be done even after CE Mark, and you can expect those launches to come in a staggered fashion starting in the middle of \u201823. Yeah, Cecilia, this is Bret. So you know the list is long of what we learned in the LMR. And you know we're thrilled again to be moving to full market release. But we commented on some of what we've learned. A lot has to do with the onboarding experience. We adjusted the trading protocols, some of the self-service options, some of the expectation setting for those that might be coming from an AID system versus MDI, there's a lot to learn there, and we got really comfortable with that, which is why we're moving to full market release. The free trials. Certainly, yes. So, the 10-days is a great question, because we are committed to free trial with Omnipod 5, and you know it was a 30-day free trial with DASH. And while we wanted to do that same trial with Omnipod 5, Omnipod 5 is a system that includes the Dexcom, CGM. So, that was really in coordination with our partner there and Dexcom, as they offer a free 10-day trial, we want to make sure that we're not offering a trial that doesn't include a CGM. So a lot of work there and a lot of coordination that went into that, but we're committed to doing free trials for Omnipod 5, and it's something you will see us continue to offer. Yeah. Margaret, I mean, it's \u2013 you know this inventory build is almost something that's just unavoidable with a product launch like Omnipod 5. I mean, ideally, you'd love to see the DASH inventory drop at the same rate that Omnipod 5 is going up. But look, we try to project this as well as we can and communicate with our distributors. And I think it's fair to say demand just exceeded our expectations here, you know especially with conversions. So the one thing we have to point to was when we launched DASH, we did see conversions from our legacy product, but demand for Omnipod 5 is just much different. And we have podders who have been waiting for Omnipod 5 for a long time. And that is \u2013 you know we just saw a lot more conversions, a lot more demand, and that resulted in a little bit of inventory build. But again, it's healthy, and we try to keep it to a minimum. Hi, Josh, it's Bret, Brian, sorry. We think cost is very important. And it's one of the reasons why years ago, we decided to move to the pharmacy channel, more importantly, move to a pay-as-you-go model, because it is \u2013 the upfront fee is very disruptive and very difficult for patients, especially if they have not met their deductibles. So you know for us, we don't see these type of headwinds and these fluctuations, because the co-pays in the pharmacy are predictable and they're low. And remember, the majority \u2013 the vast majority of our patients pay something less than $50. So the average is much lower than that. And as Jim said, many pay zero. So you know the pay-as-you-go model is really important. We topped that off with free trial, you know and you can try Omnipod for free, if you want to. And then, I think the final part of your question is about lowering co-pays, and that's just an effort we're always making. And we talk about that as functional access. So we want to do a few things. We want to remove prior offs. We want to remove high co-pays. And in some cases, we're willing to give up a little bit on the rebate percentage with payers if we can get that accomplished, because we want to remove every obstacle we can to get it on Omnipod."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Hollingshead, member of Insulet's Board of Directors and Insulet's future President and CEO. Shacey and Wayde, along with Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will be available for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 first quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about this afternoon's announcement that for personal reasons, I will be stepping down from my executive positions at Insulet. After careful consideration over some time, I have made the very difficult decision to reduce my professional obligations in light of medical issues and other circumstances that have been impacting my family and those I care deeply about. Effective June 1, Jim Hollingshead, a member of our Board of Directors since 2019, will succeed me as President and CEO. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished in my time as CEO. We have made significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes while enhancing Insulet's ability to innovate and operate with excellence. Insulet is well positioned for the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5 and poised for continued growth and impact for shareholders and the diabetes community. I remain profoundly committed to Insulet and the company's long-term success, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a director on Insulet's Board and as an adviser to Jim and the team. I will be working hand-in-hand with Jim to ensure a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities. In recent years, we have made great progress improving the lives of people with diabetes by delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing the company's global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Hundreds of thousands of Podders around the world are leading happier and healthier lives because of our work and dedication. And with Omnipod 5, we will offer significantly improved outcomes and incredibly simplified diabetes management to millions of people across the globe. I have never been more excited or confident about Insulet's future. Insulet has a deep, talented team and is firing on all cylinders and poised for incredible growth. I know Jim well from our service on the Insulet Board together, and I'm delighted that he is the one to step into the role of CEO at this important time. The company will be in great hands under his leadership. He knows our company, our culture and our team and the strong relationships he has fostered with our management team will immediately serve the company well and ensure a smooth transition. His significant experience at the rapidly evolving crossroads of medical technology and digital solutions will also be incredibly valuable to the company. Jim has joined us today, and I'd like to turn the call over to him for a few remarks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, Shacey. Shacey and I have built a terrific working relationship, and I'm very pleased that she will continue to serve on Insulet's Board and in addition, serve in an advisory role with the company. Shacey's continued active involvement and oversight will be incredibly valuable. This gives me great confidence that we won't miss a beat. Under Shacey's remarkable leadership, Insulet has delivered tremendous growth. The company has pioneered innovations that deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes, and I will work hard to build on that legacy. On a personal note, I'm excited to spend a lot more time in our company's headquarters. I plan to get a place here and also maintain my residence in Southern California, near Insulet's operations in San Diego and Tijuana. I am also looking forward to getting out on the road over the next several months to meet with Insulet's amazing employees as well as the company's business partners, analysts, investors and other stakeholders. In closing, I am honored to assume the role of President and CEO of Insulet at this important time, and I'm energized by working alongside our excellent leadership team and talented employees to continue advancing our mission and strategic imperatives. We are well positioned to build on Insulet's momentum to drive significant value for shareholders and to continue to execute our mission. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Shacey for commentary on the quarter.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Jim. We are off to a great start in 2022 with financial results that finished ahead of expectations as our team continues to execute and build on the momentum in our business. We, once again, had record Q1 U.S. and global new customer starts in the first quarter, building on our success throughout 2021. We have meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives and are on track for another successful year. Our position in the underserved global diabetes market has never been stronger. We are especially excited about the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received during our limited market release from users of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system with full compatible smartphone control. The feedback has been nothing short of spectacular. Users love the system and have shared how it greatly simplifies their diabetes management and is truly changing their lives. HCP feedback has been equally strong. Our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are well underway, including our CE mark submission under active review, and we continue to expand our global presence. We also recently shared compelling data from our type 2 feasibility study at the ATTD diabetes conference, which demonstrates the value Omnipod 5 can bring to the type 2 community. Omnipod offers an unmatched option for people living with type 2 diabetes given our pay-as-you-go model, pharmacy access, attractive form factor, growing clinical evidence and unparalleled simplicity. In the first quarter, type 2 users represented approximately 35% of our U.S. new customer starts. Our competitive advantages and exciting innovation pipelines in both the type 1 and type 2 market segments position us to drive long-term revenue growth, increase our market share and total addressable market and expand our margins. Also, last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report to provide all of our stakeholders a view into Insulet's approach to environmental, social and governance programs and the exciting progress we've made across a number of fronts. Just a few examples. In 2021, we reached 60% gender diversity on Insulet's Board, millions of used pods were diverted from landfills globally through product take-back programs and solar panels at our Massachusetts headquarters generated almost 800,000 kilowatt hours of renewable energy. Insulet is committed to the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy: resilient operations, sustainable product innovation and people and communities. And it is encouraging to see us continue to mature across each of these areas. Now turning to an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Today, we are working to expand access to an awareness of Omnipod given the global diabetes market is underpenetrated and growing. We continue to drive increased adoption through the U.S. pharmacy channel, which makes access to Omnipod easier and more affordable by eliminating lengthy lock-in periods and heavy upfront costs. Our pay-as-you-go model removes risk for payers while also providing a superior and affordable experience for our customers. The cost of Omnipod is consistent with multiple daily injections despite Omnipod's form factor, ease of use and improved outcomes. As a result, we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. Nearly all of our global new customers start on Omnipod DASH. And in the U.S. do so primarily through the pharmacy channel. Once we move into full market release this year, we can't wait to offer Omnipod 5 solely through the pharmacy. We also continue to drive increased awareness of Omnipod through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign as well as our 30-day free trial. Our DTC investment in the U.S. is ramping in support of Omnipod 5. In addition, we continue to invest in DTC in select international markets, which is helping to drive new customer starts and increase awareness of Omnipod. Brand recognition is strong internationally, and these efforts will further raise awareness for Omnipod DASH in advance of our international launch of Omnipod 5. Our Omnipod 5 U.S. limited market release continues to progress as planned. In March, we made the smartphone app available. And we continue to roll out availability on a growing list of Android phone models, including those most widely used in the U.S. The feedback on full smartphone control has been remarkable and highlights how differentiated an experience Omnipod 5 offers. Consistent with what we've heard to date, I will share feedback from one user who has tried multiple forms of insulin delivery for 35 years, including tubed pumps. He said, he has never been in better control. His fears of lows are almost gone. Having diabetes is no longer at the forefront of his thinking and he has confidence in the algorithm to quickly get him to his customized target. He said, he knew Omnipod 5 was going to be good, but he didn't anticipate just how good. All of this feedback validates the years of hard work our teams have put into the development of Omnipod 5 to deliver the best customer experience. With this launch, we have also created a customer service platform centered on simplifying the Omnipod 5 onboarding process and scaling our ability to train users. As an example, today, if you are a current Omnipod and Dexcom user, you have the ability to adopt Omnipod 5 through a 100% digital pathway without having to meet with a clinician or be trained by a field rep. This makes Omnipod easier to access for our customers. While we continue to test the Omnipod 5 customer journeys, our market access team is successfully securing expanded coverage. We are well on our way to achieving our internal target by full market release. After successful completion of the first phase of our limited market release, we recently expanded the availability of Omnipod 5 through a limited distribution network as planned. Now any doctor can write a prescription for Omnipod 5 and a growing number of people will have access to it. We know Omnipod 5 is going to be a game changer for people with diabetes, and we can't wait to bring it to the broader community. Our Omnipod 5 submission for an expanded indication down to age 2 is under active review with the FDA and progressing well, and we continue to plan for updated labeling this year. We also recently shared compelling data from the initial 8-week phase of our type 2 feasibility study. This was the first prospective AID study of people with type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. and included participants with an average age of 61 years who used Omnipod 5 at home. Only one individual had experience with an insulin pump and approximately half had never used a CGM. The study results were impressive. The data demonstrated an overall A1c reduction of 1.3%, along with an additional 4.6 hours a day in normal glycemic range. Participants who were previously on MDI experienced reduced time in hypoglycemia and a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. We believe the benefits that users experience during our study are indicative of how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for people with type 2 diabetes, and we remain committed to continuing to innovate to meet the needs of this important group. We also continue to advance our robust product pipeline, including next generations of our Omnipod 5 platform. This includes our iOS development, which is progressing very well, as is our integration work with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. While Omnipod 5 is a priority today, we know competing and winning in the underserved global diabetes market requires a firm commitment to innovation. We have a compelling pipeline that includes next-generation AID technology, robust, data-driven and digital innovations and additional technological advancements designed to expand our total addressable markets. Lastly, we continue to build on our strong patent portfolio. We had a record-setting number of patent filings in 2021 and expect to set another record this year. Our current technology as well as our exciting innovation pipeline are well protected and should further strengthen our global leadership in diabetes technology. Diabetes is a growing epidemic with millions of people diagnosed each year, and Omnipod is already making a difference in 23 countries. We are focused on further penetrating our existing markets, expanding our total addressable market by growing our presence in new regions and launching Omnipod 5 internationally. Our CE mark submission is progressing well, and we are making terrific progress preparing for an Omnipod 5 international launch. We are further building our teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. AID and CGM awareness and adoption are increasing globally, helping to unlock reimbursement and access pathways. As a result, we will be well positioned to leapfrog the competition and have Omnipod 5 become the preferred AID system in our global markets. In terms of market expansion, last month, we launched Omnipod DASH in Saudi Arabia and expect to enter the United Arab Emirates shortly. Together, these countries increase our total addressable market by approximately 1 million people. And the overall international opportunity represents a significant long-term growth driver. Our global manufacturing capabilities offer another competitive advantage. And we are taking steps to further strengthen our operations. In addition to focusing on supply chain resiliency and ensuring critical component supply, we are also optimizing our international manufacturing footprint. The current macro, inflationary and supply chain environment is challenging. However, our team has been successful in partially offsetting the inflation impact and has also mitigated supply chain risk to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers. All of their accomplishments should help ensure we have ample component supply and available capacity to meet the demands of our customers, including our full launch of Omnipod 5. Wayde will discuss our manufacturing operations in more detail. In closing, our first quarter results finished ahead of our expectations, and we are off to a great start in 2022. We are making terrific progress in the limited market release of Omnipod 5. And looking ahead, the balance of the year will include a number of important milestones, including the full commercial release of Omnipod 5, an expanded indication down to age 2 and advancement of our innovation pipeline. 2022 is going to be another exciting year for us as well as our customers across the globe. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Shacey. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to express my own gratitude towards Shacey and also do so on behalf of all of our employees. Her outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to both the company and people living with diabetes has set up Insulet for a bright future. She embodies our mission. It has been an honor to learn from her and work alongside the group of leaders she has assembled here. We look forward to working with Shacey in her continued role as a Board member and as a company adviser and continuing to benefit from her insights and guidance. At the same time, I'm excited to welcome Jim into his new position. It has been great working with Jim on the Board of Directors to date, and I echo Shacey's confidence in his deep understanding of our business, our culture and our team. And now on to our results. We started the year off well with strong first quarter results, made notable progress in all of our strategic imperatives and are on a path for another successful year. In the first quarter, we generated 19% revenue growth, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 220 basis point headwind over Q1 of last year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth was driven by the compounding benefit from strong new customer starts as well as increasing volume growth through the U.S. pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove approximately 90% of our U.S. new customer starts and pharmacy channel volume increased to over 55% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue grew 12% and was above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of the pandemic over the past year and AID competition headwinds. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 640 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition remains stable. Despite a shift in U.S. volume into the pharmacy channel, global pod utilization also remained consistent with historical seasonality as we typically see a sequential decrease in the first quarter of the year driven by the U.S. Drug delivery revenue increased 36%, exceeding our guidance range due to production timing. Gross margin was 71% and above our expectations, representing a 460 basis point increase or 490 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were improved manufacturing operations, growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and product mix. These were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a reminder, our current inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary headwinds in 2021 that continue in 2022. This will pressure gross margin sequentially each quarter this year as we sell the product out of inventory. I'll provide more color on our expected 2022 gross margin cadence in a few minutes. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations and reflect ongoing investments in innovation, sales and marketing and international expansion. Our focus to further strengthen these critical areas supports our long-term growth trajectory and expansion of our global addressable market. Operating margin was 12.8%, up 630 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.3%, up 740 basis points. Both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin improvement and to a lesser extent, timing. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and provides opportunities to continue to invest across our business. We've taken steps to further strengthen our global manufacturing scale and flexibility, including consolidating our production in China into our newer lower cost facility. We also expect to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. These actions are intended to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply and drive margin improvement over time. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are maintaining our full year revenue range of 12% to 16% and raising the low end for total Omnipod by 100 basis points to 16% to 20%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end by 100 basis points to 19% to 23%. Our growth within the type 1 and type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. The Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given we are in limited market release for part of 2022 and due to our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by pandemic impacts and AID competition headwinds. As a reminder, we expect international revenue growth will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a slightly easier comparison as well as an anticipated improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, we continue to expect drug delivery revenue to decline 30% to 35% as 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Despite increasing inflationary and supply chain pressure, we continue to expect to achieve 67% to 68%. The drivers of the decline from last year remain the same: product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume; higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp; and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. All partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect gross margin to decline sequentially throughout the year due to the various factors discussed as well as higher component costs included in inventory. We were happy to exceed 70% gross margin this quarter. And after working through inflationary impacts for the next couple of years, we still have plans to achieve 70% on a sustained basis over time. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in 2022 as we increase investments. Key areas of investments include our expanding innovation pipeline, direct-to-consumer advertising, clinical efforts and the launch of Omnipod 5. As a result of the higher macro and inflationary supply chain and foreign exchange pressures, we now expect operating margin to be flat year-over-year. Despite these headwinds, we are still focused on expanding operating margin over time. For Q2, given both the expected sequential decline in gross margin and the increasing sequential investment to support the Omnipod 5 launch and other initiatives, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures will grow slightly this year as we continue to invest in key areas of our business. Turning to our second quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 12% to 15%, including total Omnipod growth of 17% to 20%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate the unfavorable impact will be approximately 400 basis points on a reported basis. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect to continue to build momentum with growth of 21% to 24%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model and growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. As a reminder and as planned, Omnipod 5 is still in limited market release and will not contribute materially to revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q2 international Omnipod growth of 9% to 12%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic and competitive AID headwinds. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,100 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q2 drug delivery revenue to decline 43% to 37% year-over-year, which is also a significant sequential decline as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. There will be choppiness in the remaining quarterly revenue based on our partners requested order patterns and timing of production. In conclusion, we've begun 2022 much like we ended 2021, strong execution against our strategic imperatives that position Insulet well for long-term sustainable growth. While our mission has not changed, our ability to deliver on it only gets stronger. We've never been in a better position to improve the lives of people with diabetes. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Congratulations on a nice quarter. And Shacey, congratulations on all the success you've had at Insulet. I know you'll be missed. I'd love to start with a question for Jim. I heard he's on the line. Is that okay? Could you hear me okay? Operator?\nOperator: Yes. One moment, sir.\nShacey Petrovic: Dalam, are you on the line?\nOperator: Yes. I am on the line.\nShacey Petrovic: Okay. We've dialed back in. So you've got the Insulet team back here, Shacey, Wayde, Bret and Deb.\nOperator: Okay. All right. So go ahead Mr. Biegelsen, could you please repeat your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Sure. Well, first, Shacey, congratulations on the nice quarter here, and congratulations on the success you've had at Insulet. I know you'll be missed. I heard that Jim was on. Shacey, is it okay to ask Jim a question?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure.\nLarry Biegelsen: Sure, if Jim is on. So Jim, I think maybe this is the first time many of us are hearing from you, certainly in this role. So Jim, you've been on the Board of Insulet since 2019, so you know the company well. So I'd love to hear what your goals are over the next year? And how are you thinking about Insulet more broadly? Do you see opportunities outside of diabetes? Congratulations on your new role.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, Larry. I really appreciate the question. Look, I have been on the Insulet Board now for 3 years. And the first thing I would say is, it's such an honor to be entrusted with leadership for our next chapter of growth by Shacey and by the whole Board. I think Shacey's leadership has just been remarkable. It's one of the main reasons I was drawn to join the Board and was so privileged to join the Board. And Shacey has accomplished so many things in her tenure here, 7-year tenure here and 3 years as CEO, we wouldn't have time to list them all. But I will say one of the main things that Shacey has accomplished is she's built this incredible executive team here at Insulet. And so when I think about stepping in, I think we're not going to miss a beat. I think the key thing is that we continue to grow. We continue to succeed with innovation. We're driving opportunities to change the lives of people with diabetes. We're in the middle of a fantastic product launch with a revolutionary product. And couple that with the fact that Shacey is going to stay on the Board, which is, I'm just really excited. She's going to continue to advise us in a formal capacity. I think the key thing is we're just charging straight ahead, and we're not going to miss a beat.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. And I'll also add, Shacey, we'll miss you, wish you the best. And Jim, welcome, looking forward to working with you. I wanted to ask on new patients here. Maybe you could walk us through what happened in first quarter in terms of new patient adds. Some of your peers faced some difficult times in January, February. Maybe if you could comment on U.S. new patient growth and international new patient growth and what it was for the quarter and how it trended. We're looking and focused more on the exit rate. And I just wanted to clarify the comments you made. Is a full launch still possible in the second quarter? I just wanted to clarify it based on the comments you made.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe I'll just reiterate at a high level, Q1 was a record quarter for us, both globally and in the U.S. It was a record Q1. So a really strong start to the year. Bret, do you want to add some detail there?\nBret Christensen: Just, Robbie, we're selling our strength, still the only tubeless form factor in the market, the simplicity of Omnipod. And then we do believe, again, that the message that the fastest pathway to Omnipod 5 is to get DASH, and that seems to be resonating, and we believe there's a little bit of a lift there as well. But all in all, this is another record quarter for new starts, and we're happy with the performance in the U.S. and around the globe.\nShacey Petrovic: And to your second question regarding Omnipod 5 and the full market release, we were excited to expand our limited market release. I think Bret and the team did a really smart thing there expanding through specialty and mail-order pharmacies, which is about where 20% of our business goes through today. About 80% of it goes through retail, and we're not yet in retail. But I would just caution anybody from thinking about it as a flip of the switch. So we're going to continue to ramp here towards full market release. And right now, we're going from sort of hundreds of patients to thousands of patients. So of course, I guess, June is still possible, but we have to give ourselves the room to take any learnings that might occur from this move from hundreds of patients to thousands of patients and make sure that we react to those, incorporate those learnings and that we are fully prepared for a full market release and entering into the retail channel when we get there. So hopefully, that gives you good guidance.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities.\nTravis Steed: Congrats, Shacey, on all the things you've done at Insulet, going to miss working with you as well, and look forward to working with you, too, Jim. So on the Omnipod 5 rollout, I guess, just give a little more color on some of the initial feedback you've gotten from some of the initial users. And I'm trying to understand the cadence here of the launch, like what's the next step? Are you going to go to the retail channel all at once or step by step? And just a better understanding about kind of the rate limiting factor on the rollout would be great.\nBret Christensen: Travis, it's Bret. I can give a little bit more color on the limited market release to full market release. So it's probably helpful to start with the end and how we are defining the full market release. And we do define a full market release as being in the retail channel, which Shacey said is where 80% of our pharmacy business is today. So this next phase is with a limited distribution network and that just means mostly mail-order and a smaller number of distributors. But it does mean that any physician can write a prescription and any patient that has access and reimbursement can get our product. They just have to go through a channel that maybe they're not currently going through in the pharmacy channel. So it won't be a flip of the switch, as Shacey said. We'll continue to progress in that way. What's exciting, I guess, about this next phase is that it does test our scale. So we started with hundreds, a predetermined number of patients in the LMR. Now we're going to start driving prescriptions, scaling the release. And it will continue to scale until we get to the full market release. We'll continue to learn. And a lot of what we're learning today is around the pathway that patients take to get on product. If you remember, we talked about the limited market release in probably hundreds of different pathways, depending on what a user's current experience is with CGM, with MDI, tubed pumps, et cetera, that they could take a unique training pathway for each of them. So some of the things we're learning in LMR is just how to tweak that experience a little bit to maybe set better expectations with some of those patients so that when they start, they know exactly what to expect with Omnipod 5. And we'll continue to learn, but we're right on track to what we said we would do, which is sometime between 3 and 9 months. We're 3 months in now. And we're excited about this next phase. But the next phase really is after this one really is full market release, and we'll just progress until we get there, which is a retail launch.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeff Johnson: And Shacey, nothing but the best. I just want you to know how much I've appreciated holding you up as such a great example of professional success for my 17-year-old daughter. And let me just ask a question outside the U.S. I know a lot of questions on the U.S. O5 launch. But outside the U.S., have you had any conversations with EU regulatory authorities at this point? Just maybe any updated thoughts on time line to CE mark and how soon you could maybe flip over to commercialization once you do get CE mark?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I'll maybe just give you an update on the submission and then Bret can talk a little bit about the market development and market preparation for launch that's underway. So we've had a lot of back and forth with our notified body. And we believe that the submission is progressing very well, no red flags. And we were really well prepared because we had such a comprehensive FDA submission and also because our data was so strong. So we do feel like we're in a really strong position. The only challenge in terms of giving you guidelines or guidance for timing is just that the MDR pathway is just a relatively new pathway, both to us and our notified body. So that's the challenge, but we are making great progress and feel very confident about that happening. It's just hard to give you some particular timing on that. And then there's been a ton of work underway preparing for market launch. So Bret, if you want to provide some color on that?\nBret Christensen: Sure. Jeff, we're doing a lot of work now to prepare for the launch of Omnipod 5 outside the U.S. And contrasting it to our DASH launch, if you remember when we got approval for DASH, it was pretty quickly that we rolled out to all of our markets internationally and very quickly got to almost 100% of all new starts on DASH. The difference with Omnipod 5 is probably twofold. One, there's infrastructure with the cloud that's going to be unique by country depending on data privacy and different requirements. The other thing is reimbursement. So the reimbursement pathway for each country is different frankly because this is a new category of product where DASH was simply the same category as our legacy product. So there's different reimbursement pathways, different infrastructure to consider. And so you'll probably see more of a staged launch by country outside the U.S. once we do get clearance.\nOperator: I show the next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman: Shacey, all the best to you. And good luck, Jim, in your new role. I wanted to also ask on financial, excuse me, on international, saw some nice upside there in 1Q. I guess, one, are you seeing some of the Omnipod 5 excitement starting to build, giving greater visibility that it's coming with the CE mark filing and U.S. approval, so seeing some pull forward as Bret mentioned earlier with U.S. And it would seem that based on the second quarter guidance coming off of this better 1Q that you could be trending towards the high end of your full year range. So overall, how are you feeling about that international business even ahead of Omnipod 5?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Steven, I can comment probably on the first part and pass it over to Wayde for any color on guidance. But yes, we're really pleased with how the international markets are performing. Of course, there's a ton of optimism and excitement for Omnipod 5. And it's why we are excited to be under CE mark review, and we're working ambitiously to get it to market. Just like the U.S., we know it will make a difference in new starts, in demand and that there's this desire to have the best form factor paired with an AID system. So of course, there's tons of interest outside the U.S. We're trying to manage that with our current base and expectations with our partners over there, but that's why the work is so important that we get it to market, and we're excited about the CE mark. And again, we'll plan accordingly, but we'll phase the launch depending on the readiness of each market, considering the size and opportunity. And we're so excited to get there. And maybe, Wayde, you can talk a little bit about what that means.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Sounds good. As Bret said, we're doing very well competing with the form factor. And so we've been in this low teens, low double digits range now for a little over a year. And it's good double-digit growth, but we know we could be growing faster if we had our AID system as we've talked about. We just don't participate in that part of the market today. And so that's what's reflected in our Q2 guide as well as you mentioned, Steve, for the full year. And just a reminder, the second half of the year guide is a little stronger because we have a slightly easing comp especially in Q4. And then the impact of the pandemic over the last 4 quarters, just to remind everybody with our annuity model, impacts us. And so even though the pandemic is easing, we're still annualizing those quarters from last year. And so as we do that throughout the year, you'll see our growth rates start to strengthen in the second half.\nOperator: I show the next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Securities.\nDanielle Antalffy: And Shacey, I can't even tell you how bummed I am to hear that you are leaving and you will definitely be missed. You've been a girl crush of mine for a long time. So don't worry, you'll stay my girl crush. So just a question on primary care physician. We've been doing a lot of work on the diabetes space, and it feels like there's still so much learning to be had on the primary care side of things for pumps and CGMs, which is actually the crux of a lot of the work we've been doing. I'm just curious about how you guys at Insulet are going after the primary care doctor and how it's different versus the endo? And how you think the mix, the prescriber mix will evolve over time? So yes, I'll leave it at that.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Danielle. I'm not going anywhere. I do plan to do everything in my power as an adviser and a Board member to continue to support Insulet's success. And I know it's in great hands with Jim and his outstanding team. Maybe, Bret, do you want to comment on the primary care part?\nBret Christensen: Yes. Danielle, we spent a lot of time thinking about primary care because as we desire to penetrate the type 2 market, in particular, more vigorously that many of them do reside with primary care. So today, we're getting leads in primary care mainly through our DTC campaigns. We get a lot of patients to see their physician. And so we're sort of reactive for the most part with primary care because we're waiting for a patient to become a lead and then we're reaching out to that particular primary care doc and getting them started on Omnipod DASH. But we also do call on a very small number of primary care physicians, but mainly those that sort of operate like an endocrinologist and write a lot of insulin prescriptions, for instance. We get good information from IQVIA. We know who they are. But we do want to expand more into that segment. I think a couple of things are the challenge with primary care that we have to solve for. One is just their willingness to tackle complexity. And they see pump therapy, in general, has been more complex than something they typically do today. So we have to solve for that. Virtual training is the way we can do that. The simpler we make the product, the easier it is to onboard the pharmacy channel, low co-pays. All those things we're doing will help, for sure. The other thing is just breadth. There's over 200,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. We obviously will have a sales force to tackle that. So we'll look to penetrate primary care in the future through more direct-to-consumer, more digital marketing and then ultimately better solutions and products that more succinctly fit the type 2 segment. But there's a lot of work to do there. Most of the success we're having with type 2 today is within the endocrinology segment, but we know the opportunity is massive and we do get a lot of leads from direct-to-consumer.\nOperator: I show the next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: And may I also say thank you and good luck. And I don't know, anything more than that, I might start crying. So 2 quick questions. What percentage of your new patients were type 2? And the second question has to do with your new patients that are coming on and you expect to see using Omnipod 5. Are those transfer students from your current platform or do you see it pulling more patients from MDI and/or tubed pumps?\nShacey Petrovic: Joanne, yes, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 35% approximately of our new users were type 2. So it's great to see continued really strong growth, particularly in a record Q1. And as it relates to Omnipod 5, we've been pretty limited there. So it's a very small sample at this point relative to our total base. So we said hundreds of patients and they're coming from all segments because we wanted to test every customer journey that we can. So we're in still process of testing all those customer journeys, so we've got people coming on from MDI, from existing Omnipod users and also from tubed pumps and AID pumps and managing to get really good insights across each of those customer journeys. As we look ahead, we've talked about the fact that today, we get 80% of our new users from multiple daily injections. And it will be really interesting to see what happens with that segment. I think we believe that Omnipod 5 has the power to continue to grow the overall market and bring great better outcomes, better quality of life to people who are relying on multiple daily injections. But we also know that this is a more competitive offering for those people who were choosing AID over form factor and now they can have both. So we're pretty excited to see what that means for our percentages and our ratios and whether or not we have transfer students or new students as we look forward.\nOperator: I show the next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: And Shacey, I hope everything is okay, manageable and best of luck to you going forward. Just to follow up a little bit on Joanne's question, the comment about maybe I think Bret mentioned a little bit of a push on the DASH side this quarter. And then I think you said type 2s are 35% this quarter. And I don't want to make too big a deal with this, but 35% to 40% is what you said last quarter. So what I'm really getting at is, are you seeing more type 1 patients coming on, getting access through DASH to get access to Omnipod 5?\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Great question. And I think we likely are. And that was Bret's point that, in fact, the fastest way to get on to Omnipod 5, which we know today is indicated for the type 1 user is through Omnipod DASH. So we do believe that part of that is what's driving our record new customer starts and also probably driving a slight shift in percentages there. But I don't want to dismiss the fact that 35% of our new users are type 2. The product Omnipod DASH is still doing tremendous things for that segment, bringing better outcomes and still obviously an incredibly appealing product that's driving great growth there.\nOperator: I show the next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford.\nJayson Bedford: And Shacey, I wish you the best. I hope everything works out. Just so I understand the current phase of the limited market release and it was kind of touched on before, but any physician can write a script, but the user has to access the technology in the specialty channel, kind of the non-retail pharmacy channel. I'm just wondering, is this due to capacity on your part? Is it more of a reflection of your discussion with payers? Just wondering what you need to see before you broaden the launch.\nBret Christensen: Jayson, it's Bret. I can give a little bit of color around that. So yes, any physician can write a prescription. You're right. And any patient that has access to the product, they just can't, for instance, pick up a prescription and walk down the street to their Walgreens or CVS and expect to get Omnipod at that retail location for now. There's a couple of reasons why we would do this and use this limited distributor network for the LMR and the expanded phase of the LMR. One, as you know, we just get better visibility to who's starting. Once you start to ship product to the retail channel, it's out there. And so we don't have as much visibility and that doesn't help us with our goal of really monitoring people that are coming on, monitoring their experience and having the ability to quickly reach out to them if necessary. So this keeps us closer to the patient. It keeps us closer to the process. We get more feedback on their onboarding pathway. And it just gets us more comfortable with finally shipping product to the retail channel, which is, again, how we'll define full market release. So it's a good step. We think it does broadly open up access. But at the same time, helps us meet our goals of measuring and monitoring as we expand to the retail launch.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: This is Brandon on for Margaret. I'd like to just echo the sentiment from the rest of the sell-side community and thanking Shacey for all her work, and congrats on building a great organization here. I wanted to focus my question on the type 2 pathway as well. We obviously saw really encouraging data with Omnipod 5 at ATTD. So that was both in MDI and basal. What are the next steps here for you to kind of keep moving forward, getting an Omnipod 5 type 2 label? Do you need to make any software or hardware changes? Do you need an additional trial to kind of understand the market or can you kind of just roll into a pivotal? So any color you can give around there just to understand at least the pathway if we can't get a time line on that.\nShacey Petrovic: Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Yes, the data was really strong. It was really great to see. Our feasibility study included type 2 users that were at a pretty low baseline of control. So I mentioned many who had not used the CGM and only one who had used a pump. So really representative of that broad type 2 population out there. Baselines were at 32% time in range for basal-only and 46% time in range for MDI. And depending on that cohort, we saw a 30% to 50% increase in time in range, so quite extraordinary performance there. So I think overall, we feel like we're in a, the feasibility data accomplished what it did or what we set out to do, which is demonstrate that this technology has probably enormous value in the type 2 population. So this supports our discussions. This data supports our discussions with the FDA to determine the right size and design for our pivotal study. This is really the, probably the wrap-up of our feasibility study and then we will move into a pivotal. We believe that pivotal study is likely to look very similar based on our early discussions, very similar to the type 1 pivotal, so hundreds of patients over 3 months looking at similar endpoints. But we need to finalize those discussions. We're in discussions with the FDA on a number of fronts regarding type 2 diabetes. And once we finalize that design and then start recruiting for the pivotal, you guys will be the first to know. And I guess I'd just emphasize that in the meantime, we have this great product with DASH that's making a difference for people with type 2. That will continue to drive value for us. And it also continues to help us learn more and more about the clinician population and the patient population that we're serving with type 2.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic.\nShacey Petrovic: Thanks, Dalam. So I think you all know that it has been the honor of my career to lead the remarkable team at Insulet. And I know the company is in great hands with Jim leading the organization into its next chapter. As you heard today, Insulet is delivering terrific results and is poised for even greater growth and value creation for our shareholders and people with diabetes across the globe as we progress toward the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5. I am really excited to continue supporting and contributing to our success as a director and adviser. Insulet is just getting started, and our future is very bright. Thanks for your support, your comments today and taking the time to join the call. Have a great afternoon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Shacey. Shacey and I have built a terrific working relationship, and I'm very pleased that she will continue to serve on Insulet's Board and in addition, serve in an advisory role with the company. Shacey's continued active involvement and oversight will be incredibly valuable. This gives me great confidence that we won't miss a beat. Under Shacey's remarkable leadership, Insulet has delivered tremendous growth. The company has pioneered innovations that deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes, and I will work hard to build on that legacy. On a personal note, I'm excited to spend a lot more time in our company's headquarters. I plan to get a place here and also maintain my residence in Southern California, near Insulet's operations in San Diego and Tijuana. I am also looking forward to getting out on the road over the next several months to meet with Insulet's amazing employees as well as the company's business partners, analysts, investors and other stakeholders. In closing, I am honored to assume the role of President and CEO of Insulet at this important time, and I'm energized by working alongside our excellent leadership team and talented employees to continue advancing our mission and strategic imperatives. We are well positioned to build on Insulet's momentum to drive significant value for shareholders and to continue to execute our mission. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Shacey for commentary on the quarter. Thank you, Larry. I really appreciate the question. Look, I have been on the Insulet Board now for 3 years. And the first thing I would say is, it's such an honor to be entrusted with leadership for our next chapter of growth by Shacey and by the whole Board. I think Shacey's leadership has just been remarkable. It's one of the main reasons I was drawn to join the Board and was so privileged to join the Board. And Shacey has accomplished so many things in her tenure here, 7-year tenure here and 3 years as CEO, we wouldn't have time to list them all. But I will say one of the main things that Shacey has accomplished is she's built this incredible executive team here at Insulet. And so when I think about stepping in, I think we're not going to miss a beat. I think the key thing is that we continue to grow. We continue to succeed with innovation. We're driving opportunities to change the lives of people with diabetes. We're in the middle of a fantastic product launch with a revolutionary product. And couple that with the fact that Shacey is going to stay on the Board, which is, I'm just really excited. She's going to continue to advise us in a formal capacity. I think the key thing is we're just charging straight ahead, and we're not going to miss a beat."

            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about this afternoon's announcement that for personal reasons, I will be stepping down from my executive positions at Insulet. After careful consideration over some time, I have made the very difficult decision to reduce my professional obligations in light of medical issues and other circumstances that have been impacting my family and those I care deeply about. Effective June 1, Jim Hollingshead, a member of our Board of Directors since 2019, will succeed me as President and CEO. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished in my time as CEO. We have made significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes while enhancing Insulet's ability to innovate and operate with excellence. Insulet is well positioned for the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5 and poised for continued growth and impact for shareholders and the diabetes community. I remain profoundly committed to Insulet and the company's long-term success, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a director on Insulet's Board and as an adviser to Jim and the team. I will be working hand-in-hand with Jim to ensure a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities. In recent years, we have made great progress improving the lives of people with diabetes by delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing the company's global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Hundreds of thousands of Podders around the world are leading happier and healthier lives because of our work and dedication. And with Omnipod 5, we will offer significantly improved outcomes and incredibly simplified diabetes management to millions of people across the globe. I have never been more excited or confident about Insulet's future. Insulet has a deep, talented team and is firing on all cylinders and poised for incredible growth. I know Jim well from our service on the Insulet Board together, and I'm delighted that he is the one to step into the role of CEO at this important time. The company will be in great hands under his leadership. He knows our company, our culture and our team and the strong relationships he has fostered with our management team will immediately serve the company well and ensure a smooth transition. His significant experience at the rapidly evolving crossroads of medical technology and digital solutions will also be incredibly valuable to the company. Jim has joined us today, and I'd like to turn the call over to him for a few remarks. Thanks, Jim. We are off to a great start in 2022 with financial results that finished ahead of expectations as our team continues to execute and build on the momentum in our business. We, once again, had record Q1 U.S. and global new customer starts in the first quarter, building on our success throughout 2021. We have meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives and are on track for another successful year. Our position in the underserved global diabetes market has never been stronger. We are especially excited about the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received during our limited market release from users of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system with full compatible smartphone control. The feedback has been nothing short of spectacular. Users love the system and have shared how it greatly simplifies their diabetes management and is truly changing their lives. HCP feedback has been equally strong. Our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are well underway, including our CE mark submission under active review, and we continue to expand our global presence. We also recently shared compelling data from our type 2 feasibility study at the ATTD diabetes conference, which demonstrates the value Omnipod 5 can bring to the type 2 community. Omnipod offers an unmatched option for people living with type 2 diabetes given our pay-as-you-go model, pharmacy access, attractive form factor, growing clinical evidence and unparalleled simplicity. In the first quarter, type 2 users represented approximately 35% of our U.S. new customer starts. Our competitive advantages and exciting innovation pipelines in both the type 1 and type 2 market segments position us to drive long-term revenue growth, increase our market share and total addressable market and expand our margins. Also, last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report to provide all of our stakeholders a view into Insulet's approach to environmental, social and governance programs and the exciting progress we've made across a number of fronts. Just a few examples. In 2021, we reached 60% gender diversity on Insulet's Board, millions of used pods were diverted from landfills globally through product take-back programs and solar panels at our Massachusetts headquarters generated almost 800,000 kilowatt hours of renewable energy. Insulet is committed to the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy: resilient operations, sustainable product innovation and people and communities. And it is encouraging to see us continue to mature across each of these areas. Now turning to an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Today, we are working to expand access to an awareness of Omnipod given the global diabetes market is underpenetrated and growing. We continue to drive increased adoption through the U.S. pharmacy channel, which makes access to Omnipod easier and more affordable by eliminating lengthy lock-in periods and heavy upfront costs. Our pay-as-you-go model removes risk for payers while also providing a superior and affordable experience for our customers. The cost of Omnipod is consistent with multiple daily injections despite Omnipod's form factor, ease of use and improved outcomes. As a result, we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. Nearly all of our global new customers start on Omnipod DASH. And in the U.S. do so primarily through the pharmacy channel. Once we move into full market release this year, we can't wait to offer Omnipod 5 solely through the pharmacy. We also continue to drive increased awareness of Omnipod through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign as well as our 30-day free trial. Our DTC investment in the U.S. is ramping in support of Omnipod 5. In addition, we continue to invest in DTC in select international markets, which is helping to drive new customer starts and increase awareness of Omnipod. Brand recognition is strong internationally, and these efforts will further raise awareness for Omnipod DASH in advance of our international launch of Omnipod 5. Our Omnipod 5 U.S. limited market release continues to progress as planned. In March, we made the smartphone app available. And we continue to roll out availability on a growing list of Android phone models, including those most widely used in the U.S. The feedback on full smartphone control has been remarkable and highlights how differentiated an experience Omnipod 5 offers. Consistent with what we've heard to date, I will share feedback from one user who has tried multiple forms of insulin delivery for 35 years, including tubed pumps. He said, he has never been in better control. His fears of lows are almost gone. Having diabetes is no longer at the forefront of his thinking and he has confidence in the algorithm to quickly get him to his customized target. He said, he knew Omnipod 5 was going to be good, but he didn't anticipate just how good. All of this feedback validates the years of hard work our teams have put into the development of Omnipod 5 to deliver the best customer experience. With this launch, we have also created a customer service platform centered on simplifying the Omnipod 5 onboarding process and scaling our ability to train users. As an example, today, if you are a current Omnipod and Dexcom user, you have the ability to adopt Omnipod 5 through a 100% digital pathway without having to meet with a clinician or be trained by a field rep. This makes Omnipod easier to access for our customers. While we continue to test the Omnipod 5 customer journeys, our market access team is successfully securing expanded coverage. We are well on our way to achieving our internal target by full market release. After successful completion of the first phase of our limited market release, we recently expanded the availability of Omnipod 5 through a limited distribution network as planned. Now any doctor can write a prescription for Omnipod 5 and a growing number of people will have access to it. We know Omnipod 5 is going to be a game changer for people with diabetes, and we can't wait to bring it to the broader community. Our Omnipod 5 submission for an expanded indication down to age 2 is under active review with the FDA and progressing well, and we continue to plan for updated labeling this year. We also recently shared compelling data from the initial 8-week phase of our type 2 feasibility study. This was the first prospective AID study of people with type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. and included participants with an average age of 61 years who used Omnipod 5 at home. Only one individual had experience with an insulin pump and approximately half had never used a CGM. The study results were impressive. The data demonstrated an overall A1c reduction of 1.3%, along with an additional 4.6 hours a day in normal glycemic range. Participants who were previously on MDI experienced reduced time in hypoglycemia and a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. We believe the benefits that users experience during our study are indicative of how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for people with type 2 diabetes, and we remain committed to continuing to innovate to meet the needs of this important group. We also continue to advance our robust product pipeline, including next generations of our Omnipod 5 platform. This includes our iOS development, which is progressing very well, as is our integration work with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. While Omnipod 5 is a priority today, we know competing and winning in the underserved global diabetes market requires a firm commitment to innovation. We have a compelling pipeline that includes next-generation AID technology, robust, data-driven and digital innovations and additional technological advancements designed to expand our total addressable markets. Lastly, we continue to build on our strong patent portfolio. We had a record-setting number of patent filings in 2021 and expect to set another record this year. Our current technology as well as our exciting innovation pipeline are well protected and should further strengthen our global leadership in diabetes technology. Diabetes is a growing epidemic with millions of people diagnosed each year, and Omnipod is already making a difference in 23 countries. We are focused on further penetrating our existing markets, expanding our total addressable market by growing our presence in new regions and launching Omnipod 5 internationally. Our CE mark submission is progressing well, and we are making terrific progress preparing for an Omnipod 5 international launch. We are further building our teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. AID and CGM awareness and adoption are increasing globally, helping to unlock reimbursement and access pathways. As a result, we will be well positioned to leapfrog the competition and have Omnipod 5 become the preferred AID system in our global markets. In terms of market expansion, last month, we launched Omnipod DASH in Saudi Arabia and expect to enter the United Arab Emirates shortly. Together, these countries increase our total addressable market by approximately 1 million people. And the overall international opportunity represents a significant long-term growth driver. Our global manufacturing capabilities offer another competitive advantage. And we are taking steps to further strengthen our operations. In addition to focusing on supply chain resiliency and ensuring critical component supply, we are also optimizing our international manufacturing footprint. The current macro, inflationary and supply chain environment is challenging. However, our team has been successful in partially offsetting the inflation impact and has also mitigated supply chain risk to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers. All of their accomplishments should help ensure we have ample component supply and available capacity to meet the demands of our customers, including our full launch of Omnipod 5. Wayde will discuss our manufacturing operations in more detail. In closing, our first quarter results finished ahead of our expectations, and we are off to a great start in 2022. We are making terrific progress in the limited market release of Omnipod 5. And looking ahead, the balance of the year will include a number of important milestones, including the full commercial release of Omnipod 5, an expanded indication down to age 2 and advancement of our innovation pipeline. 2022 is going to be another exciting year for us as well as our customers across the globe. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Dalam, are you on the line? Okay. We've dialed back in. So you've got the Insulet team back here, Shacey, Wayde, Bret and Deb. Sure. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe I'll just reiterate at a high level, Q1 was a record quarter for us, both globally and in the U.S. It was a record Q1. So a really strong start to the year. Bret, do you want to add some detail there? And to your second question regarding Omnipod 5 and the full market release, we were excited to expand our limited market release. I think Bret and the team did a really smart thing there expanding through specialty and mail-order pharmacies, which is about where 20% of our business goes through today. About 80% of it goes through retail, and we're not yet in retail. But I would just caution anybody from thinking about it as a flip of the switch. So we're going to continue to ramp here towards full market release. And right now, we're going from sort of hundreds of patients to thousands of patients. So of course, I guess, June is still possible, but we have to give ourselves the room to take any learnings that might occur from this move from hundreds of patients to thousands of patients and make sure that we react to those, incorporate those learnings and that we are fully prepared for a full market release and entering into the retail channel when we get there. So hopefully, that gives you good guidance. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I'll maybe just give you an update on the submission and then Bret can talk a little bit about the market development and market preparation for launch that's underway. So we've had a lot of back and forth with our notified body. And we believe that the submission is progressing very well, no red flags. And we were really well prepared because we had such a comprehensive FDA submission and also because our data was so strong. So we do feel like we're in a really strong position. The only challenge in terms of giving you guidelines or guidance for timing is just that the MDR pathway is just a relatively new pathway, both to us and our notified body. So that's the challenge, but we are making great progress and feel very confident about that happening. It's just hard to give you some particular timing on that. And then there's been a ton of work underway preparing for market launch. So Bret, if you want to provide some color on that? Thanks, Danielle. I'm not going anywhere. I do plan to do everything in my power as an adviser and a Board member to continue to support Insulet's success. And I know it's in great hands with Jim and his outstanding team. Maybe, Bret, do you want to comment on the primary care part? Joanne, yes, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 35% approximately of our new users were type 2. So it's great to see continued really strong growth, particularly in a record Q1. And as it relates to Omnipod 5, we've been pretty limited there. So it's a very small sample at this point relative to our total base. So we said hundreds of patients and they're coming from all segments because we wanted to test every customer journey that we can. So we're in still process of testing all those customer journeys, so we've got people coming on from MDI, from existing Omnipod users and also from tubed pumps and AID pumps and managing to get really good insights across each of those customer journeys. As we look ahead, we've talked about the fact that today, we get 80% of our new users from multiple daily injections. And it will be really interesting to see what happens with that segment. I think we believe that Omnipod 5 has the power to continue to grow the overall market and bring great better outcomes, better quality of life to people who are relying on multiple daily injections. But we also know that this is a more competitive offering for those people who were choosing AID over form factor and now they can have both. So we're pretty excited to see what that means for our percentages and our ratios and whether or not we have transfer students or new students as we look forward. Sure. Great question. And I think we likely are. And that was Bret's point that, in fact, the fastest way to get on to Omnipod 5, which we know today is indicated for the type 1 user is through Omnipod DASH. So we do believe that part of that is what's driving our record new customer starts and also probably driving a slight shift in percentages there. But I don't want to dismiss the fact that 35% of our new users are type 2. The product Omnipod DASH is still doing tremendous things for that segment, bringing better outcomes and still obviously an incredibly appealing product that's driving great growth there. Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Yes, the data was really strong. It was really great to see. Our feasibility study included type 2 users that were at a pretty low baseline of control. So I mentioned many who had not used the CGM and only one who had used a pump. So really representative of that broad type 2 population out there. Baselines were at 32% time in range for basal-only and 46% time in range for MDI. And depending on that cohort, we saw a 30% to 50% increase in time in range, so quite extraordinary performance there. So I think overall, we feel like we're in a, the feasibility data accomplished what it did or what we set out to do, which is demonstrate that this technology has probably enormous value in the type 2 population. So this supports our discussions. This data supports our discussions with the FDA to determine the right size and design for our pivotal study. This is really the, probably the wrap-up of our feasibility study and then we will move into a pivotal. We believe that pivotal study is likely to look very similar based on our early discussions, very similar to the type 1 pivotal, so hundreds of patients over 3 months looking at similar endpoints. But we need to finalize those discussions. We're in discussions with the FDA on a number of fronts regarding type 2 diabetes. And once we finalize that design and then start recruiting for the pivotal, you guys will be the first to know. And I guess I'd just emphasize that in the meantime, we have this great product with DASH that's making a difference for people with type 2. That will continue to drive value for us. And it also continues to help us learn more and more about the clinician population and the patient population that we're serving with type 2. Thanks, Dalam. So I think you all know that it has been the honor of my career to lead the remarkable team at Insulet. And I know the company is in great hands with Jim leading the organization into its next chapter. As you heard today, Insulet is delivering terrific results and is poised for even greater growth and value creation for our shareholders and people with diabetes across the globe as we progress toward the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5. I am really excited to continue supporting and contributing to our success as a director and adviser. Insulet is just getting started, and our future is very bright. Thanks for your support, your comments today and taking the time to join the call. Have a great afternoon."

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Shacey. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to express my own gratitude towards Shacey and also do so on behalf of all of our employees. Her outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to both the company and people living with diabetes has set up Insulet for a bright future. She embodies our mission. It has been an honor to learn from her and work alongside the group of leaders she has assembled here. We look forward to working with Shacey in her continued role as a Board member and as a company adviser and continuing to benefit from her insights and guidance. At the same time, I'm excited to welcome Jim into his new position. It has been great working with Jim on the Board of Directors to date, and I echo Shacey's confidence in his deep understanding of our business, our culture and our team. And now on to our results. We started the year off well with strong first quarter results, made notable progress in all of our strategic imperatives and are on a path for another successful year. In the first quarter, we generated 19% revenue growth, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 220 basis point headwind over Q1 of last year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth was driven by the compounding benefit from strong new customer starts as well as increasing volume growth through the U.S. pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove approximately 90% of our U.S. new customer starts and pharmacy channel volume increased to over 55% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue grew 12% and was above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of the pandemic over the past year and AID competition headwinds. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 640 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition remains stable. Despite a shift in U.S. volume into the pharmacy channel, global pod utilization also remained consistent with historical seasonality as we typically see a sequential decrease in the first quarter of the year driven by the U.S. Drug delivery revenue increased 36%, exceeding our guidance range due to production timing. Gross margin was 71% and above our expectations, representing a 460 basis point increase or 490 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were improved manufacturing operations, growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and product mix. These were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a reminder, our current inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary headwinds in 2021 that continue in 2022. This will pressure gross margin sequentially each quarter this year as we sell the product out of inventory. I'll provide more color on our expected 2022 gross margin cadence in a few minutes. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations and reflect ongoing investments in innovation, sales and marketing and international expansion. Our focus to further strengthen these critical areas supports our long-term growth trajectory and expansion of our global addressable market. Operating margin was 12.8%, up 630 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.3%, up 740 basis points. Both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin improvement and to a lesser extent, timing. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and provides opportunities to continue to invest across our business. We've taken steps to further strengthen our global manufacturing scale and flexibility, including consolidating our production in China into our newer lower cost facility. We also expect to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. These actions are intended to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply and drive margin improvement over time. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are maintaining our full year revenue range of 12% to 16% and raising the low end for total Omnipod by 100 basis points to 16% to 20%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end by 100 basis points to 19% to 23%. Our growth within the type 1 and type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. The Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given we are in limited market release for part of 2022 and due to our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by pandemic impacts and AID competition headwinds. As a reminder, we expect international revenue growth will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a slightly easier comparison as well as an anticipated improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, we continue to expect drug delivery revenue to decline 30% to 35% as 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Despite increasing inflationary and supply chain pressure, we continue to expect to achieve 67% to 68%. The drivers of the decline from last year remain the same: product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume; higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp; and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. All partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect gross margin to decline sequentially throughout the year due to the various factors discussed as well as higher component costs included in inventory. We were happy to exceed 70% gross margin this quarter. And after working through inflationary impacts for the next couple of years, we still have plans to achieve 70% on a sustained basis over time. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in 2022 as we increase investments. Key areas of investments include our expanding innovation pipeline, direct-to-consumer advertising, clinical efforts and the launch of Omnipod 5. As a result of the higher macro and inflationary supply chain and foreign exchange pressures, we now expect operating margin to be flat year-over-year. Despite these headwinds, we are still focused on expanding operating margin over time. For Q2, given both the expected sequential decline in gross margin and the increasing sequential investment to support the Omnipod 5 launch and other initiatives, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures will grow slightly this year as we continue to invest in key areas of our business. Turning to our second quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 12% to 15%, including total Omnipod growth of 17% to 20%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate the unfavorable impact will be approximately 400 basis points on a reported basis. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect to continue to build momentum with growth of 21% to 24%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model and growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. As a reminder and as planned, Omnipod 5 is still in limited market release and will not contribute materially to revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q2 international Omnipod growth of 9% to 12%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic and competitive AID headwinds. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,100 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q2 drug delivery revenue to decline 43% to 37% year-over-year, which is also a significant sequential decline as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. There will be choppiness in the remaining quarterly revenue based on our partners requested order patterns and timing of production. In conclusion, we've begun 2022 much like we ended 2021, strong execution against our strategic imperatives that position Insulet well for long-term sustainable growth. While our mission has not changed, our ability to deliver on it only gets stronger. We've never been in a better position to improve the lives of people with diabetes. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions. Yes. Sounds good. As Bret said, we're doing very well competing with the form factor. And so we've been in this low teens, low double digits range now for a little over a year. And it's good double-digit growth, but we know we could be growing faster if we had our AID system as we've talked about. We just don't participate in that part of the market today. And so that's what's reflected in our Q2 guide as well as you mentioned, Steve, for the full year. And just a reminder, the second half of the year guide is a little stronger because we have a slightly easing comp especially in Q4. And then the impact of the pandemic over the last 4 quarters, just to remind everybody with our annuity model, impacts us. And so even though the pandemic is easing, we're still annualizing those quarters from last year. And so as we do that throughout the year, you'll see our growth rates start to strengthen in the second half."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Bret Christensen",
            "content": "Just, Robbie, we're selling our strength, still the only tubeless form factor in the market, the simplicity of Omnipod. And then we do believe, again, that the message that the fastest pathway to Omnipod 5 is to get DASH, and that seems to be resonating, and we believe there's a little bit of a lift there as well. But all in all, this is another record quarter for new starts, and we're happy with the performance in the U.S. and around the globe. Travis, it's Bret. I can give a little bit more color on the limited market release to full market release. So it's probably helpful to start with the end and how we are defining the full market release. And we do define a full market release as being in the retail channel, which Shacey said is where 80% of our pharmacy business is today. So this next phase is with a limited distribution network and that just means mostly mail-order and a smaller number of distributors. But it does mean that any physician can write a prescription and any patient that has access and reimbursement can get our product. They just have to go through a channel that maybe they're not currently going through in the pharmacy channel. So it won't be a flip of the switch, as Shacey said. We'll continue to progress in that way. What's exciting, I guess, about this next phase is that it does test our scale. So we started with hundreds, a predetermined number of patients in the LMR. Now we're going to start driving prescriptions, scaling the release. And it will continue to scale until we get to the full market release. We'll continue to learn. And a lot of what we're learning today is around the pathway that patients take to get on product. If you remember, we talked about the limited market release in probably hundreds of different pathways, depending on what a user's current experience is with CGM, with MDI, tubed pumps, et cetera, that they could take a unique training pathway for each of them. So some of the things we're learning in LMR is just how to tweak that experience a little bit to maybe set better expectations with some of those patients so that when they start, they know exactly what to expect with Omnipod 5. And we'll continue to learn, but we're right on track to what we said we would do, which is sometime between 3 and 9 months. We're 3 months in now. And we're excited about this next phase. But the next phase really is after this one really is full market release, and we'll just progress until we get there, which is a retail launch. Sure. Jeff, we're doing a lot of work now to prepare for the launch of Omnipod 5 outside the U.S. And contrasting it to our DASH launch, if you remember when we got approval for DASH, it was pretty quickly that we rolled out to all of our markets internationally and very quickly got to almost 100% of all new starts on DASH. The difference with Omnipod 5 is probably twofold. One, there's infrastructure with the cloud that's going to be unique by country depending on data privacy and different requirements. The other thing is reimbursement. So the reimbursement pathway for each country is different frankly because this is a new category of product where DASH was simply the same category as our legacy product. So there's different reimbursement pathways, different infrastructure to consider. And so you'll probably see more of a staged launch by country outside the U.S. once we do get clearance. Yes. Steven, I can comment probably on the first part and pass it over to Wayde for any color on guidance. But yes, we're really pleased with how the international markets are performing. Of course, there's a ton of optimism and excitement for Omnipod 5. And it's why we are excited to be under CE mark review, and we're working ambitiously to get it to market. Just like the U.S., we know it will make a difference in new starts, in demand and that there's this desire to have the best form factor paired with an AID system. So of course, there's tons of interest outside the U.S. We're trying to manage that with our current base and expectations with our partners over there, but that's why the work is so important that we get it to market, and we're excited about the CE mark. And again, we'll plan accordingly, but we'll phase the launch depending on the readiness of each market, considering the size and opportunity. And we're so excited to get there. And maybe, Wayde, you can talk a little bit about what that means. Yes. Danielle, we spent a lot of time thinking about primary care because as we desire to penetrate the type 2 market, in particular, more vigorously that many of them do reside with primary care. So today, we're getting leads in primary care mainly through our DTC campaigns. We get a lot of patients to see their physician. And so we're sort of reactive for the most part with primary care because we're waiting for a patient to become a lead and then we're reaching out to that particular primary care doc and getting them started on Omnipod DASH. But we also do call on a very small number of primary care physicians, but mainly those that sort of operate like an endocrinologist and write a lot of insulin prescriptions, for instance. We get good information from IQVIA. We know who they are. But we do want to expand more into that segment. I think a couple of things are the challenge with primary care that we have to solve for. One is just their willingness to tackle complexity. And they see pump therapy, in general, has been more complex than something they typically do today. So we have to solve for that. Virtual training is the way we can do that. The simpler we make the product, the easier it is to onboard the pharmacy channel, low co-pays. All those things we're doing will help, for sure. The other thing is just breadth. There's over 200,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. We obviously will have a sales force to tackle that. So we'll look to penetrate primary care in the future through more direct-to-consumer, more digital marketing and then ultimately better solutions and products that more succinctly fit the type 2 segment. But there's a lot of work to do there. Most of the success we're having with type 2 today is within the endocrinology segment, but we know the opportunity is massive and we do get a lot of leads from direct-to-consumer. Jayson, it's Bret. I can give a little bit of color around that. So yes, any physician can write a prescription. You're right. And any patient that has access to the product, they just can't, for instance, pick up a prescription and walk down the street to their Walgreens or CVS and expect to get Omnipod at that retail location for now. There's a couple of reasons why we would do this and use this limited distributor network for the LMR and the expanded phase of the LMR. One, as you know, we just get better visibility to who's starting. Once you start to ship product to the retail channel, it's out there. And so we don't have as much visibility and that doesn't help us with our goal of really monitoring people that are coming on, monitoring their experience and having the ability to quickly reach out to them if necessary. So this keeps us closer to the patient. It keeps us closer to the process. We get more feedback on their onboarding pathway. And it just gets us more comfortable with finally shipping product to the retail channel, which is, again, how we'll define full market release. So it's a good step. We think it does broadly open up access. But at the same time, helps us meet our goals of measuring and monitoring as we expand to the retail launch."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 results, and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. . Also on our website is our fourth quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted growth and operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With our strong Q4 2023 results, we kept off another transformational year, in which we firmly established Insulet as the market leader in automated insulin delivery. In 2023, we realized a 30% revenue growth, which marked our eighth consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth and represented dollar growth of almost $400 million. We accomplished this while also significantly expanding margins and generating positive free cash flow. Our record new customer starts in 2023, fueled our global growth and our Omnipod 5 AID system, which generated $1 billion in revenue in 2023 is transforming diabetes management. We entered 2024 with significant momentum, and we are looking forward to a year of many growth catalysts ahead. On today's call, I want to do three things: first, discuss our financial results and market traction. Next, I'll provide an update on the continuing progress of our clinical efforts and then review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our fourth quarter revenue once again exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 35%, including U.S. growth of 43%. Part of our outperformance was driven by U.S. distributors placing additional orders near the end of the quarter, which we had not factored into our guidance. We'll provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Yet even without these additional orders, we closed out 2023 ahead of our expectations, including healthy margin expansion. These are remarkable results, and I want to thank our global team for their execution and dedication. We are proud of the incredible impact the Omnipod product platform is having on people with diabetes. We recently achieved milestones of roughly 425,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, which represents growth of approximately 25% from this time last year. This also includes almost 250,000 customers on Omnipod 5, which has proven to be revolutionary. And Omnipod DASH continues to drive strong new customer starts in our U.S. type 2 diabetes market as well as in most of our international markets. We are thrilled that our unique technology is making a meaningful impact on the diabetes community, advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA cleared, fully disposable pod-based AID system. This makes our product unique and clearly differentiated from competitors' offers. These product attributes underpin our competitive advantages and are key to fueling our growth, further establishing our leadership position and expertise in the diabetes market. The fully on-body wearable AID experience of Omnipod 5 dramatically reduces the daily burden of living with diabetes. And its simplicity, ease of use and broad and affordable access are also key drivers of its rapid adoption. For almost a decade, we have significantly invested in U.S. pharmacy channel access, including building the infrastructure, developing key pharmacy relationships, creating an easy onboarding pathway and building deep in-house expertise, all of which has resulted in a strong and leading channel access we have today. We continue to strengthen Omnipod's access and affordability, including our innovation pipeline that will go through this channel by building on our advantages. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, customer retention remains strong. The mix of U.S. new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps continued at an estimated 80-20 percentage split. Today, even with improved technology, most people using insulin still use MDI as their mode of care. More than 60% of people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. are on MDI and the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes are using daily injections. Therefore, bringing people out of MDI and on to Omnipod remains the largest opportunity for us, and we continue to drive pump penetration and share gain in both the type 1 and type 2 markets, strengthening our leadership position. Omnipod 5 not only drove our number one position for U.S. and customer starts in 2023, it was the most prescribed AID system in the U.S. This is because a growing number of health care providers are writing scripts for it. In Q4, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 18,500, up from 17,000 in Q3. We speak with many HCPs and it is clear that Omnipod 5 is the winning choice for AIB. It is extremely gratifying to see the growing demand, confidence and adoption which have led to a growing number of scripts HCPs now write for our system. Our strong new customer starts included continuing adoption of Omnipod in the U.S., type 2 diabetes market. We estimate that no more than 5% of people with type 2 diabetes who need intensive insulin therapy are currently using any kind of pump. And we know that we are already the market leader in that space. We are confident that Omnipod will prove to be a simple and compelling solution for the millions of people globally with type 2 diabetes who today need insulin therapy as a part of their diabetes care regimen as well as the future millions who will naturally progress to requiring insulin as a part of their care. We are well positioned to bring all of the benefits of the Omnipod platform with people with type 2 diabetes both today and in the future. In the fourth quarter, type 2 diabetes patients represented between 20% and 25% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod suite of products. While Omnipod DASH, with its type 2 indication for use is the leading insulin pump operating in this market, we look forward to marketing Omnipod 5 to type 2 patients once we have an expanded indication. The underlying demand is apparent. We expect the last participant to complete our type 2 pivotal trial in the coming weeks, and we plan to submit results to the FDA by the end of 2024 for an expanded indication. We are confident this will be another catalyst that will fuel our growth trajectory, allow us to serve more patients and help us deliver on our mission. We look forward to sharing study results at ADA this June. The success of Omnipod 5, including its early yet powerful impact in 2 of our European markets, led to another strong quarter of new customer starts globally. Internationally, we realized a notable sequential increase in new customer starts, driven by the impact of Omnipod 5 that's having in the U.K. and Germany. Our early success in these countries supports our confidence that it will continue to transform diabetes care and position us as a market leader everywhere Omnipod 5 is available. We remain on track with our Omnipod 5 plus G6 European launch plans with the aim of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers by the end of 2024. We are also thrilled to begin our journey launching Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott\u2019s Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor. I'll speak to this new opportunity in a moment. In addition to our type 2 pivotal study progress, we are meaningfully advancing several other clinical initiatives. We are excited to attend the ATTD International Conference in Italy in a couple of weeks where we will present data for the Omnipod 5 plus G6 randomized controlled trial. This RCT compared Omnipod 5 to non-AID pump and included study sites in the U.S. and France. We are thrilled to have recently published in the Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics Journal real-world evidence from almost 70,000 people with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating Omnipod 5's effectiveness in a large, diverse population. The data are impressive and demonstrate the strength of the Omnipod 5 algorithm in the real world delivering leading time in range and very low hypoglycemia, reinforcing Omnipod 5 as the obvious choice for clinical outcomes and personalized diabetes care. Central to everything we do is our mission to simplify life for people with diabetes. We want to make it easier for people to get prescribed therapy, get set up on therapy and use therapy consistently over time. This is the point of our evolution feasibility study taking place in New Zealand. Our intent is to have a next-generation algorithm that will further drive simplicity of use. We completed the first feasibility study in participants with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, commencing initially in supervised hotel setting and then progressing to at-home use. We are pleased with the preliminary results and are analyzing the data and making modifications for the next round of subjects. We will present early feasibility results at ATTD. Lastly, we continue to actively enroll participants in our RADIANT study in France, the U.K. and Belgium, which is our Libre 2 integration trial. We began enrollment in September 2023, which is now halfway complete. Feedback has been tremendous and physicians new to Omnipod 5 appreciate its simplicity and potential to reach many more pump-naive users. As a reminder, both our G6 and Libre 2 studies are designed to provide the evidence we need to elevate Omnipod 5 status as superior first-line therapy and help drive our pricing and market access initiatives as we further roll out Omnipod 5 with multiple sensors across our international markets. I'll now provide an update on our innovation progress and we'll focus on three key areas: expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod Go and building our digital and data capabilities. Many of you have heard us say that our current Omnipod 5 system is our \"minimum\" viable product. That's easy to forget given how quickly the market has adopted Omnipod 5 and made it the leading offer. Our current version is on only one operating system, Android. It is integrated with only one continuous glucose monitoring partner, Dexcom and until recently, was commercialized with only G6, and it contains our first-generation algorithm. This is about to change with platform extensions that will strengthen our leadership, deepen our competitive moats and allow us to open up Omnipod 5 to many more customers. To start, we are excited to have commenced our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 over the last 2 weeks. This initial release will allow us time to test the market and build product at scale to prepare for what we are confident will be a very successful full market release of G7 this year. We anticipate an acceleration in new customer starts following a full launch, which will help to fuel our revenue growth more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond. We are also on track with our planned limited market release of Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 Plus in the first half of this year in the Netherlands and U.K. made possible by the CE Mark approval we received earlier this month. We are excited that the option for customers to use Omnipod 5 with both G6 and Libre 2 Plus will enable us to reach many more patients. Our recent and upcoming CGM integrations are important milestones in providing choice to tens of thousands of customers who want to use Omnipod 5 and we believe both integrations will be a significant catalyst for our growth in 2024 and beyond. Rounding out near-term innovation, we are planning for our U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 with the G6 system with our iOS app this year. This will mark a major innovation milestone because so many of our U.S. customers use Apple iPhone and prefer to carry only one phone. Another innovation that will allow us to reach more people and further expand our total addressable market is Omnipod GO, a solution designed for individuals with type 2 who naturally progress to requiring basal-only insulin and want a simple way to receive their daily dose, while avoiding the burden of injections. Our commercial pilot is underway, and it will help us refine our commercialization plans. Omnipod DASH has already made Insulet the leader in insulin delivery for people with type 2 diabetes. And with Omnipon GO, we are well positioned to move upstream in the patient care pathway. When we achieve clearance for Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market, we will bring all of the advantages of our AID system to this market. With these 3 products, our aim is to deliver an Omnipod portfolio that meets the full range of needs of people with type 2 who require insulin as a part of their care. We are excited about our innovation in the space and our ability to address the unmet needs that exist in this patient population. It is a massive global market that we expect will continue to grow, and we have the clear lead to pursue this market opportunity. We are also excited to build on our digital and data capabilities. One of the breakthrough features of Omnipod 5 is the real-time data provided by SIM cards in every controller. We constantly hear from physicians and patients how much they appreciate not needing to plug in for real-time usage data and 100% cloud connectivity has already given us the opportunity to publish the largest, real-world data set on AID. Over time, we plan to use the data to speed our product development, further improve the user experience, streamline physician workflows and build on our competitive advantages. We also continue building digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. In closing, Insulet continues to set the standard for the industry. With a strong 2023 behind us, we see multiple catalysts in the coming year and beyond. We are confident we will drive significant growth and continued success. I want to thank our Insulet global team for your dedication and deep passion for our customers and your commitment to delivering innovation. You are the reason for our success and our ability to continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren.\nLauren Budden: Thanks, Jim. 2023 was another exciting year for Insulet, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We have strong momentum with many catalysts that will drive revenue growth and margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term. In Q4, we generated strong global, new customer starts fueled by the continued high demand for Omnipod 5, not only in the U.S. but also in our first 2 European markets. . As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 37% revenue growth in Q4, driven by global Omnipod growth of over 35%. We benefited from a shift in order timing and an increase in days on hand at certain pharmacy distributors, which I'll speak to in a moment. Without these benefits, our results still exceeded these guidance ranges. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 130 basis point tailwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 43%, which continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and the related premium for pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a benefit for the many reasons Jim spoke to, and our efforts to drive increased volume through this channel have resulted in almost all of our U.S. volume going through the pharmacy channel. The recurring net volume benefit we recognized in Q4 from new customers who received their starter kits and first refill orders was in line with our expectations and remain consistent with Q3 levels. We expect this trend to continue. Also as expected, the same net volume benefit from existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 was immaterial since the vast majority had already previously converted. In Q4, U.S. revenue benefited from 2 dynamics not previously contemplated in our guidance. First, our largest U.S. pharmacy wholesalers collectively placed an estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated from the first quarter of 2024 in advance of our implementation of a new ERP system at the start of 2024. The second benefit was an increase in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $10 million to $15 million as pharmacy distributors returned to their normal levels. As a reminder, in the first half of 2023, we called out a reduction in inventory days on hand below normal levels. What this boils down to is approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in Q4 that we had not anticipated, contributing approximately 12 points to our U.S. revenue growth. We are proud of our fourth quarter U.S. performance, especially given the tougher comparison due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of 2022. Additionally, new customer starts in Q4 were slightly down from Q3 as expected as the market is moving from Dexcom's G6 sensor to G7. We are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. And as Jim shared, we expect new customer starts to accelerate throughout 2024 as we ramp our commercial efforts. Overall, our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5's success and continued robust demand. International Omnipod revenue increased 12.5%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree, a benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, both of which drove notable increases in new customer starts. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 550 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 250 points favorable versus our guide. In Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remained stable. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, representing a $5.5 million increase, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 70.9%, up over 1,200 basis points. Excluding the impact of the 2022 medical device corrections, adjusted gross margin increased 620 basis points to 70.7% in Q4 2023. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and product mix. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable mix that included a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. Partially offsetting the favorable contributors were expected higher production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses increased in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory, including gearing up for near-term product launches globally. Adjusted operating margin was 20.7% and adjusted EBITDA was 26.9% of revenue. Both were above our expectations, primarily due to the $30 million to $40 million revenue benefit I mentioned, which had an estimated 360 basis point favorable impact on adjusted operating margin. To a lesser extent, both outperformed due to our higher-than-expected gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $700 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. At the end of January, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B at a lower interest rate, which will reduce interest expense on an annualized basis by almost $2 million. We also achieved the milestone during the year of turning free cash flow positive, generating approximately $70 million in 2023. We continue to strengthen our financial position, giving us the flexibility to invest throughout our organization to drive long-term sustainable growth while at the same time expanding our margins and generating positive free cash flow. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. We continue to expect another year of large dollar growth even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023, most notably from our Omnipod 5 ramp. We expect to approach total company revenue of $2 billion at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 18% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 17%. As a reminder, our total company growth expectations exclude approximately 3 points due to the estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 21% driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in 2024, resulting from the significant 2 scripts and retail channel net stocking volume benefits in 2023. In addition, our expectations exclude approximately 4 points of growth due to the estimated orders that shifted into 2023. When factoring this into both periods, our normalized expectation for 2024 at the high end of our range is in line with the color we provided on our third quarter call of mid-20% growth. We anticipate new customer starts in the first half of 2024 to be slightly lower than the levels we had in the second half of 2023 due to normal seasonality trends, and we expect an acceleration in the second half of 2024 following a full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. Also, as a reminder, estimated revenue from Omnipod 5 with our iOS app and from Omnipod GO is expected to be immaterial. We also currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more towards the second half of 2024 due to the timing of new customer starts, partially offset by the Q4 2023 stocking benefit. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 10%, which is in line with the 2024 color we previously provided of high single digits. On a reported basis, we are assuming no foreign currency impact. We expect growth to be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. We are excited to enter our first European markets in the first half of 2024, with Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in another market around the same time. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect these launches to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in 2025. We continue to expect the first half of the year to be in the high single digits range and to accelerate in the second half of the year to a range of high single digits to low double digits, primarily due to a more meaningful contribution from our Omnipod 5 U.K. and Germany launches and, to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect a 50% to 60% decline in line with the 2024 color we previously provided. Turning to 2024 gross margin. We expect a range of 68% to 69% and anticipated benefit from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are higher costs associated with our new product launches. We expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half due to accelerating revenue throughout the year and continued manufacturing efficiencies. In 2024, we plan to expand both gross and operating margins while driving market growth. We expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D and clinical and expand our sales force and other functions to support our commercial efforts and growth initiatives, including our near-term product lines. Our sales force expansion includes hiring some reps specifically focused on pediatrics, a population for which Omnipod has always captured a large share. Even with increased investments, we have many opportunities to significantly expand margins and increase shareholder value, and we remain committed to doing just that. We expect operating margin to be approximately 13%, up approximately 100 basis points from 2023 adjusted operating margin. When factoring in the 130 basis point year-over-year unfavorable impact in 2024 from the $20 million to $25 million shift in order timing, we expect operating margins to be approximately 200 basis points higher in 2024 over 2023. We expect operating margin to significantly improve in the second half of the year over the first half due to revenue ramping during the year and continued manufacturing improvements. We have many catalysts for growth in 2024 and considerable opportunities to drive further margin expansion over the near and long term coming from scaling the business efficiently even with the continued focused investments in our robust innovation pipeline and commercial efforts. We expect capital expenditures to almost double from 2023 due to the timing of spend to support our planned 2024 production at our new Malaysia manufacturing facility as well as investments to support continuous improvement efforts in our other manufacturing locations and to a lesser degree, investment in IT infrastructure. Turning to our first quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 15% to 18% and total company growth of 17% to 20%. Our total company revenue expectations exclude approximately 6 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 19% to 22%, which excludes over 8 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $5 million to $6 million. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter and year of significant financial performance and strategic execution. We have strong momentum at the start of 2024 with many catalysts ahead and as a result, we are in a fantastic position to continue to grow and efficiently scale our business. The global market opportunities for Insulet are tremendous, and we will continue to invest in innovation with an increased commitment to significant margin expansion. We are well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and to deliver on our mission for our customers. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I wanted to ask about the guidance on U.S. growth. If you just do the math using year-over-year growth rates, you get 2% from stocking which implies like 18% to 23% versus kind of the mid-20s guide before. But I know you said in the script like there was really no change to guidance. And I guess if you just do it on dollars, you kind of get to the same place. Maybe you can just provide some clarification on the U.S. guide and how it's changed versus 3 months ago.\nLauren Budden: So yes, just in November when we gave guidance, it really hasn't changed much in our view. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a $30 million to $40 million shift in revenue -- or sorry, incremental revenue. Of that $10 million to $15 million was an increase in days on hand inventory levels. And so that, we have seen the inventory levels brought down earlier in the first half of the year. So that was a piece of that. The rest of it, the $20 million to $25 million was the shift that we saw in order timing from Q1 to Q4. So for that, that was in advance of our ERP. And if you were to normalize for that, which contributed about 12 points benefit to our U.S. revenue growth rate, we really achieved the high end of our guidance range there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRohin Patel: This is actually Rohin on for Robbie. You came off a really great year on both the top and bottom lines with continued health and new patient growth in the U.S. as well. I was wondering, if you could elaborate more on some of the key growth drivers to new patient growth as well as margin expansion in 2024 and beyond.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Rohin. I'll take the first shot at that, but then I'm sure Lauren may want to comment as well. I mean I think that the main -- there's just a core driver to new customer starts for us, which is Omnipod 5 is clearly the most preferred product in the market. We lead in new customer starts. Wherever we take Omnipod 5, we lead in new customer starts for people coming up with MDI, and we continue to take a lot of competitor share. So the Omnipod 5 offering as it exists today is already an underlying growth driver for us. Then there are a number of things that we'll bring to market in 2024 that will drive a lot of growth. We'll be able to drive international expansion for Omnipod 5 in 2024 as we said. We're aiming to get into the G6 product to market into the Netherlands along with sensor of choice in U.K., Netherlands in the first half. And as we've said, by the end of 2024, we expect to have Omnipod 5 available to the majority of our customers in our European markets. And then obviously, G7. So we're really excited to have been able to accelerate our G7 LMR by a couple of weeks, a little bit earlier than our expectation. We've been in market now with the LMR for not quite 3 weeks, about 2.5 weeks and aim to bring a full market release of G7 during the year, which we think will continue to drive new customer starts for us. So we're very, very excited about that. So there's a lot of catalysts coming in our innovation pipeline that will drive growth on top of the already existing leading market position for Omnipod 5. But I'm sure, Lauren, will want to pick up on -- at least I'm guessing, Lauren, you want to pick up on some of which you asked her as well.\nLauren Budden: So yes, we have a lot of additional opportunities for improvement, especially if we exceed our revenue targets and you saw that in Q4, we had tremendous operating margin. It was over 20% on an adjusted basis. And if you normalize for the revenue shift, it was about 17%. So if we can exceed revenue, we can have a lot of incremental margin opportunity. But keep in mind that we will be balancing that with investment. So as Jim mentioned, we have a lot of new product launches coming up, and we want to make sure we're executing on our strategic imperatives to drive future growth in 2025 and beyond. So we will be balancing that with the revenue drop through to the bottom line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Jim, you're encouraging to hear that O5 in the majority of the EU markets by the end of 2024. That's the good thing. I didn't hear anything on G7 integration with O5 in Europe. In 2024. I know you are specifically not providing that, but any color you can provide there, especially in the context of talking about your U.S. growth accelerating in 2024, just as the market is starting to move to G7 and you need to get that FMR on G7 out there in the U.S. to then take advantage of that move to G7 that Dexcom has seen. So I guess, it sounds like that lack of G7 integration could be a headwind in '24 offset by the O5 expanding in EU. So just how do we think about those 2 disparate factors, if you will?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and nice to hear from you. So one way to think about this is that we're prioritizing the sequencing, right? And so we know that driving the integration with sensors and driving sensor of choice as we call it for customers is really, really important. And you can see -- in a way, you can see what we're doing here because we're already into LMR with G7 in the U.S. We're going to learn a lot about that integration here. We feel very comfortable with it as it has been through [indiscernible]. But you put the LMR out in the market to see the product in the wild, right, and make sure you're happy with it, make sure customers are having a great experience. And we'll learn from that LMR in a way that will allow us to accelerate G7 in the U.S. and then internationally. We haven't guided the timing on anything outside of the US on G7 but the LMR is important in that way. Very similarly, we're looking to be able to accelerate our LMR for the Libre 2 Plus integration in Europe and working hard to get that to market. The experience we're having right now with the RADIANT trial, which is our Libre integration trial in Europe suggest that that's a great wear experience for customers as well. And so you can see we're accelerating that LMR in Europe. We'll learn from that LMR too. So -- and we haven't given any timing guidance on Libre for the U.S., but you can see what we're doing is we're kind of parallel processing the 2 LMRs to maximize our learning and kind of optimize our resource use across the geographies, if that makes sense. Very high priority for us to get sensor integrations up and running to give choice and also because what we want to do is we're really prioritizing making sure that customers that want to be on Omnipod 5 can get on Omnipod 5. And that's our top priorities to drive this. It's really -- it's proven on -- Omnipod 5 has proven to be a revolutionary offer. Lots of people want to be on Omnipod 5. So we're working hard to make sure we get the sensors integrated as quickly as we can into the various geographies as quickly as we can to provide that kind of access and option to customers and working hard to optimize the way we're doing it, so we can maximize our learning in time to market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Just on international, is your expectation that you'll be able to capture price with OP5? And then kind of what is the gating factor here in not launching into -- and launching into new European geographies a little quicker than fully by year-end.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes, Jason, great question. It has been -- we've talked about this consistently in the past. So what we want to do with Omnipod 5 is generate the evidence we need, which is we're doing with our G6 RCT, which I mentioned in the comments we're doing with our RADIANT trial. We're generating the evidence we need to establish Omnipod 5 as a first-line offering and then go and negotiate for reimbursement across our international markets. Reimbursement levels that are commensurate with the extra value we're creating with the Omnipod 5 offering. And so our goal is to drive a price premium. It's a little bit different from what we did in the U.S. because when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S., we launched it into the pharmacy channel, pricing parity with DASH because we knew that would streamline time to full coverage in the market. So we got to full coverage. In the European markets, what we need to do is make sure we're negotiating kind of reimbursement body. It's different in every market, and there's tenders, there's ministries of health and so on, but we need to negotiate those market by market, but we have to generate the evidence that's required to be able to have that conversation. So far, we've been very successful with that. So working in the U.K., we're very comfortable with where we've landed with reimbursement levels in the U.K., working in Germany and so on. And so we're going to continue to drive that and work really hard to achieve a premium for Omnipod 5 everywhere we launch it. And then remind me the second part of your question, it was all the gating factors. Gating factors, it's a little bit different by every market. Sometimes it's reimbursement -- sometimes it's sort of cloud connectivity. We've made a lot of progress on that latter technical front. And then it's just preparing for commercial launch and making sure that everything is lined up to do that. We're making terrific progress. And as we've said, I just want to clarify, actually, I think Jeff just said that we said we'd be in the majority of our markets. We haven't said that. What we've said is that by the end of 2024, there may be a technical problem on the call. What we said by the end of 2024, we will have the majority of our European customers have Omnipod 5 available.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: I wanted to follow-up on Travis' question on the guide. So I guess the crux, Lauren, of my question is, did anything change from the Q3 call and from JPMorgan. So you said the high end -- when you make these adjustments, you said the high end of this guidance implies mid-20s. So why the high end? I mean is there -- was there an incremental change? And I think you said at JPMorgan that new starts would grow year-over-year in 2024. I didn't hear that in your comments today. And I'm just curious, Lauren, your guidance philosophy in general, has anything changed from historically Insulet is guided pretty conservatively.\nJim Hollingshead: Larry, we're having a technical problem on the call. And so I'm going to take my best shot at answering your question. And so on guidance, nothing has really changed from our guidance. I think that the guide we've given on revenue and on new customer starts, I mean, it's pretty consistent with the color we gave on the November call. And the big move is actually the unusual order pattern where we had $20 million to $25 million of revenue pulled forward. We're still guiding to ramping new customer starts in 2024. The change -- the only real change in the guidance that we're giving compared to color is that we're guiding to a 13% -- roughly a 13% operating margin for 2024, which is actually an increase from the color we gave on the November call. And there are a number of opportunities for us to do that. But we delivered really strong operating income through 2023 and actually exceeded what we had guided to for 2023 because if you remember our guide in 2023, it was high-single-digits, which you call it like 9.5% plus, and we ended up delivering well above that. And we're now guiding to 13%, which as Lauren explained in the prepared comments, represents 100 basis points over what we achieved at the end of 2023, but more than 200 basis points or roughly 200 basis points above what we would have achieved without the revenue pull forward. That 13% OI guide, is the only real change from the color we gave in November, if that makes sense.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: Wanted to maybe follow up on HCP prescribers. Obviously, that's a number that continues to grow quarter on quarter on quarter. Curious if you can provide any details around that? Are these folks routinely prescribing? Are you seeing growth in number of prescriptions? Maybe how does this compare to the number of pump prescribers in the U.S. And sorry, it's a long-winded question, but it really gets at this concept of how can you open up the part of the intensive insulin patient population, type 1 or type 2 that is being seen outside of the Endo's office and really scale that effort.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Margaret. It's a great question. And again, I'll start and if Lauren wants to chime in on the back, I'd welcome that. Just to go back to context, we actually didn't put this in the prepared comments this quarter, but we've -- in the past, we've pointed out the endo market is somewhere around 70 -- 7,000 to 7,500 endos in the U.S. We know that a number of prescribers that we have are either endocrinologists themselves or their so-called physician extenders, which will include nurse practitioners and physician assistance, but we're clearly getting prescriptions beyond that. We're clearly getting prescription writing outside of endo practices, in PCP practices and in smaller practices, and that dynamic continues to grow, and we can see it in our own data. We don't have perfect insight into it out of the various available data. But we can see we're reaching more and more health care practitioners. And that's we believe we're doing that through word of mouth, through our promotion activities, which include both direct-to-patient activities and also direct-to-physician promotional activities online. And then the other thing I'll say is that it's been very, very powerful for us, sort of along the same lines. The Omnipod GO commercial pilot has proven to be a terrific investment for us this year because what we're learning -- we're learning a lot more about what happens in the primary care channel for people living with diabetes. And just a couple of things we're seeing, we've learned a lot about the target patient population for Omnipod, we've learned that primary care practices when they think pump, they think the [indiscernible] thing with a tube that they would never prescribe and then when they see Omnipod, there's a little bit of a head dynamic, and they say, \"Wait, you know what, that's so easy. My patients could do that. We could do that.\" And so we're very confident we're going to be able to drive demand for the Omnipod platform across primary care. And I think we're seeing more type 1 patients than we anticipated in the primary care channel. So to your point, we're very optimistic that as we continue to drive learnings out of our Omnipod Go pilot, we're going to be able to find a new kind of new avenues for driving demand for Omnipod and really driving pod therapy -- Omnipod therapy into the world where patients need it most. And so we're very optimistic about that. And so we continue to see that trend as a positive signal for us, but we're really excited about what we're learning out in the world with our commercial pilot as we go.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: I was just hoping to better understand pricing dynamics through the pharmacy channel in the U.S. for Omnipod 5 and DASH. Was reimbursement stable that Insulet was receiving for Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH in \u201823? And how should we factor in reimbursement levels and pricing for Omnipod 5 and DASH in 2024?\nLauren Budden: Yes. So really, it's more about a volume business at this point. We did get a big price lift throughout 2023 from the conversions into the pharmacy channel. But as we've mentioned previously, those conversions are largely complete by this point. So we're not seeing that going forward. We did have a price increase like we normally do in early September, which was pretty minimal. It's just under 3% kind of in line with the cost of living adjustment. So just keep in mind there, though, we don't see the full benefit of that because some of it goes to the DDM in terms of rebates and to the wholesaler fees. So at this point, for 2024, I would pretty much say that you should focus on the volume, not the price has leveled off. The great news is that we are getting that continued price lift going forward, but it shouldn't be an incremental change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst : This is Anthony on for Joanne. 2024 is kind of investment year, maybe 2025 as well. But can you talk over the longer term, 2026 and beyond where gross margins and operating margins potentially could go and how you get there?\nLauren Budden: Yes, I'm happy to start off and then Jim feel free to add on. Yes, we definitely feel like we have room for expansion, both on margin and gross margin in the near term and in the longer term. We did great in Q4, and we have lots of opportunities as we're setting up with the product launches that we have this year that will accelerate the top line and be able to allow us to drop more through. We haven't put out guidance beyond 2024, but we are planning on doing a long-range plan later in this year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: It is going to be one question, I promise. The first part is just more clarification kind of to Larry's question earlier, but I'm looking at the stock down kind of mid- to upper single digits in the aftermarket. I think it's on this guidance commentary. And again, the high end of the range gets you to that 25%. Was it a street modeling issue at 25% versus where it should have been 23%, 24%. I'm just making sure there's nothing competitively or pharmacy related that we should really be worried about? And then the real question is, Jim, when you guys came out with O 5, I think you went from 80/20 MDI to competitive conversions all the way to 60-40, and then it went to 70-30, now we're back to 80-20. Is it getting tougher and tougher to take those competitive conversions? And with G7, do you think that will start to get a little bit better, a little bit easier throughout the course of this year?\nJim Hollingshead: Why don't -- we'll have Lauren start on the guide and then I'll pick up on the competition. Go ahead, Lauren.\nLauren Budden: Sure. So for 2024, even with the significant volume benefit that we realized in '23, we're guarding to very strong revenue growth. We expect to achieve almost $2 billion in revenue and our guide represents $300 million of revenue growth in terms of dollars. So your question in terms of what changed from the call we provided, it was really just that revenue shift of 20 million to 25 million of orders that were -- would have been Q1 but were placed in advance of our ERP implementation. So the estimated impact of that is 3 points on the total company and 4 points on U.S. Omnipod. So overall, our guide is strong. And as we've mentioned, we have many catalysts for growth in '24 that's going to help accelerate it and particularly in the back half with those new customer starts and provide strong revenue growth for the year and into 2025 and beyond.\nDeborah Gordon: I'm sorry, Jim. I was just going to say that, you nailed it. I thought I heard you say that U.S. The Street is modeling now 25% on a normalized basis. So if I got that right that you said that the U.S., that's exactly right for the year on a normalized basis. And Lauren nailed it when she said the 4-point impact. So when Lauren provided some color on the Q3 call that we would be in mid-20s to referring to 24 to 26 around there. And at the midpoint, we're spot on what we were expecting for U.S. And that's about -- if you do the math, about 21% on a normalized basis for total Omnipod and it gets you to the total company growth of 20%. So it's spot on from the color that Lauren gave in November. We just didn't expect that shift, which is the $20 million to $30 million shift that happens, ends up or $20 million to $25 million ends up being double, right, to the 40 to 50 because it's comes out of one year and goes into the other. So that's where actually she was trying to normal set. So hopefully, that answers your question on that piece. Sorry, Jim\nJim Hollingshead: And we can always clarify this offline, right? So -- but it's a decrease in the denominator, increase in the numerator for '24, you get the normalized number, right? So it's a double whammy in that $20 million to $25 million. So the underlying guide remains the same, respectively. On the competition, yes, we continue to have really good new customer starts. And historically, we always had 80/20 of MDI and competitive switching. After the launch of Omnipod 5, we obviously caught a lot of competitive switchers, and we've done really, really well. We continue to have. So if you think about pre-Omnipod-5 and that 20% of competitive switches and with Omnipod 5 and 20% of competitive switchers, it's a larger number than it was, right? So because new customer starts are up overall, so we continue to do very, very well. And the underlying dynamic there is we also retain the vast majority of customers that we get from competitors. Retention is very, very strong. And we said that, we do think -- we had the benefit now of hearing our two competitors' calls, and we have the benefit of seeing what's happening out in the market. We don't see -- there's little things around the edges, I would say. We don't see any fundamental underlying shift in the competitive dynamic. Omnipod 5 continues to be the preferred product. But I would say that one of our competitors has done a better job of staunching the bleeding in their installed base. And so you can see a little bit of that dynamic going on in the market. But we're still clearly the preferred offer -- clearly winning with MDI and just winning with new customer starts overall very, very clearly in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners.\nMike Kratky: So you've capitalized on having a competitive advantage in type 2 with broad pharmacy access. How are you planning on defending that position in the market as we start to see additional pumps expand into the pharmacy channel on both a near-term basis and then looking ahead to 2025?\nJim Hollingshead: Great question. Thank you. Pharmacy is -- our offer -- the Omnipod platform offer is much better suited to the pharmacy channel than tubed pumps are, much, much better suited. 2 pumps at the end of the day, continue to be durable equipment. And there's all kinds of things that I can go into the weeds here and talk about this, but I'll just say it's not a surprise that we see competitors trying to figure out how to get in the pharmacy channel with a durable tube pump because we've been so successful in establishing the pharmacy channel for AID. And as we would expect, competitors are -- we've established market leadership across basically the whole range of our offer and competitors are going to chase that. It's -- there's -- what we've learned is, there's a very big learning curve in pharmacy. It's very, very different from the DME channel, the economics work better for us because there's -- in all cases, the value is actually in the pump, whether it's a durable pump or it's the pod. And the fact that the value is created in our consumable, which is the pod gives us an inherent advantage as we -- it starts to get a little abstract, but it gives us an inherent advantage as we're in that channel. Couple that with the fact that we have very, very wide coverage in the pharmacy channel, we have established contracts across the PBMs. And we've had very successful growth with all of our PBM partners. We think we have a very defensible position there. People who use insulin go into the pharmacy to get their insulin, whether they're getting it from retail pharmacy. So it's a great place for them to also get their AID-pump therapy and Omnipod continues to be very uniquely positioned and the value prop of Omnipod in the pharmacy channel will continue to be very uniquely positioned as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Jim, your comments on what you've learned so far from the GO LMR were really interesting. It sounds like that's going pretty well. But I think I heard the guidance really doesn't assume any benefit from GO in '24, which makes it sound like a full launch isn't planned anytime soon. How are you thinking about the timing for a full launch? And what's really the gating factor there? What boxes do you need to check before you're ready to expand the commercialization?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes, great question. The way to think about Omnipod GO is that we hear a different language about this. And I'd just be really clear, we're not in limited market release with GO, we're in a commercial pilot, right? And so that's a step before -- I think I said this last quarter on our call as well, that's a step before an LMR. The product itself is ready. It's out on patients, it's fully approved. We continue to grow coverage for it. So that's a step but we're ahead of schedule and coverage. So the way to think about the Omnipod GO commercial pilot is the gating factor is not timing, it's learning, right? So what we're using it for is to establish the right commercial model, both for GO and for the primary care chain. And one of the reasons we're so excited about the pilot is that we are learning an awful lot out of that pilot. And so -- and where we're going to land on this thing, whether we commercialize in '24 with GO or commercialize -- get to more of an FMR in '24 or sometime in '25, where we're going to land is we're going to be in the primary care channel first and second, one way or another, we're going to have call points in primary care. And the other thing is we will have the broadest offering for people living with type 2 diabetes who need insulin delivery. So we're already the market leader with DASH in that space very clearly. We know -- we have our pivotal trial going to Omnipod 5. As we said before, we know Omnipod 5 is actually being used off label. In a lot of cases, we're not promoting Omnipod 5 off-label, but we'll have -- our goal is to have the label for Omnipod 5 in the short order coming out of our pivotal trial, and we continue to have a plan to file with the FDA for that label extension in '24, and we'll have Omnipod GO. And that gives you the whole coverage for people using insulin with type 2 all the way from I'm initiating basal insulin 2, I'm using intensive insulin. And so we'll have that full portfolio of products, and we'll have a very clear way to commercialize that in both primary care and in the endocrinology channel. So that's why I'd say I'm very excited about the commercial pilot with Omnipod GO. We are learning the ton and it's going to make us much better commercially as we get into that and get that full portfolio on market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman: As you start opening up the opportunity here to the Libre platform outside the U.S. and then in the U.S., can you give us your latest thoughts on the size of that opportunity. There's been estimates on what that new opportunity set looks like. It would be great to get your latest color on that.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. We think it's a really big opportunity. If you look at the sensor market, you've got millions of people using Dexcom sensors and millions of people using Abbott's sensors. So the G6, G7 family products and the Libre 2 and Libre -- now emerging Libre 3 family products by creating the integration across that range. So prioritizing G7, prioritizing Libre 2 plus and then 3 that we're working in parallel. It opens up a really large substantial market for us. The two -- we love working with both of our partners. They both have great technology. They're both really good partners. Development pathway with both of them is really strong. They're slightly -- they have slightly different positions in the main geographies of the U.S. and Europe in terms of their installed base, but both of them have very large installed bases. And both of them have, as we've always said, CGM pays road for us because people get used to having an on-body experience with a sensor and it makes it much easier for them to then jump to an on-body experience with an Omnipod. And so we think it opens up -- you can go look at the market share, the estimated market share for our two partners, but we think the Libre integrations open up a large installed base both in Europe and the U.S. of people who will be ready for Omnipod because they're used to a on-body CGM experience.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG.\nSam Eiber: Sam on for Marie. Maybe I can follow up on some of the type 2 comments. And just looking at pivotal data coming up at ADA and then filing for label expansion, how much of an uplift could that be once you do get the expanded label there? Just considering 20%, 25% of new patient starts are already coming from type 2?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Sam. If you just look at the size of the end markets there, and I'll repeat numbers that we shared before. In the U.S., there are about 1.6 million people living with type 1 diabetes. And if that market is about, probably, something less than 40% penetrated with AID therapy. Then in the type 2 market, there are somewhere between 3 million and 4 million people living with type 2 who are on basal-only therapy. And somewhere around 2.5 million people living with type 2 in the U.S. who need intensive insulin therapy, so basal plus bolus. Omnipod 5 is really aimed at that intensive insulin therapy population, about 2.5 million people in the U.S. And therefore, it's a larger end market than Omnipod 5 plays in now with its current label. We know that, that market is less than 5% penetrated with AID therapy. And we are already the market leader in that segment of the market because Omnipod DASH has a label there, and we know we're the clear market leader in the space. So we're very optimistic. Omnipod 5 is very easy to use. It takes a lot of the burden off of managing your diabetes. That's why it's been so successful in the type 1 population. And we're very optimistic about that value proposition going into the intensive insulin using type 2 population, which is a larger end market than the one we're playing in today. So we think it is a really important opportunity and a market that, by the way, will continue to grow over time.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Just a question on the wholesaler stocking and that whole dynamic because it is something now we have to start thinking about in the model, But and I know it's unpredictable. But qualitatively, maybe you could talk about how much visibility you have into when that pod that gets stocked goes on to a patient. I guess trying to get a sense of is this something that's going to happen to this level every single quarter, if they're going off the shelves very quickly? How long do the stocking sort of fit on the shelf there?\nLauren Budden: No. I mean it doesn't really stay on the shelf that long. I mean we -- it's a pretty efficient channel. In terms of the visibility into the date on hand though that's not something that we ever included in our guidance, and that's something that we can't control. And so unfortunately, this quarter, we had the double whammy of them taking the inventory level back up after they had taken them down earlier in the year. And then at the same time, we had the ERP pull forward dynamic. So I don't expect that we'd see something of that magnitude. But again, when we have something like this, what we do is, we call out and we tell you when it happens, we don't have the ability to guide to it. It's not something in our control.\nOperator: And we do have time for one more question. That question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Great. So maybe a bit of a 2-parter good news and maybe challenging news question, if I could, just at the end, is -- you had mentioned that you're looking for acceleration on the back of [indiscernible] G7 integration. And I mean given the new patient share that you're catching now, I just would ask maybe what's -- it's very high growth, and it's very high share of new patients. What additional patients do you get with G7 that you're not already capturing and in the advantage that you seem to be having in the clinic? And then the other question is looking out a year, 18 months or so, not certain, of course, but it certainly seems like there's going to be, at some point, another tubeless pump on the market from one of your competitors or more. And so maybe just think about your -- how do you think about that? And how do you prepare for that? How do you look to continue your leadership in that segment? And how should we -- investors think about that if I can grow potentially.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. I'll do those in reverse order. The first one is on the tubeless form factor. We obviously watch our competitor pipelines as closely as we can. And in terms of what is out there publicly that we can see, we don't see anything coming in that time frame that's even close to what we have in market right now with Omnipod 5, just in terms of the whole package, the convenience, the ease of use, the scalability, the wear experience, automated needle insertion, we could go on and on about the feature set that we are very confident in our competitive position. We're never complacent. We have a lot of respect for our competitors, and we know that what -- because Omnipod in general, but Omnipod 5 has been so successful, everybody wants to chase it. So that just makes sense, and that's how competition works. But we are very confident in our competitive position, and we don't see anything coming in anybody's pipeline that even matches what we have, and we're going to continue to drive innovation. So we're going to extend our lead. On the first part of your question, it's a really good question. Yes. We're obviously doing very, very well in the market with our existing offer. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it's really -- we really see it as our minimum viable product, and we've done so well with it. But on specifically the G6 and G7, what you're seeing and it's -- you can go look analytically at the underlying script data, what you're seeing is G7 is really doing well with new customer starts. So a lot of people going on to G7. And you guys have heard this is probably corny but you've heard me use the metaphor before, about fishing. If you think we're out fishing in the stock pond, the pond has a lot of G6 in it, but it's got more and more G7 in it all the time. And so we want to be able to go out there and fish in both bonds and proportionally, G7 is a larger and larger part of the market. We want to -- now I'm going to mix metaphors. We want that wind at our back of all the patients coming under G7. We know the offer together, Omnipod 5 and G7 is going to be terrific and drive a lot of growth for us just like Omnipod 5 with G6 had.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We are really excited to have delivered another outstanding year for Insulet. We're focused on extending our leading position with our deep expertise and strong emphasis on innovation, operational excellence and further improving the customer experience. We remain committed to driving value for our shareholders through margin expansion and cash flow generation, all while maintaining our emphasis on investing for growth. I also want to once again thank our outstanding Insulet global team for their dedication and their focus on innovation and passion to our customers. Thank you, everybody. And with that, I'll thank you all and wish you all a great evening. Good night, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With our strong Q4 2023 results, we kept off another transformational year, in which we firmly established Insulet as the market leader in automated insulin delivery. In 2023, we realized a 30% revenue growth, which marked our eighth consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth and represented dollar growth of almost $400 million. We accomplished this while also significantly expanding margins and generating positive free cash flow. Our record new customer starts in 2023, fueled our global growth and our Omnipod 5 AID system, which generated $1 billion in revenue in 2023 is transforming diabetes management. We entered 2024 with significant momentum, and we are looking forward to a year of many growth catalysts ahead. On today's call, I want to do three things: first, discuss our financial results and market traction. Next, I'll provide an update on the continuing progress of our clinical efforts and then review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our fourth quarter revenue once again exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 35%, including U.S. growth of 43%. Part of our outperformance was driven by U.S. distributors placing additional orders near the end of the quarter, which we had not factored into our guidance. We'll provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Yet even without these additional orders, we closed out 2023 ahead of our expectations, including healthy margin expansion. These are remarkable results, and I want to thank our global team for their execution and dedication. We are proud of the incredible impact the Omnipod product platform is having on people with diabetes. We recently achieved milestones of roughly 425,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, which represents growth of approximately 25% from this time last year. This also includes almost 250,000 customers on Omnipod 5, which has proven to be revolutionary. And Omnipod DASH continues to drive strong new customer starts in our U.S. type 2 diabetes market as well as in most of our international markets. We are thrilled that our unique technology is making a meaningful impact on the diabetes community, advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA cleared, fully disposable pod-based AID system. This makes our product unique and clearly differentiated from competitors' offers. These product attributes underpin our competitive advantages and are key to fueling our growth, further establishing our leadership position and expertise in the diabetes market. The fully on-body wearable AID experience of Omnipod 5 dramatically reduces the daily burden of living with diabetes. And its simplicity, ease of use and broad and affordable access are also key drivers of its rapid adoption. For almost a decade, we have significantly invested in U.S. pharmacy channel access, including building the infrastructure, developing key pharmacy relationships, creating an easy onboarding pathway and building deep in-house expertise, all of which has resulted in a strong and leading channel access we have today. We continue to strengthen Omnipod's access and affordability, including our innovation pipeline that will go through this channel by building on our advantages. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, customer retention remains strong. The mix of U.S. new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps continued at an estimated 80-20 percentage split. Today, even with improved technology, most people using insulin still use MDI as their mode of care. More than 60% of people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. are on MDI and the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes are using daily injections. Therefore, bringing people out of MDI and on to Omnipod remains the largest opportunity for us, and we continue to drive pump penetration and share gain in both the type 1 and type 2 markets, strengthening our leadership position. Omnipod 5 not only drove our number one position for U.S. and customer starts in 2023, it was the most prescribed AID system in the U.S. This is because a growing number of health care providers are writing scripts for it. In Q4, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 18,500, up from 17,000 in Q3. We speak with many HCPs and it is clear that Omnipod 5 is the winning choice for AIB. It is extremely gratifying to see the growing demand, confidence and adoption which have led to a growing number of scripts HCPs now write for our system. Our strong new customer starts included continuing adoption of Omnipod in the U.S., type 2 diabetes market. We estimate that no more than 5% of people with type 2 diabetes who need intensive insulin therapy are currently using any kind of pump. And we know that we are already the market leader in that space. We are confident that Omnipod will prove to be a simple and compelling solution for the millions of people globally with type 2 diabetes who today need insulin therapy as a part of their diabetes care regimen as well as the future millions who will naturally progress to requiring insulin as a part of their care. We are well positioned to bring all of the benefits of the Omnipod platform with people with type 2 diabetes both today and in the future. In the fourth quarter, type 2 diabetes patients represented between 20% and 25% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod suite of products. While Omnipod DASH, with its type 2 indication for use is the leading insulin pump operating in this market, we look forward to marketing Omnipod 5 to type 2 patients once we have an expanded indication. The underlying demand is apparent. We expect the last participant to complete our type 2 pivotal trial in the coming weeks, and we plan to submit results to the FDA by the end of 2024 for an expanded indication. We are confident this will be another catalyst that will fuel our growth trajectory, allow us to serve more patients and help us deliver on our mission. We look forward to sharing study results at ADA this June. The success of Omnipod 5, including its early yet powerful impact in 2 of our European markets, led to another strong quarter of new customer starts globally. Internationally, we realized a notable sequential increase in new customer starts, driven by the impact of Omnipod 5 that's having in the U.K. and Germany. Our early success in these countries supports our confidence that it will continue to transform diabetes care and position us as a market leader everywhere Omnipod 5 is available. We remain on track with our Omnipod 5 plus G6 European launch plans with the aim of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers by the end of 2024. We are also thrilled to begin our journey launching Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor. I'll speak to this new opportunity in a moment. In addition to our type 2 pivotal study progress, we are meaningfully advancing several other clinical initiatives. We are excited to attend the ATTD International Conference in Italy in a couple of weeks where we will present data for the Omnipod 5 plus G6 randomized controlled trial. This RCT compared Omnipod 5 to non-AID pump and included study sites in the U.S. and France. We are thrilled to have recently published in the Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics Journal real-world evidence from almost 70,000 people with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating Omnipod 5's effectiveness in a large, diverse population. The data are impressive and demonstrate the strength of the Omnipod 5 algorithm in the real world delivering leading time in range and very low hypoglycemia, reinforcing Omnipod 5 as the obvious choice for clinical outcomes and personalized diabetes care. Central to everything we do is our mission to simplify life for people with diabetes. We want to make it easier for people to get prescribed therapy, get set up on therapy and use therapy consistently over time. This is the point of our evolution feasibility study taking place in New Zealand. Our intent is to have a next-generation algorithm that will further drive simplicity of use. We completed the first feasibility study in participants with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, commencing initially in supervised hotel setting and then progressing to at-home use. We are pleased with the preliminary results and are analyzing the data and making modifications for the next round of subjects. We will present early feasibility results at ATTD. Lastly, we continue to actively enroll participants in our RADIANT study in France, the U.K. and Belgium, which is our Libre 2 integration trial. We began enrollment in September 2023, which is now halfway complete. Feedback has been tremendous and physicians new to Omnipod 5 appreciate its simplicity and potential to reach many more pump-naive users. As a reminder, both our G6 and Libre 2 studies are designed to provide the evidence we need to elevate Omnipod 5 status as superior first-line therapy and help drive our pricing and market access initiatives as we further roll out Omnipod 5 with multiple sensors across our international markets. I'll now provide an update on our innovation progress and we'll focus on three key areas: expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod Go and building our digital and data capabilities. Many of you have heard us say that our current Omnipod 5 system is our \"minimum\" viable product. That's easy to forget given how quickly the market has adopted Omnipod 5 and made it the leading offer. Our current version is on only one operating system, Android. It is integrated with only one continuous glucose monitoring partner, Dexcom and until recently, was commercialized with only G6, and it contains our first-generation algorithm. This is about to change with platform extensions that will strengthen our leadership, deepen our competitive moats and allow us to open up Omnipod 5 to many more customers. To start, we are excited to have commenced our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 over the last 2 weeks. This initial release will allow us time to test the market and build product at scale to prepare for what we are confident will be a very successful full market release of G7 this year. We anticipate an acceleration in new customer starts following a full launch, which will help to fuel our revenue growth more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond. We are also on track with our planned limited market release of Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 Plus in the first half of this year in the Netherlands and U.K. made possible by the CE Mark approval we received earlier this month. We are excited that the option for customers to use Omnipod 5 with both G6 and Libre 2 Plus will enable us to reach many more patients. Our recent and upcoming CGM integrations are important milestones in providing choice to tens of thousands of customers who want to use Omnipod 5 and we believe both integrations will be a significant catalyst for our growth in 2024 and beyond. Rounding out near-term innovation, we are planning for our U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 with the G6 system with our iOS app this year. This will mark a major innovation milestone because so many of our U.S. customers use Apple iPhone and prefer to carry only one phone. Another innovation that will allow us to reach more people and further expand our total addressable market is Omnipod GO, a solution designed for individuals with type 2 who naturally progress to requiring basal-only insulin and want a simple way to receive their daily dose, while avoiding the burden of injections. Our commercial pilot is underway, and it will help us refine our commercialization plans. Omnipod DASH has already made Insulet the leader in insulin delivery for people with type 2 diabetes. And with Omnipon GO, we are well positioned to move upstream in the patient care pathway. When we achieve clearance for Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market, we will bring all of the advantages of our AID system to this market. With these 3 products, our aim is to deliver an Omnipod portfolio that meets the full range of needs of people with type 2 who require insulin as a part of their care. We are excited about our innovation in the space and our ability to address the unmet needs that exist in this patient population. It is a massive global market that we expect will continue to grow, and we have the clear lead to pursue this market opportunity. We are also excited to build on our digital and data capabilities. One of the breakthrough features of Omnipod 5 is the real-time data provided by SIM cards in every controller. We constantly hear from physicians and patients how much they appreciate not needing to plug in for real-time usage data and 100% cloud connectivity has already given us the opportunity to publish the largest, real-world data set on AID. Over time, we plan to use the data to speed our product development, further improve the user experience, streamline physician workflows and build on our competitive advantages. We also continue building digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. In closing, Insulet continues to set the standard for the industry. With a strong 2023 behind us, we see multiple catalysts in the coming year and beyond. We are confident we will drive significant growth and continued success. I want to thank our Insulet global team for your dedication and deep passion for our customers and your commitment to delivering innovation. You are the reason for our success and our ability to continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren. Thanks, Rohin. I'll take the first shot at that, but then I'm sure Lauren may want to comment as well. I mean I think that the main -- there's just a core driver to new customer starts for us, which is Omnipod 5 is clearly the most preferred product in the market. We lead in new customer starts. Wherever we take Omnipod 5, we lead in new customer starts for people coming up with MDI, and we continue to take a lot of competitor share. So the Omnipod 5 offering as it exists today is already an underlying growth driver for us. Then there are a number of things that we'll bring to market in 2024 that will drive a lot of growth. We'll be able to drive international expansion for Omnipod 5 in 2024 as we said. We're aiming to get into the G6 product to market into the Netherlands along with sensor of choice in U.K., Netherlands in the first half. And as we've said, by the end of 2024, we expect to have Omnipod 5 available to the majority of our customers in our European markets. And then obviously, G7. So we're really excited to have been able to accelerate our G7 LMR by a couple of weeks, a little bit earlier than our expectation. We've been in market now with the LMR for not quite 3 weeks, about 2.5 weeks and aim to bring a full market release of G7 during the year, which we think will continue to drive new customer starts for us. So we're very, very excited about that. So there's a lot of catalysts coming in our innovation pipeline that will drive growth on top of the already existing leading market position for Omnipod 5. But I'm sure, Lauren, will want to pick up on -- at least I'm guessing, Lauren, you want to pick up on some of which you asked her as well. Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and nice to hear from you. So one way to think about this is that we're prioritizing the sequencing, right? And so we know that driving the integration with sensors and driving sensor of choice as we call it for customers is really, really important. And you can see -- in a way, you can see what we're doing here because we're already into LMR with G7 in the U.S. We're going to learn a lot about that integration here. We feel very comfortable with it as it has been through [indiscernible]. But you put the LMR out in the market to see the product in the wild, right, and make sure you're happy with it, make sure customers are having a great experience. And we'll learn from that LMR in a way that will allow us to accelerate G7 in the U.S. and then internationally. We haven't guided the timing on anything outside of the US on G7 but the LMR is important in that way. Very similarly, we're looking to be able to accelerate our LMR for the Libre 2 Plus integration in Europe and working hard to get that to market. The experience we're having right now with the RADIANT trial, which is our Libre integration trial in Europe suggest that that's a great wear experience for customers as well. And so you can see we're accelerating that LMR in Europe. We'll learn from that LMR too. So -- and we haven't given any timing guidance on Libre for the U.S., but you can see what we're doing is we're kind of parallel processing the 2 LMRs to maximize our learning and kind of optimize our resource use across the geographies, if that makes sense. Very high priority for us to get sensor integrations up and running to give choice and also because what we want to do is we're really prioritizing making sure that customers that want to be on Omnipod 5 can get on Omnipod 5. And that's our top priorities to drive this. It's really -- it's proven on -- Omnipod 5 has proven to be a revolutionary offer. Lots of people want to be on Omnipod 5. So we're working hard to make sure we get the sensors integrated as quickly as we can into the various geographies as quickly as we can to provide that kind of access and option to customers and working hard to optimize the way we're doing it, so we can maximize our learning in time to market. Yes, Jason, great question. It has been -- we've talked about this consistently in the past. So what we want to do with Omnipod 5 is generate the evidence we need, which is we're doing with our G6 RCT, which I mentioned in the comments we're doing with our RADIANT trial. We're generating the evidence we need to establish Omnipod 5 as a first-line offering and then go and negotiate for reimbursement across our international markets. Reimbursement levels that are commensurate with the extra value we're creating with the Omnipod 5 offering. And so our goal is to drive a price premium. It's a little bit different from what we did in the U.S. because when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S., we launched it into the pharmacy channel, pricing parity with DASH because we knew that would streamline time to full coverage in the market. So we got to full coverage. In the European markets, what we need to do is make sure we're negotiating kind of reimbursement body. It's different in every market, and there's tenders, there's ministries of health and so on, but we need to negotiate those market by market, but we have to generate the evidence that's required to be able to have that conversation. So far, we've been very successful with that. So working in the U.K., we're very comfortable with where we've landed with reimbursement levels in the U.K., working in Germany and so on. And so we're going to continue to drive that and work really hard to achieve a premium for Omnipod 5 everywhere we launch it. And then remind me the second part of your question, it was all the gating factors. Gating factors, it's a little bit different by every market. Sometimes it's reimbursement -- sometimes it's sort of cloud connectivity. We've made a lot of progress on that latter technical front. And then it's just preparing for commercial launch and making sure that everything is lined up to do that. We're making terrific progress. And as we've said, I just want to clarify, actually, I think Jeff just said that we said we'd be in the majority of our markets. We haven't said that. What we've said is that by the end of 2024, there may be a technical problem on the call. What we said by the end of 2024, we will have the majority of our European customers have Omnipod 5 available. Larry, we're having a technical problem on the call. And so I'm going to take my best shot at answering your question. And so on guidance, nothing has really changed from our guidance. I think that the guide we've given on revenue and on new customer starts, I mean, it's pretty consistent with the color we gave on the November call. And the big move is actually the unusual order pattern where we had $20 million to $25 million of revenue pulled forward. We're still guiding to ramping new customer starts in 2024. The change -- the only real change in the guidance that we're giving compared to color is that we're guiding to a 13% -- roughly a 13% operating margin for 2024, which is actually an increase from the color we gave on the November call. And there are a number of opportunities for us to do that. But we delivered really strong operating income through 2023 and actually exceeded what we had guided to for 2023 because if you remember our guide in 2023, it was high-single-digits, which you call it like 9.5% plus, and we ended up delivering well above that. And we're now guiding to 13%, which as Lauren explained in the prepared comments, represents 100 basis points over what we achieved at the end of 2023, but more than 200 basis points or roughly 200 basis points above what we would have achieved without the revenue pull forward. That 13% OI guide, is the only real change from the color we gave in November, if that makes sense. Thanks, Margaret. It's a great question. And again, I'll start and if Lauren wants to chime in on the back, I'd welcome that. Just to go back to context, we actually didn't put this in the prepared comments this quarter, but we've -- in the past, we've pointed out the endo market is somewhere around 70 -- 7,000 to 7,500 endos in the U.S. We know that a number of prescribers that we have are either endocrinologists themselves or their so-called physician extenders, which will include nurse practitioners and physician assistance, but we're clearly getting prescriptions beyond that. We're clearly getting prescription writing outside of endo practices, in PCP practices and in smaller practices, and that dynamic continues to grow, and we can see it in our own data. We don't have perfect insight into it out of the various available data. But we can see we're reaching more and more health care practitioners. And that's we believe we're doing that through word of mouth, through our promotion activities, which include both direct-to-patient activities and also direct-to-physician promotional activities online. And then the other thing I'll say is that it's been very, very powerful for us, sort of along the same lines. The Omnipod GO commercial pilot has proven to be a terrific investment for us this year because what we're learning -- we're learning a lot more about what happens in the primary care channel for people living with diabetes. And just a couple of things we're seeing, we've learned a lot about the target patient population for Omnipod, we've learned that primary care practices when they think pump, they think the [indiscernible] thing with a tube that they would never prescribe and then when they see Omnipod, there's a little bit of a head dynamic, and they say, \"Wait, you know what, that's so easy. My patients could do that. We could do that.\" And so we're very confident we're going to be able to drive demand for the Omnipod platform across primary care. And I think we're seeing more type 1 patients than we anticipated in the primary care channel. So to your point, we're very optimistic that as we continue to drive learnings out of our Omnipod Go pilot, we're going to be able to find a new kind of new avenues for driving demand for Omnipod and really driving pod therapy -- Omnipod therapy into the world where patients need it most. And so we're very optimistic about that. And so we continue to see that trend as a positive signal for us, but we're really excited about what we're learning out in the world with our commercial pilot as we go. Why don't -- we'll have Lauren start on the guide and then I'll pick up on the competition. Go ahead, Lauren. And we can always clarify this offline, right? So -- but it's a decrease in the denominator, increase in the numerator for '24, you get the normalized number, right? So it's a double whammy in that $20 million to $25 million. So the underlying guide remains the same, respectively. On the competition, yes, we continue to have really good new customer starts. And historically, we always had 80/20 of MDI and competitive switching. After the launch of Omnipod 5, we obviously caught a lot of competitive switchers, and we've done really, really well. We continue to have. So if you think about pre-Omnipod-5 and that 20% of competitive switches and with Omnipod 5 and 20% of competitive switchers, it's a larger number than it was, right? So because new customer starts are up overall, so we continue to do very, very well. And the underlying dynamic there is we also retain the vast majority of customers that we get from competitors. Retention is very, very strong. And we said that, we do think -- we had the benefit now of hearing our two competitors' calls, and we have the benefit of seeing what's happening out in the market. We don't see -- there's little things around the edges, I would say. We don't see any fundamental underlying shift in the competitive dynamic. Omnipod 5 continues to be the preferred product. But I would say that one of our competitors has done a better job of staunching the bleeding in their installed base. And so you can see a little bit of that dynamic going on in the market. But we're still clearly the preferred offer -- clearly winning with MDI and just winning with new customer starts overall very, very clearly in the market. Great question. Thank you. Pharmacy is -- our offer -- the Omnipod platform offer is much better suited to the pharmacy channel than tubed pumps are, much, much better suited. 2 pumps at the end of the day, continue to be durable equipment. And there's all kinds of things that I can go into the weeds here and talk about this, but I'll just say it's not a surprise that we see competitors trying to figure out how to get in the pharmacy channel with a durable tube pump because we've been so successful in establishing the pharmacy channel for AID. And as we would expect, competitors are -- we've established market leadership across basically the whole range of our offer and competitors are going to chase that. It's -- there's -- what we've learned is, there's a very big learning curve in pharmacy. It's very, very different from the DME channel, the economics work better for us because there's -- in all cases, the value is actually in the pump, whether it's a durable pump or it's the pod. And the fact that the value is created in our consumable, which is the pod gives us an inherent advantage as we -- it starts to get a little abstract, but it gives us an inherent advantage as we're in that channel. Couple that with the fact that we have very, very wide coverage in the pharmacy channel, we have established contracts across the PBMs. And we've had very successful growth with all of our PBM partners. We think we have a very defensible position there. People who use insulin go into the pharmacy to get their insulin, whether they're getting it from retail pharmacy. So it's a great place for them to also get their AID-pump therapy and Omnipod continues to be very uniquely positioned and the value prop of Omnipod in the pharmacy channel will continue to be very uniquely positioned as we go forward. Yes, great question. The way to think about Omnipod GO is that we hear a different language about this. And I'd just be really clear, we're not in limited market release with GO, we're in a commercial pilot, right? And so that's a step before -- I think I said this last quarter on our call as well, that's a step before an LMR. The product itself is ready. It's out on patients, it's fully approved. We continue to grow coverage for it. So that's a step but we're ahead of schedule and coverage. So the way to think about the Omnipod GO commercial pilot is the gating factor is not timing, it's learning, right? So what we're using it for is to establish the right commercial model, both for GO and for the primary care chain. And one of the reasons we're so excited about the pilot is that we are learning an awful lot out of that pilot. And so -- and where we're going to land on this thing, whether we commercialize in '24 with GO or commercialize -- get to more of an FMR in '24 or sometime in '25, where we're going to land is we're going to be in the primary care channel first and second, one way or another, we're going to have call points in primary care. And the other thing is we will have the broadest offering for people living with type 2 diabetes who need insulin delivery. So we're already the market leader with DASH in that space very clearly. We know -- we have our pivotal trial going to Omnipod 5. As we said before, we know Omnipod 5 is actually being used off label. In a lot of cases, we're not promoting Omnipod 5 off-label, but we'll have -- our goal is to have the label for Omnipod 5 in the short order coming out of our pivotal trial, and we continue to have a plan to file with the FDA for that label extension in '24, and we'll have Omnipod GO. And that gives you the whole coverage for people using insulin with type 2 all the way from I'm initiating basal insulin 2, I'm using intensive insulin. And so we'll have that full portfolio of products, and we'll have a very clear way to commercialize that in both primary care and in the endocrinology channel. So that's why I'd say I'm very excited about the commercial pilot with Omnipod GO. We are learning the ton and it's going to make us much better commercially as we get into that and get that full portfolio on market. Yes. We think it's a really big opportunity. If you look at the sensor market, you've got millions of people using Dexcom sensors and millions of people using Abbott's sensors. So the G6, G7 family products and the Libre 2 and Libre -- now emerging Libre 3 family products by creating the integration across that range. So prioritizing G7, prioritizing Libre 2 plus and then 3 that we're working in parallel. It opens up a really large substantial market for us. The two -- we love working with both of our partners. They both have great technology. They're both really good partners. Development pathway with both of them is really strong. They're slightly -- they have slightly different positions in the main geographies of the U.S. and Europe in terms of their installed base, but both of them have very large installed bases. And both of them have, as we've always said, CGM pays road for us because people get used to having an on-body experience with a sensor and it makes it much easier for them to then jump to an on-body experience with an Omnipod. And so we think it opens up -- you can go look at the market share, the estimated market share for our two partners, but we think the Libre integrations open up a large installed base both in Europe and the U.S. of people who will be ready for Omnipod because they're used to a on-body CGM experience. Thanks, Sam. If you just look at the size of the end markets there, and I'll repeat numbers that we shared before. In the U.S., there are about 1.6 million people living with type 1 diabetes. And if that market is about, probably, something less than 40% penetrated with AID therapy. Then in the type 2 market, there are somewhere between 3 million and 4 million people living with type 2 who are on basal-only therapy. And somewhere around 2.5 million people living with type 2 in the U.S. who need intensive insulin therapy, so basal plus bolus. Omnipod 5 is really aimed at that intensive insulin therapy population, about 2.5 million people in the U.S. And therefore, it's a larger end market than Omnipod 5 plays in now with its current label. We know that, that market is less than 5% penetrated with AID therapy. And we are already the market leader in that segment of the market because Omnipod DASH has a label there, and we know we're the clear market leader in the space. So we're very optimistic. Omnipod 5 is very easy to use. It takes a lot of the burden off of managing your diabetes. That's why it's been so successful in the type 1 population. And we're very optimistic about that value proposition going into the intensive insulin using type 2 population, which is a larger end market than the one we're playing in today. So we think it is a really important opportunity and a market that, by the way, will continue to grow over time. Thanks, Matt. I'll do those in reverse order. The first one is on the tubeless form factor. We obviously watch our competitor pipelines as closely as we can. And in terms of what is out there publicly that we can see, we don't see anything coming in that time frame that's even close to what we have in market right now with Omnipod 5, just in terms of the whole package, the convenience, the ease of use, the scalability, the wear experience, automated needle insertion, we could go on and on about the feature set that we are very confident in our competitive position. We're never complacent. We have a lot of respect for our competitors, and we know that what -- because Omnipod in general, but Omnipod 5 has been so successful, everybody wants to chase it. So that just makes sense, and that's how competition works. But we are very confident in our competitive position, and we don't see anything coming in anybody's pipeline that even matches what we have, and we're going to continue to drive innovation. So we're going to extend our lead. On the first part of your question, it's a really good question. Yes. We're obviously doing very, very well in the market with our existing offer. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it's really -- we really see it as our minimum viable product, and we've done so well with it. But on specifically the G6 and G7, what you're seeing and it's -- you can go look analytically at the underlying script data, what you're seeing is G7 is really doing well with new customer starts. So a lot of people going on to G7. And you guys have heard this is probably corny but you've heard me use the metaphor before, about fishing. If you think we're out fishing in the stock pond, the pond has a lot of G6 in it, but it's got more and more G7 in it all the time. And so we want to be able to go out there and fish in both bonds and proportionally, G7 is a larger and larger part of the market. We want to -- now I'm going to mix metaphors. We want that wind at our back of all the patients coming under G7. We know the offer together, Omnipod 5 and G7 is going to be terrific and drive a lot of growth for us just like Omnipod 5 with G6 had. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We are really excited to have delivered another outstanding year for Insulet. We're focused on extending our leading position with our deep expertise and strong emphasis on innovation, operational excellence and further improving the customer experience. We remain committed to driving value for our shareholders through margin expansion and cash flow generation, all while maintaining our emphasis on investing for growth. I also want to once again thank our outstanding Insulet global team for their dedication and their focus on innovation and passion to our customers. Thank you, everybody. And with that, I'll thank you all and wish you all a great evening. Good night, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. 2023 was another exciting year for Insulet, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We have strong momentum with many catalysts that will drive revenue growth and margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term. In Q4, we generated strong global, new customer starts fueled by the continued high demand for Omnipod 5, not only in the U.S. but also in our first 2 European markets. . As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 37% revenue growth in Q4, driven by global Omnipod growth of over 35%. We benefited from a shift in order timing and an increase in days on hand at certain pharmacy distributors, which I'll speak to in a moment. Without these benefits, our results still exceeded these guidance ranges. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 130 basis point tailwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 43%, which continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and the related premium for pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a benefit for the many reasons Jim spoke to, and our efforts to drive increased volume through this channel have resulted in almost all of our U.S. volume going through the pharmacy channel. The recurring net volume benefit we recognized in Q4 from new customers who received their starter kits and first refill orders was in line with our expectations and remain consistent with Q3 levels. We expect this trend to continue. Also as expected, the same net volume benefit from existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 was immaterial since the vast majority had already previously converted. In Q4, U.S. revenue benefited from 2 dynamics not previously contemplated in our guidance. First, our largest U.S. pharmacy wholesalers collectively placed an estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated from the first quarter of 2024 in advance of our implementation of a new ERP system at the start of 2024. The second benefit was an increase in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $10 million to $15 million as pharmacy distributors returned to their normal levels. As a reminder, in the first half of 2023, we called out a reduction in inventory days on hand below normal levels. What this boils down to is approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in Q4 that we had not anticipated, contributing approximately 12 points to our U.S. revenue growth. We are proud of our fourth quarter U.S. performance, especially given the tougher comparison due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of 2022. Additionally, new customer starts in Q4 were slightly down from Q3 as expected as the market is moving from Dexcom's G6 sensor to G7. We are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. And as Jim shared, we expect new customer starts to accelerate throughout 2024 as we ramp our commercial efforts. Overall, our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5's success and continued robust demand. International Omnipod revenue increased 12.5%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree, a benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, both of which drove notable increases in new customer starts. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 550 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 250 points favorable versus our guide. In Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remained stable. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, representing a $5.5 million increase, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 70.9%, up over 1,200 basis points. Excluding the impact of the 2022 medical device corrections, adjusted gross margin increased 620 basis points to 70.7% in Q4 2023. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and product mix. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable mix that included a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. Partially offsetting the favorable contributors were expected higher production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses increased in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory, including gearing up for near-term product launches globally. Adjusted operating margin was 20.7% and adjusted EBITDA was 26.9% of revenue. Both were above our expectations, primarily due to the $30 million to $40 million revenue benefit I mentioned, which had an estimated 360 basis point favorable impact on adjusted operating margin. To a lesser extent, both outperformed due to our higher-than-expected gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $700 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. At the end of January, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B at a lower interest rate, which will reduce interest expense on an annualized basis by almost $2 million. We also achieved the milestone during the year of turning free cash flow positive, generating approximately $70 million in 2023. We continue to strengthen our financial position, giving us the flexibility to invest throughout our organization to drive long-term sustainable growth while at the same time expanding our margins and generating positive free cash flow. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. We continue to expect another year of large dollar growth even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023, most notably from our Omnipod 5 ramp. We expect to approach total company revenue of $2 billion at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 18% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 17%. As a reminder, our total company growth expectations exclude approximately 3 points due to the estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 21% driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in 2024, resulting from the significant 2 scripts and retail channel net stocking volume benefits in 2023. In addition, our expectations exclude approximately 4 points of growth due to the estimated orders that shifted into 2023. When factoring this into both periods, our normalized expectation for 2024 at the high end of our range is in line with the color we provided on our third quarter call of mid-20% growth. We anticipate new customer starts in the first half of 2024 to be slightly lower than the levels we had in the second half of 2023 due to normal seasonality trends, and we expect an acceleration in the second half of 2024 following a full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. Also, as a reminder, estimated revenue from Omnipod 5 with our iOS app and from Omnipod GO is expected to be immaterial. We also currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more towards the second half of 2024 due to the timing of new customer starts, partially offset by the Q4 2023 stocking benefit. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 10%, which is in line with the 2024 color we previously provided of high single digits. On a reported basis, we are assuming no foreign currency impact. We expect growth to be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. We are excited to enter our first European markets in the first half of 2024, with Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in another market around the same time. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect these launches to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in 2025. We continue to expect the first half of the year to be in the high single digits range and to accelerate in the second half of the year to a range of high single digits to low double digits, primarily due to a more meaningful contribution from our Omnipod 5 U.K. and Germany launches and, to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect a 50% to 60% decline in line with the 2024 color we previously provided. Turning to 2024 gross margin. We expect a range of 68% to 69% and anticipated benefit from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are higher costs associated with our new product launches. We expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half due to accelerating revenue throughout the year and continued manufacturing efficiencies. In 2024, we plan to expand both gross and operating margins while driving market growth. We expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D and clinical and expand our sales force and other functions to support our commercial efforts and growth initiatives, including our near-term product lines. Our sales force expansion includes hiring some reps specifically focused on pediatrics, a population for which Omnipod has always captured a large share. Even with increased investments, we have many opportunities to significantly expand margins and increase shareholder value, and we remain committed to doing just that. We expect operating margin to be approximately 13%, up approximately 100 basis points from 2023 adjusted operating margin. When factoring in the 130 basis point year-over-year unfavorable impact in 2024 from the $20 million to $25 million shift in order timing, we expect operating margins to be approximately 200 basis points higher in 2024 over 2023. We expect operating margin to significantly improve in the second half of the year over the first half due to revenue ramping during the year and continued manufacturing improvements. We have many catalysts for growth in 2024 and considerable opportunities to drive further margin expansion over the near and long term coming from scaling the business efficiently even with the continued focused investments in our robust innovation pipeline and commercial efforts. We expect capital expenditures to almost double from 2023 due to the timing of spend to support our planned 2024 production at our new Malaysia manufacturing facility as well as investments to support continuous improvement efforts in our other manufacturing locations and to a lesser degree, investment in IT infrastructure. Turning to our first quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 15% to 18% and total company growth of 17% to 20%. Our total company revenue expectations exclude approximately 6 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 19% to 22%, which excludes over 8 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $5 million to $6 million. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter and year of significant financial performance and strategic execution. We have strong momentum at the start of 2024 with many catalysts ahead and as a result, we are in a fantastic position to continue to grow and efficiently scale our business. The global market opportunities for Insulet are tremendous, and we will continue to invest in innovation with an increased commitment to significant margin expansion. We are well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and to deliver on our mission for our customers. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. So yes, just in November when we gave guidance, it really hasn't changed much in our view. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a $30 million to $40 million shift in revenue -- or sorry, incremental revenue. Of that $10 million to $15 million was an increase in days on hand inventory levels. And so that, we have seen the inventory levels brought down earlier in the first half of the year. So that was a piece of that. The rest of it, the $20 million to $25 million was the shift that we saw in order timing from Q1 to Q4. So for that, that was in advance of our ERP. And if you were to normalize for that, which contributed about 12 points benefit to our U.S. revenue growth rate, we really achieved the high end of our guidance range there. So yes, we have a lot of additional opportunities for improvement, especially if we exceed our revenue targets and you saw that in Q4, we had tremendous operating margin. It was over 20% on an adjusted basis. And if you normalize for the revenue shift, it was about 17%. So if we can exceed revenue, we can have a lot of incremental margin opportunity. But keep in mind that we will be balancing that with investment. So as Jim mentioned, we have a lot of new product launches coming up, and we want to make sure we're executing on our strategic imperatives to drive future growth in 2025 and beyond. So we will be balancing that with the revenue drop through to the bottom line. Yes. So really, it's more about a volume business at this point. We did get a big price lift throughout 2023 from the conversions into the pharmacy channel. But as we've mentioned previously, those conversions are largely complete by this point. So we're not seeing that going forward. We did have a price increase like we normally do in early September, which was pretty minimal. It's just under 3% kind of in line with the cost of living adjustment. So just keep in mind there, though, we don't see the full benefit of that because some of it goes to the DDM in terms of rebates and to the wholesaler fees. So at this point, for 2024, I would pretty much say that you should focus on the volume, not the price has leveled off. The great news is that we are getting that continued price lift going forward, but it shouldn't be an incremental change. Yes, I'm happy to start off and then Jim feel free to add on. Yes, we definitely feel like we have room for expansion, both on margin and gross margin in the near term and in the longer term. We did great in Q4, and we have lots of opportunities as we're setting up with the product launches that we have this year that will accelerate the top line and be able to allow us to drop more through. We haven't put out guidance beyond 2024, but we are planning on doing a long-range plan later in this year. Sure. So for 2024, even with the significant volume benefit that we realized in '23, we're guarding to very strong revenue growth. We expect to achieve almost $2 billion in revenue and our guide represents $300 million of revenue growth in terms of dollars. So your question in terms of what changed from the call we provided, it was really just that revenue shift of 20 million to 25 million of orders that were -- would have been Q1 but were placed in advance of our ERP implementation. So the estimated impact of that is 3 points on the total company and 4 points on U.S. Omnipod. So overall, our guide is strong. And as we've mentioned, we have many catalysts for growth in '24 that's going to help accelerate it and particularly in the back half with those new customer starts and provide strong revenue growth for the year and into 2025 and beyond. No. I mean it doesn't really stay on the shelf that long. I mean we -- it's a pretty efficient channel. In terms of the visibility into the date on hand though that's not something that we ever included in our guidance, and that's something that we can't control. And so unfortunately, this quarter, we had the double whammy of them taking the inventory level back up after they had taken them down earlier in the year. And then at the same time, we had the ERP pull forward dynamic. So I don't expect that we'd see something of that magnitude. But again, when we have something like this, what we do is, we call out and we tell you when it happens, we don't have the ability to guide to it. It's not something in our control."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Deborah Gordon, Vice President Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our third quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for Insulet with rapid growth and achievement of many strategic milestones. Thanks to our global team's execution, dedication and focus we are on track to complete another transformational year and enter 2024 with significant momentum. On today's call, I want to do three things; discuss our financial results and market traction provide an update on our continuing progress in clinical and market access work, and review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our third quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of over 27% including US growth of 35%. We also achieved total company growth of 25%. These are remarkable results especially coming in the context of our strong prior year comparables. As a result, we raised guidance once again for the full year. Performance was driven primarily by the huge success of Omnipod 5, our revolutionary automated insulin delivery system. It is gratifying to see the positive impact Omnipod 5 is having as it continues to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes and we are only in the early innings. Q3 represented the anniversary of the US launch of our Omnipod 5 platform. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA-cleared fully disposable pod-based AID system and it continues to transform diabetes management. Its simplicity, ease of use, widespread and affordable access and improved real-world outcomes have made Omnipod 5, the leading AID offering on the market. With the added benefits of US pharmacy channel access pay-as-you-go model and an easy onboarding pathway, Omnipod 5 makes it simple and efficient for health care practitioners, patients and payers to conveniently prescribe access and afford our breakthrough technology. We are now also beginning the global rollout of Omnipod 5 in our international markets starting with the UK this past June. With one full quarter under our belts in the UK we are seeing very strong early adoption. In Q3, Omnipod 5 drove accelerated new customer starts in the UK taking revenue growth to almost 45% year-over-year and driving approximately 70% sequential growth in new customer starts. It's a strong early sign of the global power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes care. During Q3, we also commenced the rollout of Omnipod 5 in Germany in August and early momentum is exciting. Based on these results, we are confident that Omnipod 5 will emerge as the market-leading offer everywhere it is available. The success of Omnipod 5 led to another outstanding quarter of new customer starts both in the US and globally. In the US, Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q3 and customer retention remains strong. In the US in Q3, Omnipod new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 80-20 percentage split which is in line with our historical mix. Omnipod was specifically designed for individuals on MDI and as expected, we are driving pump penetration across all age groups in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, while also growing our share positioning Insulet as a leader in these markets. We estimate that we are the clear leader bringing customers into the market from MDI. In addition to growing awareness of Omnipod and high product demand among patients, a growing number of HCPs are writing scripts for it. In Q3, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 17,000 up from over 15,000 in Q2. In a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists this shows the broad appeal and ease of prescription of Omnipod 5. Importantly, this extensive reach is critical to access patients who are not seen at the high-volume pump-prescribing clinics that historically defines the pump market. Omnipod 5's broad appeal is also evidenced by the growing number of scripts that these HCPs write for our system. Omnipod loyalty amongst Podders has been a hallmark of our brand for many years and it is great to see the growing demand and confidence amongst the prescribing HCPs. In fact an increasing number tell us that when given the choice their patients overwhelmingly choose Omnipod. Our results in Q3 also strengthen our conviction that we'll be able to reach the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy as a part of their care. In the quarter, Omnipod adoption in the Type 2 market continued at a steady pace with Type 2 patients representing approximately 20% of our US new customer starts. These new customer starts come from across our Omnipod portfolio of products, demonstrating the clear benefits that our products offer the Type 2 population. Omnipod DASH continues to be the leading insulin pump offer with an indication for use in the Type 2 market. While we can't yet market Omnipod 5 for Type 2, the obvious underlying demand for AID in the Type 2 market is encouraging. And we look forward to bringing Omnipod 5 to these customers once we complete our pivotal trial and secure an extension to our existing indication for use. And to that end, we are very excited to announce that we have reached our enrollment goal this week in our US Type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this is a study of up to 400 participants with a 13-week protocol comparing Omnipod 5 to participants' previous therapy. The feedback from HCPs and study participants continues to be very strong and strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will have a big impact in the critically underserved population of Type 2 patients who require insulin. We will provide further updates as the trial progresses. I'd like to make a few comments about the ongoing debate about the impact of GLP-1s on our markets. As we've made clear, we regard the GLP-1 class of drugs as an important innovation for people with Type 2 diabetes and they have been indicated for use in Type 2 diabetes for several years. These drugs help many of the same patients we aim to help and we applaud their innovation. Further as a reminder, we believe GLP-1s do not materially impact our end markets. They are not indicated for use in Type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune disorder and there is no apparent mechanism for them to impact the course of type one as a condition. Likewise, there is no apparent mechanism for GLP-1 drugs to alter the underlying progression of beta cell decline that is characteristic of Type 2 diabetes. Last month we published a short slide presentation going into these issues in more detail. This week we published an update to those slides based upon data that was recently presented at EASD. In a large retrospective study of 23,000 users of semaglutide, the evidence presented suggests three important conclusions. First, semaglutide has almost identical impact on glycemic control as liraglutide in terms of the magnitude and duration of A1c reduction. Second, this real-world evidence shows a very clear relationship between dose adherence and glycemic control such that only the most adherent users receive the level of benefit that has been demonstrated in more controlled clinical settings. Finally and importantly, weight loss and the persistence of weight loss for semaglutide users in this study was demonstrated to be independent of glycemic control. In short, real-world evidence shows that patients using semaglutide continue to have their diabetes progress with limited or no incremental duration of effect over previous drugs and type 2 diabetes continues to progress even with weight loss. For those who are interested in more detail, we refer you to our updated presentation which is available on the Insulet Investor page. These data reinforce our existing view. Because the underlying disease continues to progress most people with type 2 diabetes will eventually need to incorporate insulin into their therapy. Insulet is incredibly well-positioned to serve these customers as they progress in their condition and need to add first basal and then intensive insulin into their treatment. We are already winning in this market and we continue to have strong conviction that people with type 2 diabetes represent a large and underserved population. We are continuing our efforts to bring the full power of a broad portfolio of insulin delivery options including Omnipod DASH, Omnipod 5, and Omnipod GO, which I will come back to in a few moments. In addition to our type 2 pivotal trial, we are progressing several additional clinical initiatives. We are pleased to have completed the protocol with the last participant in our randomized controlled trial using Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6. We're in the process of analyzing and preparing the data, which we expect to show the clear benefits of Omnipod 5 therapy over non-AID systems. We are also making great progress with the RADIANT study which is our Libre 2 Integration trial, for which we began enrollment in September. Clinicians have remarked about the simplicity and ease of transition for MDI users to Omnipod 5 in the outpatient setting including in regions where it is often the norm for AID therapy to occur in the hospital for days due to the complexity of existing tubed pump offerings. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre 2 sensor has advanced to the point where study participants are using the system. Both of these studies will provide the evidence we need to drive pricing and market access initiatives as we launch Omnipod 5 across our international markets. I'd now like to turn to three key areas of innovation for us; expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod GO, and driving the future of AID with our advanced algorithm program. The widespread success of Omnipod 5 makes it easy to forget that the current version of our offering is in some ways our minimum viable product. In order to achieve the full promise of the platform, our aim is to expand on customer choice, both for phone control and for CGM use. In that context, we are excited to have received FDA clearance for our 510(k) for the Omnipod iOS app. This is another major innovation milestone for Insulet and iOS is one of the most requested features from our customers. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to provide the iOS option to our existing Omnipod 5 customer base as well as future customers. Because the iOS app represents a completely new software platform we expect to begin a US limited market release in early 2024. And upon successful completion, we will make iOS for Omnipod 5 broadly available as soon as possible. With regard to CGM, our efforts to expand our sensor integrations with our partners, Dexcom and Abbott, continue to steadily progress. I've already mentioned our progress with Libre sensor integration in the context of our European trial. We are also hard at work to complete our integration with Dexcom's G7 sensor and we are excited to announce that we are planning for a limited market release of Omnipod 5 plus G7 also in early 2024. Omnipod 5 is the market-leading offer and with these coming innovations, we are confident we will be able to maintain and extend that leadership. A key innovation effort that moves us upstream from AID is Omnipod GO, which is designed to radically simplify the initiation of basal insulin therapy for people who need to start insulin as their type 2 diabetes progresses. Even small penetration into this market will meaningfully contribute to our long-term growth trajectory. We have commenced the commercial pilot for Omnipod GO in the US, which includes HCPs that we don't typically call on who are new to Omnipod most of whom who are primary care physicians. Our commercial pilot is providing us with the opportunity to present Omnipod GO and also to educate PCPs on all of our Omnipod offerings. Although early in our pilot, PCPs are telling us that Pod therapy is much easier than pump therapy. As a result these HCPs want to learn about the entire Omnipod portfolio. We expect both Omnipod GO and Omnipod DASH to make the treatment pathway far easier for these type 2 patients. Learnings from our ongoing Omnipod GO commercial, pilot will help us to refine our plans for commercialization in 2024. We are continuing to progress work on our next-generation AID algorithm with our Evolution feasibility trial which we began earlier in the year and which is being conducted in New Zealand. The goal of this feasibility study is to test potential enhancements to the Omnipod 5 algorithm in order to further drive simplicity of use. We've been able to launch this study very early in the life cycle of our AID offerings, specifically because of the unique aspects of Omnipod 5, both because the on-market algorithm is highly effective and because of our ability to gather actual usage data from essentially the entire population of Omnipod 5 users. We expect that cloud connectivity for -- of Omnipod 5 coupled with our data sciences capabilities will allow us to materially accelerate our algorithm development efforts over time. Finally, an important update on our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. In August, we filed a suit in the US against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the misappropriation of Insulet's proprietary trade secrets. Last month, after requesting preliminary relief and obtaining some initial evidence, the court granted our request for a preliminary injunction against EOFlow, which prohibits EOFlow from manufacturing marketing or selling to any new customer any product that we designed developed or manufactured using or relying on Insulet's trade secrets. The court also extended the prior injunction issue to restrain EOFlow from disclosing to any third party information that contains derives from or incorporates Insulet's confidential information. In granting Insulet's motion the court found \"very substantial indeed strong evidence of misappropriation\" and \"that Insulet is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secrets claim.\" We have invested considerable resources over many years developing our Omnipod products and we are confident we have a clear lead technically and in terms of scalability. We will continue to vigorously defend our IP to protect those investments. In closing, we completed another outstanding quarter and we have sustained momentum across our business. We are enjoying continued rapid growth in the US type 1 market and we're seeing accelerating adoption in our international markets where Omnipod 5 is launched. We are also seeing continued growth in the type 2 market across our Omnipod offerings. We are excited about the catalysts coming in 2024 with iOS functionality CGM-integrated Omnipod GO that unlock a lot of market growth for many years to come. I want to thank our entire Insulet global team for their engagement and hard work as we continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. Before I turn the call over to Lauren, I want to welcome and congratulate her on her role as our Interim CFO and Treasurer. Lauren is our Chief Accounting Officer and has been with Insulet for close to five years. She has long been a key member of our finance team and has contributed significant value to the company and to shareholders during her tenure with us. We are thrilled to have Lauren in this role to support our continued execution of our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren.\nLauren Budden: Thanks so much, Jim. It's an honor to serve as interim CFO. As Jim shared, Insulin achieved another quarter of robust growth financial performance and strategic progress. We once again delivered strong global new customer starts fueled by huge demand for Omnipod 5 in the US. And we are seeing a very nice uptick in new customer starts in the international markets where we launched Omnipod 5. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 25% revenue growth in Q3, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of over 27%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 180 basis point tailwind compared to Q3 last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 35% and exceeded our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing US pharmacy volume. This includes an increase in volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH and the related premium for Pods in the US pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a competitive advantage and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q3 represented between 90% and 95% of our total US volume. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net tailwind of approximately $10 million, which is in line with what we expected for Q3 guidance. As a reminder, since our launch, we have realized a recurring net volume benefit from new customers as well as from Omnipod customers converting to Omnipod 5, many of whom received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter plus some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Our estimates have been net of those Omnipod 5 customers who skipped an order in the period. In Q3, as we expected, the volume benefit from conversions has been normalizing and was therefore immaterial as the majority of our existing customers already switched to Omnipod 5. Going forward, we expect continued benefit from the two script dynamics, as we drive Omnipod 5 new customer starts. In Q3, US attrition and global utilization remained stable. International Omnipod revenue increased 8%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree incremental benefit from our Omnipod 5 launch in the UK, which drove a notable increase in new customer starts. These benefits were partially offset by slightly higher attrition as we continue to be impacted by AID competition including lower distributor orders. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 720 basis point tailwind over the prior year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 27%, which was slightly below our guidance range, due to a lower forecast from our partners. Gross margin was 67.8%, up over 1,200 basis points and included income of $1.9 million due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year when we took a charge of approximately $37 million in Q3 last year. Excluding both, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 67.3% in Q3 of this year. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. These increases were partially offset by expected higher production costs as US manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses were up year-over-year in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin was 12.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 19.1%. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $1.9 million and were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $685 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our innovation pipeline and other key areas of our organization in order to build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 29% to 30% and total company revenue growth to a range of 26% to 27%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to a range of 37% to 38%. This increase is primarily driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption stemming from consecutive strong new customer starts and to a lesser extent ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as from recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q4 of last year was the first full quarter of Omnipod 5 sales contributing to a tougher comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. The prior year included the two-script benefit, which was in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. It also included retail channel stocking. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance range and now expect 9% to 10% growth. On a reported basis we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 100 basis points. We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption as well as the benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model we expect Omnipod 5 to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our guidance range of a 45% to 50% decline. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We are raising our adjusted gross margin expectations to a range of 66% to 67% and expect to achieve the midpoint of this range. The increase from our prior guide is driven by improved manufacturing costs as well as higher-than-expected revenue including favorable mix. Although certain headwinds that we experienced during 2023 will carry over into next year, we expect to see further gross margin improvement in 2024. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 9% to 10% given our revenue and gross margin outperformance. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. Turning to our fourth quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod and total company growth of 22% to 25%. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 28% to 31%. Even with the challenging comp due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of last year our new customers start momentum and the benefits of our annuity model continue to fuel our revenue growth, including strong expected sequential dollar growth in Q4. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 300 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $5 million due to timing of production and orders. We have sustained momentum across our business and we are poised for another strong year in 2024. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our Q4 call in February, I will provide some color now on how we are thinking about 2024 given the strong momentum we see in the business. We anticipate another year of large dollar growth in 2024, even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023 from our Omnipod 5 ramp. For US Omnipod, we expect a growth rate within the mid-20% range, fueled by Omnipod 5 and its strong pace of new customer starts as well as our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. For International, we expect continued growth with Omnipod DASH and more meaningful growth towards the second half of the year from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. All in, that puts us somewhere in the high single digits for the year with the second half of the year accelerating to a range of high single digits to low double-digits. For Drug Delivery, we expect to see a decline and at the high end of the forecast, we expect the decline to be lower than in 2023. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of solid financial performance and we further positioned Insulet for continued momentum through the end of this year and beyond. As we continue to capitalize on the global market opportunity and invest in innovation, we're poised for another strong year of customer base growth and revenue growth. Opportunities of this magnitude are few and far between, and we are very well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Rohan [ph] on for Robbie. Congrats on a really nice quarter. So there are several exciting developments you outlined on deck for 2024 just between CGM integration iOS launch and continued international expansion. And thanks for providing that color on those preliminary targets for next year as well. But my question is more related to how we should think about the growth contribution from each of these tailwinds next year and the puts and takes and what's assumed in those preliminary targets that you outlined? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead : Thanks Rohan. We're really excited about the growth catalysts that we have coming. We've obviously got great momentum continuing to drive really strong demand and new customer starts in the market really well positioned. And we're very excited about getting into the limited market releases for both iOS and G7 early in the year and also really excited about continuing progress with the Libre integration. So we think they do drive continued growth for us. And in terms of the guide we haven't really guided on the number for that. It's really in our color. But we do think it opens up a lot of potential growth for us across the board. They're all important. And I wouldn't want to necessarily weigh one over the other so we think they all drive catalyst. But I'll ask Lauren and Deb if they want to add any color to that.\nLauren Budden : Sure. Thanks, Jim. So yes we have factored them in. But given our annuity model as Jim said it's not expected to be a meaningful contribution. And we're just entering in LMR in the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Charles [ph] on for Larry. First congrats on the nice quarter. And I just wanted to ask I don't know if you said this already. Did you say new patient starts were a record worldwide? Did I hear that right? And then I got a quick follow-up.\nJim Hollingshead: New customer starts were really strong not quite a record. And so second we're not we don't want to get in the table ranking all of our quarters all the time, but it was our second-highest quarter ever of new customer starts just coming in behind. Q2 was kind of a blowout quarter for us in new customer starts where everything hit on every cylinder. So really happy with the new customer starts, but not quite a record.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Wondering if you might be able to give an update on the search for a new CFO. What exactly are you looking for there? And I wonder if you could give a possible time line you might hope to have an announcement there.\nJim Hollingshead: Sure Charles. First of all we're really happy to have Lauren in the chair. She's been with us for a long time. She's such a great contributor to the company and to our senior finance team and really blessed to have somebody of Lauren's caliber to step in in this interim. And we're conducting a search. We're just out of the market now with the search. We've written the spec. And I don't really want to talk about the characteristics and so on that we're looking for. We think that the CFO job here is a really fun job. We have internal candidates who are really strong including Lauren and early look at the market looks really promising. We want to move as quickly as we can because we want to get to some stability there. But we're very confident we'll get the right person in the role.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Piazzola from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephanie Piazzola : Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask more about margins, which were really strong in the quarter and throughout the year have been showing improvement each quarter. So appreciate the revenue color you gave on 2024. But if there's any color you could share on margins for next year that would be helpful, maybe any of the puts and takes to consider there? Thank you.\nLauren Budden: Yeah. So\u2026\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks Stephanie. I'll turn to Lauren on that. Go ahead. Sorry Lauren. Go ahead, go ahead.\nLauren Budden: So we're not providing guidance today. But just a little colour we are committed to expanding our margins. We're thrilled that we increased gross margins for the full year of 2023 to 66% to 67%. And we are also very thrilled that we increased the high-end of our operating margin guidance range as well. So we're very focused on increasing those and we would expect that trend to continue going forward as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Jayson on for Jayson. So big picture have the physician or user discussions changed with greater GLP adoption? I'm just wondering, if you changed your marketing strategy in any way? And then just quickly as a related follow-up can we assume that the year-over-year growth in new Type 2 users was higher than your overall U.S. Omnipod growth? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Hi Jayson. [Indiscernible] So yeah, no we haven't changed our marketing message at all. The Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod DASH are so effective in insulin delivery. The pilot with The Omnipod 5 Pod though is -- we're learning a lot. It's going well. And GLP-1s are out there. GLP-1 has been indicated for some time in the market. And so we haven't changed our messaging. I think that we continue to learn about GLP-1s. And if we need to adapt our messaging we will. But we haven't had to change our messaging and we continue to obviously have a lot of success. Can you remind me of the second part of your question there, Jayson?\nUnidentified Analyst: Type 2 -- it looked like Type 2 was strong just in terms of Type 2 adoption. Can I assume that it grew faster? If I just look at the number of type two added in 3Q this year versus last year it feels like, it's faster than overall Omnipod growth, if there's a way to bless that assumption that would be great.\nJim Hollingshead: I'm not sure I would jump to that split. Go ahead. Go ahead, Lauren.\nLauren Budden: I was just going to say it grew about the same.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was going to make a joke about it. I think somebody else put the accent kind of gives me a way I am afraid. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious like big picture not about 2024 just slightly longer term how the launch in the U.K. and I mean, I guess, some of what's around Germany, how you're thinking the time line to returning to double-digit growth OUS [ph] could look. And is there anything you're seeing in those markets that would sort of prohibit you from reaccelerating as Omnipod 5 pushes through that region? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks. Yeah, we're so excited about getting Omnipod 5 into multiple markets in Europe. As we said -- as we detailed in the prepared remarks the U.K. launch is going really well. Germany is strong out of the gate. In direct answer to your question we don't see any barriers to driving really strong and robust growth where we launch Omnipod 5. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks we're very confident it's going to be a leading offer wherever we're able to put it in the market. So it's such a great solution it's so easy for customers to use. It drives such great real-world results. And as we get more evidence and we can drive access conversations we're also confident we can get a price premium for the value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so we're all systems -- full speed ahead in getting into our international markets with Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Nice quarter. Jim maybe if I could pin you down on a little bit more detail on the Sensor Integration side. So in LMR on G7 integration in the U.S. early in the year I know it's going to depend on what you see in the field what the feedback is and all that. But just generally do we tend to think of LMRs I could go back and check my notes I guess in O5. Is that like a three-month LMR and then a full launch or just how to think about that? And then on the L2 front obviously you gave some updates internationally. How should we think about the time line L2 in the U.S.? And L3 OUS and U.S. any updates there at all, just once L2 comes out integration is it a 6-month or is it a year? How far down the road might we see L3? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks Jeff. I'll go in reverse order. We're not providing additional guidance on timing for the Libre family of sensors at this point. We do feel good about the integration we have going with our RADIANT trial. And the customer experience on the RADIANT -- which is the Libre 2 integration that we're doing in Europe. The customer experience on the RADIANT trial has been terrific. And so, we're very bullish on that. And obviously to be in trial with that system we have to have a working integration. So, we're bullish on that, but we're not ready to provide timing on Libre for any specific markets at this moment. On the LMR question, it's a great question. We don't -- we think of LMR as exercises to test hypotheses and make sure the system is working the way we want it to. So we don't actually put a time line on it. We put a set of conditions on it. And so, as we get into market with LMR, we'll see what we see. Obviously, we wouldn't be going into LMR with the G7 integration, if we weren't confident that the system was working as expected. But with all of these things, you have to get the product out in a while to see how it performs. And so we'll get the LMR out there and we'll move as quickly as we can and we're really excited about bringing that G7 integration to market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMatt Taylor: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask you more about your efforts in type 2. Obviously, you're having some good success there today with 20% coming into the fold and that being a consistent level over time a healthy level. But I guess my question is, as you get the hopefully additional indications that are able to market, do you expect the proportion of type 2s to increase in the future? Maybe offer some thoughts on where that could go to. And also, could that even further broaden the prescriber base once you have that?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. Those are both great questions. First thing I'll say is, we're so strong in type 1, all right? So our offering in type 1 is bringing so many customers into the market from MDI that we expect to continue to drive penetration to the type one market and bring those customers who are currently not on a technology-based solution onto Pod therapy. And so -- and therefore that portion of the growth will continue. We're very bullish on growing MDI in type 1. Type two is a massively underpenetrated market. And we've been through the numbers on this a couple of times. And it's in our deck that we put up our investor deck that shows the market size for type two -- the progression of type two disease. But we've got 30-some-odd million people diagnosed with type 2 in the US who then progress on the basal and then on to intensive insulin therapy. Right now, there are about 2.5 million people in the US market who need intensive insulin as a part of their type two diabetes care. And they're just really underpenetrated as a market for pump therapy overall and therefore for Pod therapy. And we're very, very bullish on that. So if you think about -- we'll continue to penetrate type 1. Type two is actually a larger end market for intensive insulin therapy than type 1. So the proportion -- I do think to your point, the proportion will probably swing as we're able to get the indication for use and drive adoption in the market, but the numbers will go up. The total adoption number of customers will go up on both fronts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey this is Phil on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Just wait Jim, as we think about the key growth factors for the business being on the volume side of things, the ratio of MDI to conversions has marched from 50-40 to now 80-20 in the US. Are you seeing any kind of slowdown in your ability to convert competitive pumpers? Also, if you could provide that same ratio in OUS given the launch there, what does that MDI-to-conversion ratio look like in Europe?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Phil. The Q3 doesn't look hugely different from Q2 in terms of the mix of components of where customers are coming from. The only difference was -- and if I just back up, I'll go into the weeds for a second I apologize for going into the weeds. When we talk about sources of customers, whether it's type 1, type 2, MDI competitive conversion, we have different sources of data that allow us to estimate that including voluntary -- so when a customer enrolls on Omnipod, they will tell us where they're coming from usually. So it's voluntary information. It's not 100% data capture and what that means is there's a little bit of an estimation kind of range on those things. And so, Q3 compared to Q2 didn't look all that different. The only thing that looks different enough for us to change the number was competitive conversions went -- as you said, last quarter, we said it was 75-25. In this quarter, we said 80-20. But even that in terms of total number and range of estimate was not that huge a change. And we've been really happy with competitive conversions over the course of the launch of Omnipod 5. We're really clear at launch that the number, the volume of people converting from tubed pumps was a pleasant surprise for us. And we sustained that for a long time and probably a little longer on balance above historical trends of 80/20 sustained it for a little bit longer than we thought. So it's not really a surprise for us to get back to this 80/20 mix. And what it means is we continue to bring we're the clear market leader in bringing customers from MDI on to -- you could talk about again the broad category of AID but on to AID Pod therapy on Omnipod 5. We're the clear market leader in bringing MDI into the market and we're still taking share out of the installed base of tubed pumps. And so we don't really see anything in the data. And out in the market we see a lot of promotional activity. But we haven't -- our field is not really reporting any move that's making it harder for us in any way to convert people off of their tubed pump experience because Omnipod 5 and for that matter Omnipod DASH are so compelling. So that's maybe a long more in-the-weeds answer than you're looking for but that's how we see it. On the European side of the question, it's -- I think we're going to see that different market by market. And in fact in the UK what we see is different hospital by hospital. So in some instances, the NHS trust hospitals are tilting more towards new customer starts with Omnipod 5. And in some cases, they're tilting more towards upgrading from Omnipod DASH as a mix on balance more conversion than new customers start. A little bit of that is driven by physician preference and a little bit of that is driven by the hospital budget for the year. And so I think we'll see -- and I think it will look a little different in Germany and I think they'll look a little different as we get into other countries. As a reminder, the contracting in Europe locks everybody into a contract. So in the US we're in the pharmacy channel. It's easy to convert from a tubed pump on to Omnipod 5. In most of the European markets whether you're on an Omnipod DASH or you're on a tubed pump, you're locked into a contract for a period of time. And so for example in the UK it's at the discretion of the hospital to upgrade somebody to an Omnipod 5. And so that market behavior will look a little bit different market by market. What we do know is that Omnipod 5 is just -- the pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in our European markets is really strong and you can see the results already in the UK.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about Omnipod GO. I think you had mentioned that you're maybe seeing some pull-through in sales for the whole Omnipod family even early on. So is there any more detail around what you're seeing and how that relates maybe to the long-term commercial opportunity of a patient per account basis or however you look at it? And then as a follow-up, which I'll sneak through as you think about 2024 guidance, are you assuming any of that benefit from that pull-through direct sales from Omnipod 5? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks Margaret. I'll do them in reverse order. We haven't put anything formally into the guide out of the Omnipod GO pilot and we're still planning -- so this is not even yet a limited market release. It's a commercial pilot. And so we haven't tried to quantify that or include any of it into the color that Lauren provided or the guide. The pilot the -- I'm really pleased that we're piloting it in the way we are because we are doing exactly what we wanted, which is we're learning a lot. And it's I would say a pleasant surprise as we get into these PCP practices and talk to them about the offering that not only do they recognize the target patient profile for Omnipod GO as we characterize it. But as we explain Omnipod GO and they see the ease of use of Omnipod GO they ask us about the broader product portfolio. And I don't think we anticipated that that would be happening. And so it's -- and what it tells us is that Omnipod therapy genuinely is so simple to use that it should open up the conversation in primary care. What we're using the pilot for is to figure out what are the mechanics of that. So what does it look like? How many reps? What's the call pattern? What's in the bag? And we're testing things like the target patient profiles and things like that. And so I continue to think of it as early days but the learnings from the pilot have been really, really productive for us as we think about how to approach type 2 patients in the primary channel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is actually Anthony [ph] on for Joanne. Thanks for taking our question. Just a quick easy one here. I just want to confirm the $10 million this quarter that was associated with the Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics. I just want to confirm that was the tailwind. And then are you providing any guidance on what this number could be next year whether it's a tailwind or a headwind? Thank you.\nLauren Budden: Yes. So the $10 million is the double script phenomenon. And what's different now is that conversions is really a small component of that. So it's really immaterial. So going forward we expect the double script phenomenon to continue, but it's really just part of our normal growth rate going forward on new customer starts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nCaitlin Cronin: Hi. This is Caitlin Cronin on for Bill and congrats on a great quarter. Just to dig into US competition a little bit more it seems like there's been a few new entrants into the market this year and updates and potentially some early next year. How are you thinking about kind of the competitive landscape for tubed pumps and then also kind of for patch pumps in development going forward? Thank you.\nJim Hollingshead: Hi, Caitlin. We're very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 with G6 sensor is the best AID offering on the market. And what we see coming in competitor pipelines -- we think nothing in competitive pipeline is as good as Omnipod 5 with G6. And so -- and it doesn't mean that there won't be competition. As I said earlier, we see our competitors out there's a lot of promotional activity around from some of our competitors. So we see that out in the world. We haven't really seen it impact our results at this point. Now competition always -- I think -- first of all, I think, competition is great for business. It helps everybody learn and develop better products and it helps customers have better experience, which is what we're all trying to do. And so we know there's going to be competition. We know our competitors continue to try to innovate, but we're very, very confident in our competitive position and our growth profile. And that's why we're so excited about the growth catalysts we have coming in 2024. As to patch pump companies there's patch pumps -- we're the leader in patch pump. There's not really a viable patch pump competitor that we see on the horizon. And so that's another reason that we're very, very bullish on our position and expect to continue to lead the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Kratky from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nMike Kratky: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. So regarding the ongoing SECURE pivotal trial for Omnipod 5. How are you thinking about how that could impact the commercial opportunity for this product over the next few years? And what are the other main drivers that you expect to increase penetration within the insulin-intensive Type 2 patients that remain so underpenetrated?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks for the question. We're very excited about the SECURE trial. And as I said in our prepared comments, we've completed the goal for recruitment. And so just to be clear what that means that trial is designed to be up to 400 patients, but it has a minimum number of patients that are required. And so we crossed over the hurdle for the minimum number of patients. And the way to think about that is that it derisks the trial from an enrollment point of view. So we now are certain to have enough patients to successfully complete the trial. Enrollment is still open. So we'll continue to enroll some patients for the next little while because it's always better to have more patients in the trial rather than fewer. But -- so the trial is derisked operationally now with enough patients in to get a powered results that we need. And we'll continue the trial. And then it's a 13-week protocol. Once the last patient is in they'll complete the 13-week protocol. We'll gather the data, we'll clean the data, we'll prepare submission and so on. And then it will be in the hands of the FDA. And that will be a huge unlock for us in the Type 2 space. We're already the market leader in Type 2 with Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH has had an indication for use in Type 2 for some time. And we've been promoting Omnipod DASH for Type 2 this year. And you can see the results already. So if you saw quarter-over-quarter DASH actually did really well in the quarter, a little bit better than last quarter in terms of percent of revenue. And that's clearly because as we're out talking to physicians about Type 2 patients and Pod therapy we're driving growth in Type 2. We also know -- even though we cannot promote Omnipod 5 because it does not yet have an indication for use we do know that AID for people with Type 2 and specifically Omnipod 5 AID for people with Type 2 has very high appeal and physicians are writing it off label even though we're not promoting it. And so when you take those two things together the success of Omnipod DASH in the Type 2 market, the obvious pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in the type two market once we get the indication for use with a successful result from the SECURE trial we think it will unlock massive growth for us. That will come in the endocrinology channel. That's what we also think type 2 growth can come out of the PCP channel which is why we are piloting Omnipod GO in the PCP channel because it extends our reach upstream for type 2 patients, as they initiate insulin therapy with a basal offering. And then as they progress, they will already be on an Omnipod offering and they should pretty seamlessly progress onto either Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. So you mentioned earlier you're clearly moving your prescriber base past high-volume endos. Do you need to expand sort of your feet on the street meaningfully as this prescriber base continues to grow? Or are you seeing leverage opportunities from your current team?\nJim Hollingshead: Great question, Steve. And I would say two things on that front. The first one is, we are considering expanding feet on the street and that's part of the Omnipod GO commercial pilot to figure out how many feet on the street we need to get the reach that we want. The other thing is we get a lot of leverage out of DTP. And so a lot of the physicians that are writing for us, don't necessarily have a rep calling on them right now. And what's happening is our DTP advertising often reaches physicians by the way. So they often see the product through our online media or maybe on the TV ad, but patients go in and ask for Omnipod into those practices that we don't necessarily have a call routine with. So we're getting leverage in that way already. And then we will consider adding feet on the street as you say as appropriate over the coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. I just want to follow-up on the O5 type 2 opportunity. How are you thinking about the time line for FDA approval? And then also for presentation of that data - because it sounds like there's also already a fair amount of off-label interest. And it would seem like perhaps the data presentation itself could be a catalyst to spur even more interest before you actually get the labeling?\nJim Hollingshead: Great questions, Chris. First on timing, we haven't announced a formal time line on getting to an FDA clearance out of SECURE trial, but it's fairly easy to do the math. I think the last patient will probably be in no later than the end of the calendar year a 13-week protocol analyze the data to do a filing. So I think it's safe to say that, we'll be filing with the FDA in 2024 for sure for clearance. And then we'll see what happens in terms of -- each of those steps can have a plus or minus on the time line on them. But we expect to file next year for that. In between now and then there's a couple of things that are in terms of data on the study. We have published data out of our type 2 feasibility trial. And as we've referred to that in the context of the GLP-1 news that what we do see in -- out of our feasibility data is that the patients in that smallest trial who were also on GLP-1s actually did better on Omnipod 5 than patients not on GLP-1s and for reasons that we explained in the slides that we posted last quarter and that we've updated this week. And so GLP-1s make the body more sensitive to insulin and they reduced the required dose. And so the combination of the 2 actually ends up with a better outcome for patients which is interesting. And along those lines we anticipate that we will have a large number just about half plus or minus of the current enrollees in that trial are already on either an SGLT2 or a GLP-1. And so we anticipate being able to report out on subsets of the trial. That may happen -- it may happen before the FDA filing it may happen after but we anticipate being able to do some kind of scientific reporting on that as well during 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMarie Thibault: Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the iOS clearance. Just a quick one here on that. When might we see the G7 Omnipod five integrated with iOS as well just all the latest generation? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: We haven't guided the timing on that Marie. You can imagine that that's a very urgent matter for us to get to. But we'll do first things first. And so we'll get an LMR with iOS which will be a G6 offering initially. And we'll get into LMR G7 and then the two systems will come together after that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open \nQ \u2013 Josh Jennings: HI, good afternoon. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Wanted to follow up on Steve's question on the expanding prescriber base. Any chance, you can help us think through the penetration into the 7,000 to 8,000 US endocrinologists? And then of the additional prescribers, I guess if you're almost fully penetrated there 7,000 to 9,000? Are those -- some of those nurse, practitioners and endocrinology practices? Are they PCPs? Maybe just help us better understand where you're getting this prescriber expansion outside of endocrinology. Thanks a lot.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Josh. I'll provide -- we don't have perfect data on the specifics of your question, but we're very well penetrated with endocrinologists. We know that some of those prescribers are nurse practitioners and other care extenders, in endo practices. And then we know that some of the writers are PCPs or PAs attached to nonspecialist practices as well. But, I don't think -- I mean I'll turn to Lauren and/or Deb, to see if we have other color than that. That's the color I think we have.\nDeborah Gordon: No. This is Deb. That's the color that we have, Jim. It's great because, what we are seeing is we're seeing increases from all aspects. We're seeing increasing prescribers from endos, increasing prescribers from HCPs. And it's great that we also have PCPs, that are becoming aware of the system and prescribing it. So, we look at the trend data and we see it increasing over the last quarter and it's been great. So, we'll see where it goes from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open \nQ \u2013 Danielle Antalffy: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter. I guess my one question is a question I ask a lot, and that's around the primary care physician population here and just sort of what is was doing to ensure that they're appropriately servicing that prescribing base, because they do own the majority of the Type 2 so really executing upon that once you do get to Omnipod 5, Type 2, indication. And is it going to require you to add to the sales force? Or do you think you have enough to get to all the high-prescribing physicians? Thanks so much.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Danielle. Primary care physicians are really important in the Type 2 patient journey absolutely. And a couple of things, that we're doing there. One is, that's a main -- that's one of the main objectives of our Omnipod GO commercial pilot. We really want to understand better than we do right now, kind of in person what's going on in the primary care channel. And so the Omnipod GO commercial pilot has allowed us to get into a number of primary practices, present a target patient population of them, which we're finding is ringing true for them for the GO offering. And as I said earlier, it's really allowing us to see that -- primary practices, don't know much often about our portfolio products. And once we get in there they're very interested in our full portfolio including Omnipod DASH. And of course, we're not indicated for Omnipod 5, so we're not promoting it there. But it's giving us an opportunity to talk about the whole portfolio. And out of the pilot, we'll develop a better approach or find approach for how to commercialize into primary care. And there are several other options. The other thing, that that we see is that our DTP advertising or sorry direct-to-patient direct-to-consumer-type advertising, and our social media does tend to reach into the primary channel. So physicians, often see that media and patients often see the medium walk into their position and ask about it. So, we're getting leverage in that way as well. And I agree with you we need to really service type 2 patients. We need to find them where they are and very often where they are as in the primary channel.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. So, maybe just if you could with sort of the thinking of entering the basal market potentially on the other side of this, just give us a sense of your expectations there in terms of is this sort of attaching with relationships with patients potentially as they move into a more insulin-intensive clinical needs. Or is this a portion of that market that you feel -- I'm speaking beyond the sort of out-of-pocket interest that you've seen so far. But -- is there a portion of that market that you think is particularly attractive and maybe the size around that? Just sort of an update on your view as to what is that opportunity in addition of course being very large compared to the insulin-intensive opportunity? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks Matt. There are at least 3 million patients in the US who are on basal-only therapy. Some people say 4 million, so let's call it 3 million to 4 million people on basal-only insulin therapy who have type 2 diabetes in the US. Really only a small penetration in that market helps meaningful with our growth trajectory because our aim is to not only serve those patients but to introduce the Omnipod family of products to them such that when their disease progresses, which is essentially inevitable, as their disease progresses, we have a relationship with them. We're helping with the therapy early and then we stay -- they stay with us, we stay with them as their disease progresses. The target patient population there is -- there's a lot of people there and there's a lot of offerings in there. There's people on MDI. We've been asked before and we're conscious of the fact that the insulin companies are looking to launch once-a-week insulin, which will be a type of therapy in that market. We think there's a lot of room in that market for different offerings. And for us there's some clear benefits that we bring to market with Omnipod GO, which include there's no needles. So, there's a very significant percentage of patients don't want to do an injectable therapy because they don't like needles. And then the other thing is people forget to take their care. They forget to take their insulin. And so we think that we solve both of these problems for both patients and their physicians and that's what we're testing out in our commercial pilot. So, we think there is a meaningful market there for us for Omnipod GO with basal-only therapy. And importantly, we think when we get to those patients and help them early in their patient journey, we can help them throughout their patient journey. And eventually many of them will end up on Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. And so that's the theory of the case. It's both end. It's a meaningful market for us is a basal market. And it's early customer acquisition if you think about it that way early in the patient lifecycle, which helps us to acquire those patients much further upstream.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you everybody for joining us today. We're really excited to have delivered another outstanding quarter for Insulet with our Omnipod family of products, clearly driving growth and have great momentum in the type 1 market, both in the US and now excited internationally, as we've launched Omnipod 5 in the UK and Germany and are on track to deliver in other international markets. Clearly, leading the market in type 2, which is a very exciting development for us. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication and for their focus on mission because it's helped us to get out and continue to reach all the people out there that we've reached helping them simplify their lives with diabetes. There are millions of people around the world that we intend to help and we're well on track to do that. Thanks everybody for joining us today and have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for Insulet with rapid growth and achievement of many strategic milestones. Thanks to our global team's execution, dedication and focus we are on track to complete another transformational year and enter 2024 with significant momentum. On today's call, I want to do three things; discuss our financial results and market traction provide an update on our continuing progress in clinical and market access work, and review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our third quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of over 27% including US growth of 35%. We also achieved total company growth of 25%. These are remarkable results especially coming in the context of our strong prior year comparables. As a result, we raised guidance once again for the full year. Performance was driven primarily by the huge success of Omnipod 5, our revolutionary automated insulin delivery system. It is gratifying to see the positive impact Omnipod 5 is having as it continues to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes and we are only in the early innings. Q3 represented the anniversary of the US launch of our Omnipod 5 platform. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA-cleared fully disposable pod-based AID system and it continues to transform diabetes management. Its simplicity, ease of use, widespread and affordable access and improved real-world outcomes have made Omnipod 5, the leading AID offering on the market. With the added benefits of US pharmacy channel access pay-as-you-go model and an easy onboarding pathway, Omnipod 5 makes it simple and efficient for health care practitioners, patients and payers to conveniently prescribe access and afford our breakthrough technology. We are now also beginning the global rollout of Omnipod 5 in our international markets starting with the UK this past June. With one full quarter under our belts in the UK we are seeing very strong early adoption. In Q3, Omnipod 5 drove accelerated new customer starts in the UK taking revenue growth to almost 45% year-over-year and driving approximately 70% sequential growth in new customer starts. It's a strong early sign of the global power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes care. During Q3, we also commenced the rollout of Omnipod 5 in Germany in August and early momentum is exciting. Based on these results, we are confident that Omnipod 5 will emerge as the market-leading offer everywhere it is available. The success of Omnipod 5 led to another outstanding quarter of new customer starts both in the US and globally. In the US, Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q3 and customer retention remains strong. In the US in Q3, Omnipod new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 80-20 percentage split which is in line with our historical mix. Omnipod was specifically designed for individuals on MDI and as expected, we are driving pump penetration across all age groups in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, while also growing our share positioning Insulet as a leader in these markets. We estimate that we are the clear leader bringing customers into the market from MDI. In addition to growing awareness of Omnipod and high product demand among patients, a growing number of HCPs are writing scripts for it. In Q3, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 17,000 up from over 15,000 in Q2. In a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists this shows the broad appeal and ease of prescription of Omnipod 5. Importantly, this extensive reach is critical to access patients who are not seen at the high-volume pump-prescribing clinics that historically defines the pump market. Omnipod 5's broad appeal is also evidenced by the growing number of scripts that these HCPs write for our system. Omnipod loyalty amongst Podders has been a hallmark of our brand for many years and it is great to see the growing demand and confidence amongst the prescribing HCPs. In fact an increasing number tell us that when given the choice their patients overwhelmingly choose Omnipod. Our results in Q3 also strengthen our conviction that we'll be able to reach the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy as a part of their care. In the quarter, Omnipod adoption in the Type 2 market continued at a steady pace with Type 2 patients representing approximately 20% of our US new customer starts. These new customer starts come from across our Omnipod portfolio of products, demonstrating the clear benefits that our products offer the Type 2 population. Omnipod DASH continues to be the leading insulin pump offer with an indication for use in the Type 2 market. While we can't yet market Omnipod 5 for Type 2, the obvious underlying demand for AID in the Type 2 market is encouraging. And we look forward to bringing Omnipod 5 to these customers once we complete our pivotal trial and secure an extension to our existing indication for use. And to that end, we are very excited to announce that we have reached our enrollment goal this week in our US Type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this is a study of up to 400 participants with a 13-week protocol comparing Omnipod 5 to participants' previous therapy. The feedback from HCPs and study participants continues to be very strong and strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will have a big impact in the critically underserved population of Type 2 patients who require insulin. We will provide further updates as the trial progresses. I'd like to make a few comments about the ongoing debate about the impact of GLP-1s on our markets. As we've made clear, we regard the GLP-1 class of drugs as an important innovation for people with Type 2 diabetes and they have been indicated for use in Type 2 diabetes for several years. These drugs help many of the same patients we aim to help and we applaud their innovation. Further as a reminder, we believe GLP-1s do not materially impact our end markets. They are not indicated for use in Type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune disorder and there is no apparent mechanism for them to impact the course of type one as a condition. Likewise, there is no apparent mechanism for GLP-1 drugs to alter the underlying progression of beta cell decline that is characteristic of Type 2 diabetes. Last month we published a short slide presentation going into these issues in more detail. This week we published an update to those slides based upon data that was recently presented at EASD. In a large retrospective study of 23,000 users of semaglutide, the evidence presented suggests three important conclusions. First, semaglutide has almost identical impact on glycemic control as liraglutide in terms of the magnitude and duration of A1c reduction. Second, this real-world evidence shows a very clear relationship between dose adherence and glycemic control such that only the most adherent users receive the level of benefit that has been demonstrated in more controlled clinical settings. Finally and importantly, weight loss and the persistence of weight loss for semaglutide users in this study was demonstrated to be independent of glycemic control. In short, real-world evidence shows that patients using semaglutide continue to have their diabetes progress with limited or no incremental duration of effect over previous drugs and type 2 diabetes continues to progress even with weight loss. For those who are interested in more detail, we refer you to our updated presentation which is available on the Insulet Investor page. These data reinforce our existing view. Because the underlying disease continues to progress most people with type 2 diabetes will eventually need to incorporate insulin into their therapy. Insulet is incredibly well-positioned to serve these customers as they progress in their condition and need to add first basal and then intensive insulin into their treatment. We are already winning in this market and we continue to have strong conviction that people with type 2 diabetes represent a large and underserved population. We are continuing our efforts to bring the full power of a broad portfolio of insulin delivery options including Omnipod DASH, Omnipod 5, and Omnipod GO, which I will come back to in a few moments. In addition to our type 2 pivotal trial, we are progressing several additional clinical initiatives. We are pleased to have completed the protocol with the last participant in our randomized controlled trial using Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6. We're in the process of analyzing and preparing the data, which we expect to show the clear benefits of Omnipod 5 therapy over non-AID systems. We are also making great progress with the RADIANT study which is our Libre 2 Integration trial, for which we began enrollment in September. Clinicians have remarked about the simplicity and ease of transition for MDI users to Omnipod 5 in the outpatient setting including in regions where it is often the norm for AID therapy to occur in the hospital for days due to the complexity of existing tubed pump offerings. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre 2 sensor has advanced to the point where study participants are using the system. Both of these studies will provide the evidence we need to drive pricing and market access initiatives as we launch Omnipod 5 across our international markets. I'd now like to turn to three key areas of innovation for us; expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod GO, and driving the future of AID with our advanced algorithm program. The widespread success of Omnipod 5 makes it easy to forget that the current version of our offering is in some ways our minimum viable product. In order to achieve the full promise of the platform, our aim is to expand on customer choice, both for phone control and for CGM use. In that context, we are excited to have received FDA clearance for our 510(k) for the Omnipod iOS app. This is another major innovation milestone for Insulet and iOS is one of the most requested features from our customers. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to provide the iOS option to our existing Omnipod 5 customer base as well as future customers. Because the iOS app represents a completely new software platform we expect to begin a US limited market release in early 2024. And upon successful completion, we will make iOS for Omnipod 5 broadly available as soon as possible. With regard to CGM, our efforts to expand our sensor integrations with our partners, Dexcom and Abbott, continue to steadily progress. I've already mentioned our progress with Libre sensor integration in the context of our European trial. We are also hard at work to complete our integration with Dexcom's G7 sensor and we are excited to announce that we are planning for a limited market release of Omnipod 5 plus G7 also in early 2024. Omnipod 5 is the market-leading offer and with these coming innovations, we are confident we will be able to maintain and extend that leadership. A key innovation effort that moves us upstream from AID is Omnipod GO, which is designed to radically simplify the initiation of basal insulin therapy for people who need to start insulin as their type 2 diabetes progresses. Even small penetration into this market will meaningfully contribute to our long-term growth trajectory. We have commenced the commercial pilot for Omnipod GO in the US, which includes HCPs that we don't typically call on who are new to Omnipod most of whom who are primary care physicians. Our commercial pilot is providing us with the opportunity to present Omnipod GO and also to educate PCPs on all of our Omnipod offerings. Although early in our pilot, PCPs are telling us that Pod therapy is much easier than pump therapy. As a result these HCPs want to learn about the entire Omnipod portfolio. We expect both Omnipod GO and Omnipod DASH to make the treatment pathway far easier for these type 2 patients. Learnings from our ongoing Omnipod GO commercial, pilot will help us to refine our plans for commercialization in 2024. We are continuing to progress work on our next-generation AID algorithm with our Evolution feasibility trial which we began earlier in the year and which is being conducted in New Zealand. The goal of this feasibility study is to test potential enhancements to the Omnipod 5 algorithm in order to further drive simplicity of use. We've been able to launch this study very early in the life cycle of our AID offerings, specifically because of the unique aspects of Omnipod 5, both because the on-market algorithm is highly effective and because of our ability to gather actual usage data from essentially the entire population of Omnipod 5 users. We expect that cloud connectivity for -- of Omnipod 5 coupled with our data sciences capabilities will allow us to materially accelerate our algorithm development efforts over time. Finally, an important update on our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. In August, we filed a suit in the US against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the misappropriation of Insulet's proprietary trade secrets. Last month, after requesting preliminary relief and obtaining some initial evidence, the court granted our request for a preliminary injunction against EOFlow, which prohibits EOFlow from manufacturing marketing or selling to any new customer any product that we designed developed or manufactured using or relying on Insulet's trade secrets. The court also extended the prior injunction issue to restrain EOFlow from disclosing to any third party information that contains derives from or incorporates Insulet's confidential information. In granting Insulet's motion the court found \"very substantial indeed strong evidence of misappropriation\" and \"that Insulet is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secrets claim.\" We have invested considerable resources over many years developing our Omnipod products and we are confident we have a clear lead technically and in terms of scalability. We will continue to vigorously defend our IP to protect those investments. In closing, we completed another outstanding quarter and we have sustained momentum across our business. We are enjoying continued rapid growth in the US type 1 market and we're seeing accelerating adoption in our international markets where Omnipod 5 is launched. We are also seeing continued growth in the type 2 market across our Omnipod offerings. We are excited about the catalysts coming in 2024 with iOS functionality CGM-integrated Omnipod GO that unlock a lot of market growth for many years to come. I want to thank our entire Insulet global team for their engagement and hard work as we continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. Before I turn the call over to Lauren, I want to welcome and congratulate her on her role as our Interim CFO and Treasurer. Lauren is our Chief Accounting Officer and has been with Insulet for close to five years. She has long been a key member of our finance team and has contributed significant value to the company and to shareholders during her tenure with us. We are thrilled to have Lauren in this role to support our continued execution of our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren. Thanks Rohan. We're really excited about the growth catalysts that we have coming. We've obviously got great momentum continuing to drive really strong demand and new customer starts in the market really well positioned. And we're very excited about getting into the limited market releases for both iOS and G7 early in the year and also really excited about continuing progress with the Libre integration. So we think they do drive continued growth for us. And in terms of the guide we haven't really guided on the number for that. It's really in our color. But we do think it opens up a lot of potential growth for us across the board. They're all important. And I wouldn't want to necessarily weigh one over the other so we think they all drive catalyst. But I'll ask Lauren and Deb if they want to add any color to that. New customer starts were really strong not quite a record. And so second we're not we don't want to get in the table ranking all of our quarters all the time, but it was our second-highest quarter ever of new customer starts just coming in behind. Q2 was kind of a blowout quarter for us in new customer starts where everything hit on every cylinder. So really happy with the new customer starts, but not quite a record. Sure Charles. First of all we're really happy to have Lauren in the chair. She's been with us for a long time. She's such a great contributor to the company and to our senior finance team and really blessed to have somebody of Lauren's caliber to step in in this interim. And we're conducting a search. We're just out of the market now with the search. We've written the spec. And I don't really want to talk about the characteristics and so on that we're looking for. We think that the CFO job here is a really fun job. We have internal candidates who are really strong including Lauren and early look at the market looks really promising. We want to move as quickly as we can because we want to get to some stability there. But we're very confident we'll get the right person in the role. Thanks Stephanie. I'll turn to Lauren on that. Go ahead. Sorry Lauren. Go ahead, go ahead. Hi Jayson. [Indiscernible] So yeah, no we haven't changed our marketing message at all. The Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod DASH are so effective in insulin delivery. The pilot with The Omnipod 5 Pod though is -- we're learning a lot. It's going well. And GLP-1s are out there. GLP-1 has been indicated for some time in the market. And so we haven't changed our messaging. I think that we continue to learn about GLP-1s. And if we need to adapt our messaging we will. But we haven't had to change our messaging and we continue to obviously have a lot of success. Can you remind me of the second part of your question there, Jayson? I'm not sure I would jump to that split. Go ahead. Go ahead, Lauren. Thanks. Yeah, we're so excited about getting Omnipod 5 into multiple markets in Europe. As we said -- as we detailed in the prepared remarks the U.K. launch is going really well. Germany is strong out of the gate. In direct answer to your question we don't see any barriers to driving really strong and robust growth where we launch Omnipod 5. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks we're very confident it's going to be a leading offer wherever we're able to put it in the market. So it's such a great solution it's so easy for customers to use. It drives such great real-world results. And as we get more evidence and we can drive access conversations we're also confident we can get a price premium for the value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so we're all systems -- full speed ahead in getting into our international markets with Omnipod 5. Yes. Thanks Jeff. I'll go in reverse order. We're not providing additional guidance on timing for the Libre family of sensors at this point. We do feel good about the integration we have going with our RADIANT trial. And the customer experience on the RADIANT -- which is the Libre 2 integration that we're doing in Europe. The customer experience on the RADIANT trial has been terrific. And so, we're very bullish on that. And obviously to be in trial with that system we have to have a working integration. So, we're bullish on that, but we're not ready to provide timing on Libre for any specific markets at this moment. On the LMR question, it's a great question. We don't -- we think of LMR as exercises to test hypotheses and make sure the system is working the way we want it to. So we don't actually put a time line on it. We put a set of conditions on it. And so, as we get into market with LMR, we'll see what we see. Obviously, we wouldn't be going into LMR with the G7 integration, if we weren't confident that the system was working as expected. But with all of these things, you have to get the product out in a while to see how it performs. And so we'll get the LMR out there and we'll move as quickly as we can and we're really excited about bringing that G7 integration to market. Thanks, Matt. Those are both great questions. First thing I'll say is, we're so strong in type 1, all right? So our offering in type 1 is bringing so many customers into the market from MDI that we expect to continue to drive penetration to the type one market and bring those customers who are currently not on a technology-based solution onto Pod therapy. And so -- and therefore that portion of the growth will continue. We're very bullish on growing MDI in type 1. Type two is a massively underpenetrated market. And we've been through the numbers on this a couple of times. And it's in our deck that we put up our investor deck that shows the market size for type two -- the progression of type two disease. But we've got 30-some-odd million people diagnosed with type 2 in the US who then progress on the basal and then on to intensive insulin therapy. Right now, there are about 2.5 million people in the US market who need intensive insulin as a part of their type two diabetes care. And they're just really underpenetrated as a market for pump therapy overall and therefore for Pod therapy. And we're very, very bullish on that. So if you think about -- we'll continue to penetrate type 1. Type two is actually a larger end market for intensive insulin therapy than type 1. So the proportion -- I do think to your point, the proportion will probably swing as we're able to get the indication for use and drive adoption in the market, but the numbers will go up. The total adoption number of customers will go up on both fronts. Thanks, Phil. The Q3 doesn't look hugely different from Q2 in terms of the mix of components of where customers are coming from. The only difference was -- and if I just back up, I'll go into the weeds for a second I apologize for going into the weeds. When we talk about sources of customers, whether it's type 1, type 2, MDI competitive conversion, we have different sources of data that allow us to estimate that including voluntary -- so when a customer enrolls on Omnipod, they will tell us where they're coming from usually. So it's voluntary information. It's not 100% data capture and what that means is there's a little bit of an estimation kind of range on those things. And so, Q3 compared to Q2 didn't look all that different. The only thing that looks different enough for us to change the number was competitive conversions went -- as you said, last quarter, we said it was 75-25. In this quarter, we said 80-20. But even that in terms of total number and range of estimate was not that huge a change. And we've been really happy with competitive conversions over the course of the launch of Omnipod 5. We're really clear at launch that the number, the volume of people converting from tubed pumps was a pleasant surprise for us. And we sustained that for a long time and probably a little longer on balance above historical trends of 80/20 sustained it for a little bit longer than we thought. So it's not really a surprise for us to get back to this 80/20 mix. And what it means is we continue to bring we're the clear market leader in bringing customers from MDI on to -- you could talk about again the broad category of AID but on to AID Pod therapy on Omnipod 5. We're the clear market leader in bringing MDI into the market and we're still taking share out of the installed base of tubed pumps. And so we don't really see anything in the data. And out in the market we see a lot of promotional activity. But we haven't -- our field is not really reporting any move that's making it harder for us in any way to convert people off of their tubed pump experience because Omnipod 5 and for that matter Omnipod DASH are so compelling. So that's maybe a long more in-the-weeds answer than you're looking for but that's how we see it. On the European side of the question, it's -- I think we're going to see that different market by market. And in fact in the UK what we see is different hospital by hospital. So in some instances, the NHS trust hospitals are tilting more towards new customer starts with Omnipod 5. And in some cases, they're tilting more towards upgrading from Omnipod DASH as a mix on balance more conversion than new customers start. A little bit of that is driven by physician preference and a little bit of that is driven by the hospital budget for the year. And so I think we'll see -- and I think it will look a little different in Germany and I think they'll look a little different as we get into other countries. As a reminder, the contracting in Europe locks everybody into a contract. So in the US we're in the pharmacy channel. It's easy to convert from a tubed pump on to Omnipod 5. In most of the European markets whether you're on an Omnipod DASH or you're on a tubed pump, you're locked into a contract for a period of time. And so for example in the UK it's at the discretion of the hospital to upgrade somebody to an Omnipod 5. And so that market behavior will look a little bit different market by market. What we do know is that Omnipod 5 is just -- the pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in our European markets is really strong and you can see the results already in the UK. Thanks Margaret. I'll do them in reverse order. We haven't put anything formally into the guide out of the Omnipod GO pilot and we're still planning -- so this is not even yet a limited market release. It's a commercial pilot. And so we haven't tried to quantify that or include any of it into the color that Lauren provided or the guide. The pilot the -- I'm really pleased that we're piloting it in the way we are because we are doing exactly what we wanted, which is we're learning a lot. And it's I would say a pleasant surprise as we get into these PCP practices and talk to them about the offering that not only do they recognize the target patient profile for Omnipod GO as we characterize it. But as we explain Omnipod GO and they see the ease of use of Omnipod GO they ask us about the broader product portfolio. And I don't think we anticipated that that would be happening. And so it's -- and what it tells us is that Omnipod therapy genuinely is so simple to use that it should open up the conversation in primary care. What we're using the pilot for is to figure out what are the mechanics of that. So what does it look like? How many reps? What's the call pattern? What's in the bag? And we're testing things like the target patient profiles and things like that. And so I continue to think of it as early days but the learnings from the pilot have been really, really productive for us as we think about how to approach type 2 patients in the primary channel. Hi, Caitlin. We're very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 with G6 sensor is the best AID offering on the market. And what we see coming in competitor pipelines -- we think nothing in competitive pipeline is as good as Omnipod 5 with G6. And so -- and it doesn't mean that there won't be competition. As I said earlier, we see our competitors out there's a lot of promotional activity around from some of our competitors. So we see that out in the world. We haven't really seen it impact our results at this point. Now competition always -- I think -- first of all, I think, competition is great for business. It helps everybody learn and develop better products and it helps customers have better experience, which is what we're all trying to do. And so we know there's going to be competition. We know our competitors continue to try to innovate, but we're very, very confident in our competitive position and our growth profile. And that's why we're so excited about the growth catalysts we have coming in 2024. As to patch pump companies there's patch pumps -- we're the leader in patch pump. There's not really a viable patch pump competitor that we see on the horizon. And so that's another reason that we're very, very bullish on our position and expect to continue to lead the market. Thanks for the question. We're very excited about the SECURE trial. And as I said in our prepared comments, we've completed the goal for recruitment. And so just to be clear what that means that trial is designed to be up to 400 patients, but it has a minimum number of patients that are required. And so we crossed over the hurdle for the minimum number of patients. And the way to think about that is that it derisks the trial from an enrollment point of view. So we now are certain to have enough patients to successfully complete the trial. Enrollment is still open. So we'll continue to enroll some patients for the next little while because it's always better to have more patients in the trial rather than fewer. But -- so the trial is derisked operationally now with enough patients in to get a powered results that we need. And we'll continue the trial. And then it's a 13-week protocol. Once the last patient is in they'll complete the 13-week protocol. We'll gather the data, we'll clean the data, we'll prepare submission and so on. And then it will be in the hands of the FDA. And that will be a huge unlock for us in the Type 2 space. We're already the market leader in Type 2 with Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH has had an indication for use in Type 2 for some time. And we've been promoting Omnipod DASH for Type 2 this year. And you can see the results already. So if you saw quarter-over-quarter DASH actually did really well in the quarter, a little bit better than last quarter in terms of percent of revenue. And that's clearly because as we're out talking to physicians about Type 2 patients and Pod therapy we're driving growth in Type 2. We also know -- even though we cannot promote Omnipod 5 because it does not yet have an indication for use we do know that AID for people with Type 2 and specifically Omnipod 5 AID for people with Type 2 has very high appeal and physicians are writing it off label even though we're not promoting it. And so when you take those two things together the success of Omnipod DASH in the Type 2 market, the obvious pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in the type two market once we get the indication for use with a successful result from the SECURE trial we think it will unlock massive growth for us. That will come in the endocrinology channel. That's what we also think type 2 growth can come out of the PCP channel which is why we are piloting Omnipod GO in the PCP channel because it extends our reach upstream for type 2 patients, as they initiate insulin therapy with a basal offering. And then as they progress, they will already be on an Omnipod offering and they should pretty seamlessly progress onto either Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. Great question, Steve. And I would say two things on that front. The first one is, we are considering expanding feet on the street and that's part of the Omnipod GO commercial pilot to figure out how many feet on the street we need to get the reach that we want. The other thing is we get a lot of leverage out of DTP. And so a lot of the physicians that are writing for us, don't necessarily have a rep calling on them right now. And what's happening is our DTP advertising often reaches physicians by the way. So they often see the product through our online media or maybe on the TV ad, but patients go in and ask for Omnipod into those practices that we don't necessarily have a call routine with. So we're getting leverage in that way already. And then we will consider adding feet on the street as you say as appropriate over the coming quarters. Great questions, Chris. First on timing, we haven't announced a formal time line on getting to an FDA clearance out of SECURE trial, but it's fairly easy to do the math. I think the last patient will probably be in no later than the end of the calendar year a 13-week protocol analyze the data to do a filing. So I think it's safe to say that, we'll be filing with the FDA in 2024 for sure for clearance. And then we'll see what happens in terms of -- each of those steps can have a plus or minus on the time line on them. But we expect to file next year for that. In between now and then there's a couple of things that are in terms of data on the study. We have published data out of our type 2 feasibility trial. And as we've referred to that in the context of the GLP-1 news that what we do see in -- out of our feasibility data is that the patients in that smallest trial who were also on GLP-1s actually did better on Omnipod 5 than patients not on GLP-1s and for reasons that we explained in the slides that we posted last quarter and that we've updated this week. And so GLP-1s make the body more sensitive to insulin and they reduced the required dose. And so the combination of the 2 actually ends up with a better outcome for patients which is interesting. And along those lines we anticipate that we will have a large number just about half plus or minus of the current enrollees in that trial are already on either an SGLT2 or a GLP-1. And so we anticipate being able to report out on subsets of the trial. That may happen -- it may happen before the FDA filing it may happen after but we anticipate being able to do some kind of scientific reporting on that as well during 2024. We haven't guided the timing on that Marie. You can imagine that that's a very urgent matter for us to get to. But we'll do first things first. And so we'll get an LMR with iOS which will be a G6 offering initially. And we'll get into LMR G7 and then the two systems will come together after that. Thanks, Josh. I'll provide -- we don't have perfect data on the specifics of your question, but we're very well penetrated with endocrinologists. We know that some of those prescribers are nurse practitioners and other care extenders, in endo practices. And then we know that some of the writers are PCPs or PAs attached to nonspecialist practices as well. But, I don't think -- I mean I'll turn to Lauren and/or Deb, to see if we have other color than that. That's the color I think we have. Thanks, Danielle. Primary care physicians are really important in the Type 2 patient journey absolutely. And a couple of things, that we're doing there. One is, that's a main -- that's one of the main objectives of our Omnipod GO commercial pilot. We really want to understand better than we do right now, kind of in person what's going on in the primary care channel. And so the Omnipod GO commercial pilot has allowed us to get into a number of primary practices, present a target patient population of them, which we're finding is ringing true for them for the GO offering. And as I said earlier, it's really allowing us to see that -- primary practices, don't know much often about our portfolio products. And once we get in there they're very interested in our full portfolio including Omnipod DASH. And of course, we're not indicated for Omnipod 5, so we're not promoting it there. But it's giving us an opportunity to talk about the whole portfolio. And out of the pilot, we'll develop a better approach or find approach for how to commercialize into primary care. And there are several other options. The other thing, that that we see is that our DTP advertising or sorry direct-to-patient direct-to-consumer-type advertising, and our social media does tend to reach into the primary channel. So physicians, often see that media and patients often see the medium walk into their position and ask about it. So, we're getting leverage in that way as well. And I agree with you we need to really service type 2 patients. We need to find them where they are and very often where they are as in the primary channel. Yes. Thanks Matt. There are at least 3 million patients in the US who are on basal-only therapy. Some people say 4 million, so let's call it 3 million to 4 million people on basal-only insulin therapy who have type 2 diabetes in the US. Really only a small penetration in that market helps meaningful with our growth trajectory because our aim is to not only serve those patients but to introduce the Omnipod family of products to them such that when their disease progresses, which is essentially inevitable, as their disease progresses, we have a relationship with them. We're helping with the therapy early and then we stay -- they stay with us, we stay with them as their disease progresses. The target patient population there is -- there's a lot of people there and there's a lot of offerings in there. There's people on MDI. We've been asked before and we're conscious of the fact that the insulin companies are looking to launch once-a-week insulin, which will be a type of therapy in that market. We think there's a lot of room in that market for different offerings. And for us there's some clear benefits that we bring to market with Omnipod GO, which include there's no needles. So, there's a very significant percentage of patients don't want to do an injectable therapy because they don't like needles. And then the other thing is people forget to take their care. They forget to take their insulin. And so we think that we solve both of these problems for both patients and their physicians and that's what we're testing out in our commercial pilot. So, we think there is a meaningful market there for us for Omnipod GO with basal-only therapy. And importantly, we think when we get to those patients and help them early in their patient journey, we can help them throughout their patient journey. And eventually many of them will end up on Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. And so that's the theory of the case. It's both end. It's a meaningful market for us is a basal market. And it's early customer acquisition if you think about it that way early in the patient lifecycle, which helps us to acquire those patients much further upstream. Thank you everybody for joining us today. We're really excited to have delivered another outstanding quarter for Insulet with our Omnipod family of products, clearly driving growth and have great momentum in the type 1 market, both in the US and now excited internationally, as we've launched Omnipod 5 in the UK and Germany and are on track to deliver in other international markets. Clearly, leading the market in type 2, which is a very exciting development for us. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication and for their focus on mission because it's helped us to get out and continue to reach all the people out there that we've reached helping them simplify their lives with diabetes. There are millions of people around the world that we intend to help and we're well on track to do that. Thanks everybody for joining us today and have a good evening."

            "name": "Lauren Budden",
            "content": "Thanks so much, Jim. It's an honor to serve as interim CFO. As Jim shared, Insulin achieved another quarter of robust growth financial performance and strategic progress. We once again delivered strong global new customer starts fueled by huge demand for Omnipod 5 in the US. And we are seeing a very nice uptick in new customer starts in the international markets where we launched Omnipod 5. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 25% revenue growth in Q3, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of over 27%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 180 basis point tailwind compared to Q3 last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 35% and exceeded our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing US pharmacy volume. This includes an increase in volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH and the related premium for Pods in the US pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a competitive advantage and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q3 represented between 90% and 95% of our total US volume. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net tailwind of approximately $10 million, which is in line with what we expected for Q3 guidance. As a reminder, since our launch, we have realized a recurring net volume benefit from new customers as well as from Omnipod customers converting to Omnipod 5, many of whom received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter plus some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Our estimates have been net of those Omnipod 5 customers who skipped an order in the period. In Q3, as we expected, the volume benefit from conversions has been normalizing and was therefore immaterial as the majority of our existing customers already switched to Omnipod 5. Going forward, we expect continued benefit from the two script dynamics, as we drive Omnipod 5 new customer starts. In Q3, US attrition and global utilization remained stable. International Omnipod revenue increased 8%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree incremental benefit from our Omnipod 5 launch in the UK, which drove a notable increase in new customer starts. These benefits were partially offset by slightly higher attrition as we continue to be impacted by AID competition including lower distributor orders. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 720 basis point tailwind over the prior year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 27%, which was slightly below our guidance range, due to a lower forecast from our partners. Gross margin was 67.8%, up over 1,200 basis points and included income of $1.9 million due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year when we took a charge of approximately $37 million in Q3 last year. Excluding both, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 67.3% in Q3 of this year. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. These increases were partially offset by expected higher production costs as US manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses were up year-over-year in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin was 12.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 19.1%. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $1.9 million and were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $685 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our innovation pipeline and other key areas of our organization in order to build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 29% to 30% and total company revenue growth to a range of 26% to 27%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to a range of 37% to 38%. This increase is primarily driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption stemming from consecutive strong new customer starts and to a lesser extent ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as from recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q4 of last year was the first full quarter of Omnipod 5 sales contributing to a tougher comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. The prior year included the two-script benefit, which was in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. It also included retail channel stocking. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance range and now expect 9% to 10% growth. On a reported basis we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 100 basis points. We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption as well as the benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model we expect Omnipod 5 to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our guidance range of a 45% to 50% decline. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We are raising our adjusted gross margin expectations to a range of 66% to 67% and expect to achieve the midpoint of this range. The increase from our prior guide is driven by improved manufacturing costs as well as higher-than-expected revenue including favorable mix. Although certain headwinds that we experienced during 2023 will carry over into next year, we expect to see further gross margin improvement in 2024. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 9% to 10% given our revenue and gross margin outperformance. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. Turning to our fourth quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod and total company growth of 22% to 25%. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 28% to 31%. Even with the challenging comp due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of last year our new customers start momentum and the benefits of our annuity model continue to fuel our revenue growth, including strong expected sequential dollar growth in Q4. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 300 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $5 million due to timing of production and orders. We have sustained momentum across our business and we are poised for another strong year in 2024. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our Q4 call in February, I will provide some color now on how we are thinking about 2024 given the strong momentum we see in the business. We anticipate another year of large dollar growth in 2024, even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023 from our Omnipod 5 ramp. For US Omnipod, we expect a growth rate within the mid-20% range, fueled by Omnipod 5 and its strong pace of new customer starts as well as our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. For International, we expect continued growth with Omnipod DASH and more meaningful growth towards the second half of the year from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. All in, that puts us somewhere in the high single digits for the year with the second half of the year accelerating to a range of high single digits to low double-digits. For Drug Delivery, we expect to see a decline and at the high end of the forecast, we expect the decline to be lower than in 2023. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of solid financial performance and we further positioned Insulet for continued momentum through the end of this year and beyond. As we continue to capitalize on the global market opportunity and invest in innovation, we're poised for another strong year of customer base growth and revenue growth. Opportunities of this magnitude are few and far between, and we are very well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Sure. Thanks, Jim. So yes we have factored them in. But given our annuity model as Jim said it's not expected to be a meaningful contribution. And we're just entering in LMR in the beginning of the year. Yeah. So... So we're not providing guidance today. But just a little colour we are committed to expanding our margins. We're thrilled that we increased gross margins for the full year of 2023 to 66% to 67%. And we are also very thrilled that we increased the high-end of our operating margin guidance range as well. So we're very focused on increasing those and we would expect that trend to continue going forward as well. I was just going to say it grew about the same. Yes. So the $10 million is the double script phenomenon. And what's different now is that conversions is really a small component of that. So it's really immaterial. So going forward we expect the double script phenomenon to continue, but it's really just part of our normal growth rate going forward on new customer starts."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you joining us for Insulet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our second quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.  Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange.  These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis, with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, we enjoyed another quarter of sustained strong momentum, and we remain on track for another successful and transformative year. The entire global Insulet team is executing at a high level, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance while also achieving several key strategic and innovation milestones.  On today's call, I'll touch on 4 main topics: our strong financial performance, our consumer-focused innovation and clinical achievements, how we're continuing to drive penetration of a massive market opportunity with expanded access and awareness and the Omnipod 5 international launch.  Starting with our financial performance. Our second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 33%, including U.S. growth of 41%. We also achieved total company growth of 32%. Because of these terrific results, we've raised our outlook for the year.  Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology market as the only FDA-approved fully disposable, pod-based automated insulin delivery system. Our flagship offering continues to be the major driver of U.S. revenue growth and was responsible for another record quarter of U.S. and global new customer starts. And Omnipod 5 represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts.  Building on our success in the U.S., we are very pleased to have completed the commercial launch of Omnipod 5 in the United Kingdom. We are excited to bring our unmatched AID system to our first international market. Our plans to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany are on track for this fall with a broader staged rollout across our European markets in 2024.  We also meaningfully advanced our clinical and innovation initiatives during the second quarter. We had a formidable presence at ADA in June where we presented compelling new real-world data from the first year on Omnipod 5 in the U.S. for both type 1 and type 2 users. In addition, our U.S. type 2 pivotal and U.S., France randomized controlled trials are progressing well.  On the innovation side, we are thrilled to have submitted our 510(k) to the FDA for the Omnipod 5 iOS app for the iPhone. iOS phone control is one of the most requested features from our customers, and we look forward to bringing this new offering to market in the near term. We entered the second half of the year with clear momentum in our business and a focused strategy to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  Central to everything we do is our drive to deliver consumer-focused innovation. That is why we are incredibly excited about Omnipod 5 and the game-changing technology and experience it delivers. Its benefits are clear: simple and easy-to-use technology, an unmatched form factor and customer experience, affordability and broad access through the pharmacy channel, and notably, strong real-world clinical outcomes.  Omnipod 5 continues to have very broad appeal and is attracting substantial new customer starts across all age groups. In Q2, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 75-25 percentage split compared to our historical 80-20 mix.  We continue to capture significant tubed pump switches while also growing pump adoption from those coming from MDI, which is what our Omnipod brand of products was specifically designed for. Omnipod 5 adoption isn't the only evidence of considerable impact on the diabetes community. We are also seeing stable retention rates. We also saw a sizable increase in the number of HCPs who wrote scripts for Omnipod 5 in Q2, which was over 15,000, up from over 11,000 in Q1. That is in a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists.  The power of Omnipod 5 is also illustrated by the ongoing feedback we receive across the diabetes community, from Podders to their parents and loved ones to HCPs and other caregivers. We recently heard from a Podder who said, \"Since switching to Omnipod 5, I have never looked back.\" And an endo at a very large clinic recently informed us that he has changed how he communicates with his type 1 patients. He now strongly recommends AID therapy for all, and in the clear majority of cases, they choose Omnipod 5.  Our success-building awareness of and access to Omnipod is core to our strategy and ability to continue to lead in the type 1 and type 2 markets, both of which remain vastly underpenetrated. The market opportunity is massive. Excitingly, we see Omnipod 5 already contributing to overall pump adoption in the U.S., reinforcing our confidence that Omnipod will drive pump penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone from the approximate 40% where it is today.  The U.S. pharmacy channel also remains a key driver of our success, expanding access to Omnipod in the United States. The pharmacy channel simplifies the overall experience for patients and provides more affordable, convenient and efficient access. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it on par with the customer cost for MDI. And we continue to hear from our customers how convenient it is to get their pod through this channel.  We are capturing the market opportunity and improving the lives of our customers through not only our advanced technology and clinical outcomes but also our product's convenience and simplicity. This quarter, we significantly advanced our clinical initiatives. We had fantastic representation at ADA, including standing room-only at our product theater and a record number of leads at our booth.  We presented Omnipod 5 real-world evidence, demonstrating improved outcomes for children, adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes and, for the first time, Omnipod 5 real-world data for adults with type 2. The combined real-world data included 60,000 individuals across all age groups. Every day, we are building real-world evidence that undoubtedly demonstrates that our advanced algorithm and overall system is working exactly as it was designed and improving customer lives.  Our real-world data will be incredibly powerful over time since every Omnipod 5 user is cloud connected. We can continue to personalize and improve the overall customer experience while also streamlining physician workflows. We will have unprecedented insight into actual population-level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and to build on our already market-leading product differentiation.  Every day, we are building usage data from our rapidly growing Omnipod 5 customer base, and we will be able to use this private, secure de-identified data to constantly improve the customer care experience, from diagnosis all the way through the course of their lives. We'll be able to learn from usage patterns, increasingly segment our offerings and drive coaching engines.  To put it simply, the better we make the customer experience and streamline workflows, the more we'll have product preference, the more data we'll have, and it will effectively be a data flywheel that builds on itself. This is where we will continue to lead. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy.  As we also mentioned at ADA, we expect to begin enrollment in a matter of weeks for a trial using Omnipod 5 with the FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM, which will include up to 200 participants with type 1 diabetes across 18 institutions in the U.K., France and Belgium. It will be a 13-week randomized controlled trial, including those currently on MDI, with the primary endpoint of change in A1c.  Although not needed from a regulatory perspective, we expect the data from this trial to support our pricing and access initiatives. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre is far along and has advanced to the point where we will soon place study participants on the integrated system.  We also announced our first feasibility study of a next-generation AID algorithm, which will take place in New Zealand and for which recruitment began last month. This 11-week study will include up to 72 participants aged 16 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and is designed to assess safety and effectiveness. Our new algorithm work is informed by our incredibly strong usage data, which allows us to continue to advance our system in even more ways than we had originally envisioned.  We advanced other major clinical programs during Q2, including our type 2 pivotal study, for which we expect to complete enrollment by the end of the year. As a reminder, this is a 3-month study of up to 350 people, making it the largest type 2 study we have conducted. The feedback we have received from HCPs and study participants is encouraging. HCPs are impressed with how well participants are doing on Omnipod 5, and the participants have strongly expressed their desire to stay on product after the trial's completion. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a game changer for people with type 2 diabetes, and we are confident Omnipod 5 can have an even greater impact on this underserved population.  Lastly, our final participant in France is on track to soon complete our Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6 randomized controlled trial. Once complete, we will analyze and prepare the data to negotiate access and premium pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. We expect providing this data will be one of many initiatives that will support our Omnipod 5 international commercial launches, which are now underway.  While Omnipod 5 is disrupting diabetes management today and is expected to do so for a long time to come, we know a robust innovation pipeline is necessary to drive sustainable long-term growth. We will soon begin our Omnipod GO U.S. limited commercial rollout, which will also include HCPs whom we don't typically call upon and that are \"new to Omnipod.\" This will allow us to test the market and expand our reach.  This new-to-market, simplified product will grant us access earlier in the type 2 pathway and addresses critical barriers that can prevent the initiation of insulin therapy, namely fear of needles as well as challenges with dosing accuracy and consistency. Omnipod GO will expand our addressable market by at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone who require basal-only insulin. We look forward to the key learnings from our pilot program, which will help inform our full market release in 2024.  We are very well positioned in the type 2 market to grow adoption with Omnipod DASH and, soon, Omnipod GO, not to mention an expected future type 2 indication for Omnipod 5. We certainly have a number of competitive advantages in this space, including our differentiated form factor, an affordable pay-as-you-go business model and a pharmacy channel access. As a result, we continue to add a substantial number of type 2 patients to our customer base.  During Q2, people with type 2 diabetes represented an estimated 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. Given the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, our type 1 customer base is growing at an incredible rate, far outpacing type 2. However, on an absolute basis, our type 2 new customer starts increased sequentially.  We achieved another major innovation milestone in June with our 510(k) submission for the Omnipod 5 iOS app. The FDA's review is progressing, and we look forward to continuing to work with the agency so we can provide the iOS platform option to our expanding Omnipod 5 customer base.  We are also advancing our integration efforts with both of our CGM partners, allowing us to provide future CGM of choice with Omnipod 5, which we firmly believe is the best AID system on the market. We expect these integrations will be one of many catalysts that fuel our long-term growth and strengthen our value proposition and, most importantly, allow us to continue to execute our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  We continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. We also actively defend our valuable portfolio of proprietary technologies and innovations as appropriate.  As you may know, earlier this year, we successfully took legal action against the distribution of EOFlow's product in Germany. In that case, the court determined that EOFlow infringes Insulet's unique technologies, and the court quickly issued an injunction prohibiting EOFlow's distributor from further infringing on our patents in Germany. Subsequently, after further investigation, we filed an additional suit last week in the U.S. against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the continued misappropriation of our valuable and proprietary trade secrets as well as the infringement of our patents and other IP.  We not only will enforce our patents when necessary, we also will zealously protect our valuable trade secrets. We are confident we have a clear lead both technically and in terms of scalability, and we will not hesitate to vigorously defend our IP when we see followers misappropriating or infringing on it in an attempt to catch up.  Moving on to our international operations. We are excited to have commercially launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. in June. While it has only been a brief period of time, the market response has been fantastic. Following launch, we saw an almost doubling of our typical customer order rates, 1and we quickly started a considerable number of Omnipod 5 users throughout last month alone, including both new customers as well as those already on brand.  We are thrilled to provide our advanced technology to those who have long been waiting for it. We remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany this fall, closer to the beginning of the season with a broader staged international rollout in 2024. By the end of 2024, our goal is to have Omnipod 5 available for the majority of our European customers.  In closing, we've reached the midpoint of 2023 and have incredible momentum in our business. We are delivering strong financial performance and achieving key strategic milestones. We have advanced our commercial, innovation and clinical programs and Omnipod 5, and our entire business shows no signs of slowing down. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry in advanced innovation.  It's gratifying that others in the industry see our leadership and are attempting to follow our established best-in-class fully disposable patch form factor. We are investing for sustained leadership and widespread international expansion. We are transforming diabetes management, and we are only beginning to drive our life-changing innovations to market.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Jim. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance and strategic progress and once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts. We generated 32% revenue growth in Q2, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of 33%.  On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 20 basis point tailwind compared to Q2 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 41%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with consecutive record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where we provide the Personal Diabetes Manager at no charge.  Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net headwind of approximately $4 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $16 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers, in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.  This estimate is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $13 million and another $7 million reduction associated with an increase in actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. The benefit of the pharmacy channel continues to be a competitive advantage, and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q2 represented over 90% of our total U.S. volume.  International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, in line with our expectations. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH in our international markets as well as a combination of items associated with order and revenue recognition timing that contributed approximately 300 basis points of growth. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind over the prior year.  Our estimated global attrition and utilization remain consistent. Our delivery revenue increased 18%, above the high end of our guidance range due to favorable production fees and timing. Gross margin was 66.8%, up approximately 320 basis points.  Cost of revenue included income of $800,000 due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 66.6%, slightly above our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue, including favorable mix.  The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel, improved manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in warranty expense. These were partially offset by higher costs associated with Omnipod 5 production, higher expected production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production, as well as inflation.  Operating expenses were up year-over-year to support higher-than-expected revenue and investments in our business to further drive our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 7.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $800,000, and both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin.  Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $660 million in cash. In June, we extended our credit facility 4 years and increased our borrowing capacity under the facility to $300 million, all of which is currently available. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our expanding pipeline and other key areas of our organization and build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth.  Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 25% to 28% and total company revenue growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to 33% to 36%, driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both record new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel.  As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 U.S. full market release, which started in August of last year. This includes the related 2 script and retail channel stocking volume benefits, which were in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect 7% to 10% constant currency growth. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 300 basis points.  We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We are excited to have kicked off our Omnipod 5 international rollout. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect the Omnipod 5 launches to start inflecting in our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect a decline of 50% to 45%, representing a dollar decline similar to what we experienced in 2022.  Turning to 2023 gross margin. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts to gross margin include increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, geographical sales mix and improved manufacturing. These drivers are expected to be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation.  As we've previously stated, we expect many of these factors to continue to impact our results into 2024. However, we expect gradual improvement over the course of the coming years. We still expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range.  Given our market leadership position and large unpenetrated market opportunities, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise with investments in our commercial, innovation and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We are reaffirming our guide of adjusted operating margin of high single digits and expect it to be closer to the high end of the range.  We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross profit. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022.  Turning to our third quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 20% to 23% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. Our growth drivers remain the same: the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel, and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. With strong new customer start momentum, we continue to accelerate sequentially and, as a result, are guiding to strong sequential dollar growth in Q3.  For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 2% to 5%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and a modest contribution from our Omnipod 5 launch, partially offset by increasing AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 800 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q3 Drug Delivery revenue decline of 30% to 25%.  In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance, achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer starts while also investing in key areas throughout our global business in order to drive sustainable growth and long-term value creation.  With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congrats on another nice quarter here. So Jim, I heard you say you're seeing no signs of slowing down, but as Wayde said, you're going to start lapping some tough comps in the second half of this year. The second half '23 implied worldwide Omnipod 5 -- Omnipod, I'm sorry, growth is about 21%. So how do you keep the momentum going at pod? Do you see yourself as a 20%-plus grower beyond 2023? And how are you thinking about these GLP-1s?\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats, too, and thanks for your question. We're not seeing any kind of pause. The new customer starts for Omnipod 5 and the demand for Omnipod 5 has -- continues to be terrific. We obviously had record starts in the quarter. We see a lot of momentum across all age groups, as we said.  And so we're very bullish on the growth. I know you're asking me a question to guide beyond '23 because you want to ask Wayde that question, but I'm actually going to throw this to Wayde so he can work through the numbers there for the second half.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. Thanks, Jim. And Larry, you're exactly right. We are almost completing 12 months of Omnipod 5, so it's been incredibly exciting to see the ramp here over the first few quarters. And we've got a couple of onetime things to account for.  If you recall, in the second half of 2022, the first 2 quarters of Omnipod 5, we're benefiting from a significant contribution from first customers and converting customers, getting 2 scripts in the quarter. And we called those out. They're similar to the benefit we got this quarter, $16 million. What's different is that we're now seeing some reduction in days on hand inventory as well as some increased return reserves in the pharmacy.  So a lot of dynamics playing out in the first year as we ramp up Omnipod 5. But as you call out, we've got a really strong guide, 30% for Q3 and implied for Q4 in the U.S. at the high end of the range. And so we're really excited about continuing to grow Omnipod 5 here at these [indiscernible] rates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: And I'll add my congratulations as well on a really nice quarter. I hate to waste the question on this, but given the moves in the stocks today, particularly in diabetes stocks, I thought it would be good, Jim, maybe if you want to just address your view on, I guess, it would be more relevant to type 2 diabetes, particularly increased GLP-1 use.  There was some good cardiovascular data today in obesity. Just your views on how GLP-1s may or may not impact the progression to type 2 diabetes and basal and intensive insulin. And just any impact and help investors frame it to your overall business.\nJames Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Robbie. I know it's a question of high interest. So as we've said before, we think it's terrific to see the pharmaceutical companies continue to innovate with therapies for people with type 2 diabetes. We get up every day to help people with diabetes, people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. So we think it's terrific that innovation is happening across all fronts.  And the GLP-1 class of drug has actually been out for a while, but this latest generation of GLP-1s is clearly having a really big impact and has additional efficacy from the existing class. And obviously, they're off to a start. So we think all that innovation is really good. Having said that, we're confident it doesn't impact our TAM.  And just to give you a couple of reasons why, the first 1 is the global problem with type 2 diabetes is enormous. There are more than 0.5 billion people living with diabetes around the world, and that number continues to grow. Most of them have type 2 diabetes. So it's a massive unmet medical need globally and in the U.S. and massively underserved as a population. So that's the first thing.  The second thing is, when you look at our offerings, even in the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million people living with type 2 diabetes who also need intensive insulin therapy today. So intensive therapy in basal plus bolus, so that's 2.5 million people in a U.S. TAM whose condition has progressed to where their relevant target market for us to help them with Omnipod DASH and soon with Omnipod 5.  And so we're just scratching the surface of that market. Pump penetration in that market is in the low single digits, maybe the mid-single digits. And the Omnipod platform has a right to win in that market because of its simplicity and its channel access and et cetera.  And the other third thing I'd point to is that we know that GLP-1 class of drugs has long coexisted with insulin. We saw that in our own type 2 feasibility trial, which we published 2 ATTDs ago. A lot of that population that used Omnipod 5 in that trial was already also using. That was an all-comer study in terms of the population.  And many, many of those patients who were using GLP-1s has still got great benefit from the Omnipod 5 in that trial. So we're very confident that we have a huge market of people who need our help with our Omnipod platform and when we get the label of Omnipod 5. And we don't see the GLP-1s changing our TAM.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair.\nMalgorzata Kaczor: I wanted to go a little bit deeper into the guidance on the U.S. I know I appreciate your comments to Larry. But the midpoint of the guide, obviously, is quite sizable relative to the beat this quarter, and you listed a variety of benefits.  But can you give us just a rough sense, on a percentage basis, how meaningful each of those impacts is to the guidance range? And then whether you're seeing kind of some more meaningful, I guess, sequential increases in new patient adds that maybe is atypical for a traditional Insulet year?\nWayde McMillan: Okay. Margaret, I can start that one off and just give you a little bit more insight to how we think about the guidance, the first part of your question related to the impact of the guide. Depending on high end or low end, the headwind from the tough comp in last year's Omnipod 5 ramp benefits in Q3 and Q4, between a 5% and 10% headwind to our guidance range. But really, the reason we have confidence in still being at 30% growth at the high end and continuing to grow at these accelerated rates is the result of our durable business model and the annuity factor.  And so we've had record new customer starts for several quarters, which gives us momentum into the second half here. And we're going to continue to build momentum. The high end of our range assumes we'll continue to see record level new customer starts. And given the momentum that we have today, we've got high confidence in doing that. So those are really the major factors.  As we called out in our prepared remarks, we see stable attrition and utilization, so we're assuming that continues at the high end as well. We don't see any major impact to attrition or utilization. A couple of other things to think about in the second half is we've had a good contribution to the premium moving into the pharmacy channel by converting a lot of our existing customers from the DME channel. We'll still continue to get that benefit. That benefit has grown each quarter as we've moved more and more volume into the pharmacy channel.  And again, as we said in our prepared remarks, 90% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel, so a significant increase from this time last year. So that premium is benefiting us here and will continue to benefit us in the second half, but it will be to a lesser extent because we're starting to reduce the number of converting customers each quarter.  And as you recall, we have planned to be through most of our existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel through the end of this year. We think most of those conversions will be done by the end of '23, and we think that will wane and, to a lesser extent, be a benefit here in the second half.  So those are the major changes when you look at the growth rate. But again, we are a volume business and, by far, the largest contributor to our growth rate is our volume growth, which is based on our customer base growing. And we continue to see that growing with new customer starts throughout the second half of this year again. So strong guide, strong momentum in the business, lots of tailwinds to help us continue here based on our annuity model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research.\nChristopher Pasquale: Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the International business and the O5 rollout there. Curious how much of your current international footprint U.K. and Germany represents. And I understand the comment about the installed base model and it taking some time to flow through, but if we just look at the U.S. example, the Omnipod 5 launch led to a pretty immediate growth inflection. So why couldn't we see something earlier than back half of next year outside the U.S.?\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Chris. I'll start with that one and then maybe Wayde will provide some color. So we're really excited about the Omnipod 5 launch in the U.K. It's going really well. I'll just share 1 story with you.  There's so much pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 across our European markets and all of our markets. And one of the clinics we work really closely with was -- had so many customers waiting to get on therapy. They actually put up decorations all over their office and put up a disco glitter ball as they brought people in to get set up on therapy. It was a huge celebration.  And as we said in our prepared remarks, our order rate has doubled. So it's off to a great start in the U.K. We're really excited about Germany. As to the percentages, we haven't broken those out. I don't think you'd find them materially different from a lot of medtech markets, but we haven't materially -- we haven't broken out those specific numbers for the markets.  In terms of the growth in the U.S. versus the growth in European markets, every market is a little bit different. One of the reasons, maybe the main reason we had such an effect on anticipated growth with Omnipod 5 in the U.S., it was all of the customer sources in the U.S. were at the high end or above the high end of our expectations, and that's because of the pharmacy channel. So in most of the European markets, customers who are on a therapy are locked into a contract. And in the U.S., if you're locked into a contract with your tubed pump, you can cross over into a pharmacy benefit. And so that's what -- that's in the U.S., what's allowed us to have so many competitive conversions in our new customer starts.  In the European markets, it's a little different everywhere, but it's less flexible for patients who are on a therapy. So they have to typically wait for their contract to come up. So therefore, most of our new customer starts are customers who are new to therapy and were getting some upgrades from our own products.  And then we'll be bringing in new customer starts who are converting, but they're converting in that whatever the annual cycle is, whether it's a 4-year cycle, in some markets, it's a 5-year cycle. So when they come available, they're really relevant targets for us to move off of competitive pumps. But that just changes. It changes the dynamic of the flow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: Wayde, maybe I think we're all trying to kind of feel you out, obviously, on U.S. growth rates for next year, and I know you're not guiding to next year. But a couple of the moving pieces that you talked about this quarter, that reduction in channel inventory of $13 million, the $7 million in returns. How much of that do you think is left to play out, to go away as a headwind maybe as we get deeper into this year and heading into next year? And then I know you keep calling out every quarter this patient behavior of doubling up and getting maybe 4 months of inventory in a 3-month period when you first start O5. But that behavior has stayed pretty consistent now for the better part of the year, so it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of change going on there. So to me, it almost feels like this net kind of neutralizing of those 2 factors should drop away on the headwind side and maybe you keep a little bit of that tailwind. So I guess my point on all that is you seem to be guiding to about 25% growth in the U.S. Omnipod business for the back half of this year. Obviously, a very strong number against that low to mid-40% comps. Is that crazy to think that could be a starting-off point on how we think of next year as you get the tough comps? You maybe get a little bit less of that premium upgrade from DME to pharmacy, but you also get a little drop-off of those headwinds that I was talking about?\nWayde McMillan: Jeff, happy to talk about guidance a little bit more here and certainly a lot of dynamics moving, and you've called out several of them. So why don't we just touch on them -- each of them again and make sure it's clear. So as we think about the days inventory on hand, and I'm glad you brought that one up, because it is something that we obviously don't have control over the distribution channel. And we are seeing the pharmacy channel be more efficient. And so maybe just to summarize what we've seen to date with Omnipod 5. In Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million inventory build and so it was a bit of a headwind for us this quarter. And then we saw really stable inventory days. We've estimated pretty stable inventory days up until last quarter when we saw a reduction in days inventory on hand.  And we thought that, that was pretty settled out at that point. But then we again saw days inventory on hand, a few days reduction again this quarter. So we're curious to see if this is where the pharmacy distribution channel settles out, or if they're down a couple of days and we'll see that come back. But we don't factor that into our guidance going forward because we can't predict it. So days inventory in hand from here, we don't know. However, we do see it trending a few days lower than we have seen over the past several quarters. And so there is potential that we could see some of that come back. You mentioned the 2 scripts. Again, this was another dynamic that we were curious to see how it would play out.  As you said, on the growth side of it or the total benefit side of it, we have seen a pretty consistent benefit. But remember, over half of that benefit has been the result of converting Omnipod customers from DASH and our Classic Omnipod on to Omnipod 5. And that is starting to ramp down here in the second half, and we're expecting to be through most of that in 2023. So interesting enough, the last 2 quarters, that benefit has been more than offset by the days inventory in hand reductions as well as some are increase to our returns reserve. And so we haven't really seen it as a total net benefit because those dynamics all basically wash each other out.  So to your point, if we don't see any more increases in return reserves, and we don't expect that we will, and we don't see any changes to days inventory in hand, we would assume we'll continue to see a 2 script benefit moving forward, but to a much lesser extent as we move into 2024. So all those things together, Jeff, we still think that the largest part of our growth, by far, is going to be the new customer start metric.  And at consistent attrition and utilization rates, it really is a volume business. And that's what we would highlight for you and others here is really focused on those new customer starts, the growing customer base and how we accelerate volume from here. And that's what gives us confidence to be even with these pretty strong tough comps in the second half, to be guiding at 30% at the high end of our range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nDoyle Shell: This is Glenn Shell on for Jayson. And I just had a quick question with regard to moving the Omnipod Classic users to Omnipod 5. Where are we in that conversion? And are you seeing higher attrition from the Omnipod Classic as it's discontinued?\nWayde McMillan: Yes, Glenn. Sure, happy to start this one, Glenn. So we are through most of the Omnipod Classic exchange to either DASH or Omnipod 5 in the U.S. And so we have announced in the U.S. that our plan is to move our customers and discontinue the product in the U.S. Having said that, we're going to wait and see where we're at by the end of the year to make a final determination there.  Obviously, we're going to take care of all of our Omnipodders, our customers that had been with us for some time. But they've got great options to move to DASH and Omnipod 5. Given the coverage levels that we have in the pharmacy channel now for both DASH and Omnipod 5, it is a lot easier for our former Omnipod Classic customers to move on to DASH.  And so we are not seeing a higher attrition rate. In fact, our early estimates show us that our converting customers are staying with the product and really either Classic to DASH or Classic to Omnipod 5. In both cases, we've seen that at accelerated rates and the attrition has been really strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: A quick clarification, Wayde. When I put up all the numbers that you gave in adjustments, I got to like 48% U.S. growth. Just wanted to clarify that number to make sure that was right, what I accounted for all the adjustments.  And then on the Q4 guide, it looks like if you look at the Q4 implied guide, you're somewhere around 20% U.S. growth. Is that the right way to think about the starting point for 2024 and next year as you think about lapping some of the tougher comps?\nWayde McMillan: Travis, I wasn't quite tracking with you on which quarter for the 48%. But you may be thinking about the net headwind of $4 million, which just adds a couple of percentage basis points on a normalized basis to this quarter. So it does benefit us. I think that's the direction you're heading is we do get a benefit because of that net headwind this quarter. And I guess if you're adding in the tough comp for the second half, that also benefits us. But maybe what I would focus on out of your question was just the implied guide for Q4. So of course, we don't guide to Q4 at this point. We just do Q3 and Q4.  But in that implied guide, you should be near 30% at the high end of the range. And that's our expectation is that, given the strong momentum in the business here, we have 30% at the high end of the range for Q3 and close to 30% in the range for the implied Q4 as well. Thanks, Travis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup.\nJoanne Wuensch: I'm a little bit curious about the timing of the iOS application, the integration with G7 and the integration with L2. And what do you think -- once those next steps come along, what you think the benefit may be to the franchise?\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Joanne. We're really excited about all 3 of those programs. And as you know, as we said in the prepared remarks and we said at ADA, the iOS app is filed with the FDA. And so we're waiting clearance there and then we'll be prepping for launch as soon as we can, as soon as we practically can. So really excited about that, very requested feature. It's interesting. On that one, specifically, there are a lot of customers out there in Omnipod 5 who have made the decision to not pull back. And so when I talk to physicians when I'm out in the field, there's a lot of patients who are carrying their controller and their phone. They just -- they want to not have to carry both. And so that's a big requested feature.  Having said that, there -- I'm sure there are some people who are waiting for iOS to come on to Omnipod 5. So it's hard for us to estimate what that is, but we do think that will give us a boost, and it'll certainly be a big customer satisfier for us and certainly help us to continue with such great retention rates and customer experience. So we're really bullish on that. With the 2 -- with G7 and with the FreeStyle, with our 2 partners, Abbott and Dexcom and FreeStyle family of sensors, obviously, we're working hard, working really well with both of them, great collaboration with both of them. We want to get on -- we want to get to a sensor of choice just as quickly as we can and the programs are proceeding really, really well.  As you know, we don't forecast timings or talk about that -- talk about timings for those things. But it's obvious we have to be fairly far along with FreeStyle Libre 2 to be embarking on that study we're doing in the U.K. We're very bullish on that. But the partnership with both of them goes really well, and we're working hard to get those to market as quickly as we can.  And we think that both of them provide a boost for us. Obviously, when you think about G7, it's off to a very quick launch and is a good -- a really good customer experience. And when you think about the FreeStyle Libre family of sensors, very, very well positioned, particularly in other geographies. And so we think they provide sustained growth for us, and they provide a great customer experience for us to be able to provide that kind of choice as quickly as we can to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: On the HCP prescriber increase, I thought the sequential increase was notable. Can you talk about what you're seeing that's driving that prescriber expansion? Is it use of Omnipod 5 in type 2 even before formal labeling there? And are you calling on these HCPs or is this sort of more organic?\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Steve. Yes, we're really heartened to see that. I think that there are a number of things driving it. The first one is Omnipod 5 is just so accessible as a product and as an experience. And we're seeing increasing confidence with the writing of prescriptions for Omnipod 5 across the whole range of HCPs.  So you'll see endocrinologists and physicians writing the scripts. You'll see nurse practitioners, physician extenders, physician assistants writing those scripts. So it's very broad. And it's because of the ease of use of Omnipod 5, it's an easy thing to write for. And that's what we're seeing in the expansion of our prescribing population. And I'll tell you, the interest is really robust all across the board.  And so just as an example, our team was just down in Houston over the weekend at the ADCES conference, which is the conference for diabetes educators. And we just had phenomenal interest in the product platforms and in Omnipod 5. All of our workshops and showcases were sort of standing room-only attendance beyond what was like better -- bigger than the room space kind of attendance.  And that just demonstrates the broad reach and the ease of use of the Omnipod 5 product, which is, of course, a huge advantage for us. Because the Pod platform, the product experience is so easy compared to our tubed pump competitors, and that's why we're seeing the expansion of prescribers in the market.\nWayde McMillan: And Jim, I can pick up on the type 2 part of Steve's question as well. As you saw in our reported results here, type 2 making up 20% of our new customer starts, and that's a tick-up from what we've seen in the last 3 quarters. We've been running in at 15% to 20%. And so with a record new customer start quarter, we are still seeing good new customer starts. That is partially driven by DASH. But as you said, HCPs are writing for type 2. We cannot market for type 2 yet. As you know, we do not have the label. And so we don't condone it by any means. And our team is working incredibly hard, as Jim touched on in his prepared remarks, to get our type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 completed and submit that to the FDA so that we can get on label and start to market type 2 for -- or Omnipod 5 for type 2 patients. And so it is certainly core to our strategy. And a lot of people with diabetes with type 2 that we would like to bring Omnipod 5 to, and we're certainly working as hard as we can to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: I wanted to just ask about segment of the new patient starts and just on competitive pump conversions. Do you have any data on those conversions being end-of-warranty conversions versus middle-of-warranty conversions and how that's trending? And then potentially, just how are you thinking about a direct-to-consumer campaign for Omnipod 5? Any historic successes with DTCs in the past as a reference would be helpful, too.\nWayde McMillan: Sure. Josh, I can start with that one on the new customer start question and pass it to Jim for an update on our DTC or direct-to-consumer strategy. So we continue to see strong competitive conversions. Although the mix has changed in our reported numbers somewhat, the total number of competitive conversions continues to be strong and certainly elevated above the levels that we saw before Omnipod 5.  And so we don't break out the specific numbers for you there about -- like we don't actually track from them whether they're in warranty or not in warranty. That's just not part of our data set. We just know customers that tell us if they're converting from a competitive pump or not. So we don't have that insight for you, Josh, even to give any color on in-warranty or out-of-warranty. We make estimates, but it would be too much of a stretch to try to quantify that.  And then, Jim, maybe a little bit on our DTC strategy?\nJames Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. DTC is a very effective tool for us, and we're really confident that we have a strong return on investment in our DTC program. One thing that I'll just flag is that DTC doesn't just mean TV for us, right? We have a very robust mix of the way we reach out to customers and consumers, and that includes social.  It includes what is called over-the-top or streaming media. It will include more broadcast TV. And it includes influencers. We have a really active campaign with influencers and so on. And we have a really good sense of which levers to pull and so on.  And I'm very confident in what our team is able to produce, and we're getting really good at dialing it up and down based upon the results. And so you'll continue to see us doing DTC campaigns. You might periodically see us ramp up on TV as we feel like we need to, but we have a very broad mix and a very effective approach to it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: I know we're getting a little late here. Just Wayde or Jim, just as you talk about the key growth drivers for the business being on the volume side, if I think back -- I think it was 3 or 4 quarters ago, 60-40 was the split between MDI and conversions and then 70-30, I think, last quarter, now 75-25. So what I'm asking for, and I know the denominator is getting a lot bigger, but are you seeing any kind of slowdown in your ability to convert competitive pumpers right now? And I don't know if it's because of Medtronic being in the market or something like that. And then it seems like the enthusiasm for O5 from the MDI patient population is as strong, if not stronger, than this time last year when you first launched it, is that fair? Just maybe talk about the trajectory of those 2 groups of patients.\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. We're not seeing any kind of pause in the enthusiasm for Omnipod 5, and we continue to garner a lot of competitive conversions from both of our tubed pump competitors. And so the patient demand is really strong. Physician demand is really strong. And it's across all age groups really interestingly.  And so no pause, great positioning. And I've already forgotten the second half of your question. Can you repeat the second half of your question for me?\nWayde McMillan: Yes. I think it was just -- go ahead, Matt.\nMatthew O'Brien: Sorry, the enthusiasm around O5 within MDIs, is it even stronger?\nJames Hollingshead: Within MDI? Yes. If anything, the enthusiasm is even stronger. We're seeing record new customer starts. We're seeing the percentage mix is changing more because of MDI on the top, right? And so I think we're just so well positioned, and we're not -- the momentum for the business is terrific, and Omnipod 5 is just very, very broadly adopted and accepted. I'll give you an example. I was just out in the field last week, and I was in a pediatric clinic sitting with a physician who's been writing for us and for one of our main competitors for a long time. And she said to me, \"Listen, Omnipod 5 is so good. But at this point, I'm not writing really for your competitive pump, unless somebody specifically asks for it. And not just that, but everybody I've converted from the competitor pump on Omnipod 5 just does better.\" And I started to probe around why and the details, so they just do better. They just have better outcomes, they have a better experience. And so I think that's a really good sign for us in terms of how the learning curve of the market. Here, a year in, I think the market has learned a lot about Omnipod 5, how easy to see is what kind of great real-world outcomes it's driving. And we just see a ton of momentum across age groups and across all sources of customers, including MDI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on continuing to deliver really strong results here. Wayde, this question, I think, is for you. And it's, again, I appreciate you're not giving guidance for 2024. But just qualitatively, looking at the different potential tailwinds that could offset some of the headwinds from a comp perspective and the benefit from the 2 scripts for every new patients added in 2023. And just want to make sure we are thinking about these offsets correctly. So thinking -- appreciating not giving timing, but L2, G7 integration, [indiscernible], you have the GO. Like maybe walk us through qualitatively how to think about the headwinds and tailwinds that will be coming international from a tailwind perspective in 2024.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. It's a great way to look at it, Danielle. And I think you're right. The tailwinds vastly outweigh the headwinds for next year. As we think about the business where we sit today after halfway through 2023, we've had really strong new customer starts for several quarters. So that gives us great momentum into the second half.  I think the answer to your question will lie in the second half. If we continue to see strong new customer starts, record new customer starts in the second half of this year, that will give us great momentum into next year. And then as you teed up there, we have a significant pipeline of new innovations teed up. We haven't given the timing on those, whether they'll be '23 or '24 or even beyond yet.  But as those new innovations start to layer in, and of course, with our annuity model, they don't have an immediate sizable increase but they do start to help us accrue more customers over time. And so we're going to continue to build momentum. On the other side of the coin, obviously, AID competition is really strong for us outside the U.S., on the international side. And so what we provided an update in our prepared remarks today is that as a result of lower new customer starts than we usually had internationally, we've got lower growth rates to contend with there for the next 4 quarters. So that you can see our guide for the second half for international, and that will continue into the first half of '24. But given Omnipod 5 launching internationally, and we're going to add more countries next year, we expect the second half to start to inflect internationally. And so now we've moved into the mid- to low single digits. We think the second half of next year should be approaching that high single digits, low double digits type of range.  And so again, we're not providing specific guidance. But that gives you a feel for what we think is really strong momentum for the U.S. and improving positioning as we'll be able to compete in the AID side of the market internationally better at the end of this year and into next year. And then as that builds into the annuity model, we'll see an inflecting growth rate in the second half of 2024 internationally. So with all that in, again, it's such a dynamic launch here. We know it's going to be strong. We just don't know how strong, and so we can't provide numbers at this point. We'll typically give some color at the end of the Q3 call on what we're seeing going into 2024, and then we'll provide our guidance like we do every year for 2024 at the end of the Q4 call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies.\nMichael Sarcone: This is Mike Sarcone on for Matt. I just had a question on Omnipod GO. Can you just talk about what's left to do commercially ahead of the full market release in 2024? And maybe comment on how you're thinking about the financial contribution next year.\nJames Hollingshead: Sure. I'll start on the pilot plan and then I'll let Wayde talk about financial contribution. So we're really bullish on getting that market out in the hands of our pilot physicians and clinics. And the great thing about GO is that it solves a lot of problems for people who are initiating insulin therapy, as we said before. It resolved the needle phobia. It resolves dosing and so on. But it's new to world and it's new for us and it's new for those clinics because some of those clinics are places where we don't necessarily have a very strong call point footprint. And so what we need to do is get it out in the clinics. We need to go out and educate the clinics on the use of GO, which is incredibly simple experience. And we need to kind of test the waters with a couple of things about the dosing SKUs and some other things. So we need to see it in the real world, in the hands of the clinics, in the hands of our reps and make sure we just have -- we have the approach to the selling pitch correct, make sure we understand how to support the clinics that we're going into and so on. And we're giving ourselves time because it's a new-to-world offer and it's a new -- and there's some things about it that are kind of new commercial model for us. And so that's why we're saying we're going to pilot it here in the near term. We're going to learn what we learn, give ourselves some time to adjust and then commercialize in 2024.  And Wayde, if you want to talk about what we're modeling for financial impact.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. So Matt, we would love to know where Omnipod GO is going to go in 2024. We have many financial scenarios internally. But as Jim just said, we're going to take our time. We want to do this right. It's a new-to-world product, and so it's really difficult to know how fast Omnipod GO will ramp. We've obviously got the limited market release. As Jim said this year, we're going to learn a lot there and that's going to help us start to dial in our models for 2024. But I think at this point, I would say really thinking about Omnipod GO as a light contributor to our 2024 growth rates. And let's just give it some time to see how fast it does ramp. And when it starts to become a material contributor, that's when we certainly will start to layer it into our guidance, and we'll talk about more of it from a financial contribution standpoint. But until then, just given the new-to-world concept, we're not going to be communicating financial numbers for it at this time.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question, it will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: Just one maybe on that on the Omnipod question. That's just -- maybe as you build inventories, is that something that we'd expect to go up in any of your sort of days inventory numbers. Understanding that it's a pilot launch, but I'm sure you want to be prepared for demand to pick up. And I'll just leave it at that last follow-up.\nWayde McMillan: You bet, Matt. It's Wayde. I can certainly take that one, and it is something that our teams are working through today. And in fact, we're going to learn a lot through this limited market release. One of the key things or key learnings that we're working on is what is the optimal staging or building of inventory in the channel to support the GO launches. But I think just qualitatively, you're right. Just like with Omnipod 5, we're going to have enough inventory in the channel to serve the customers. And so like we saw in Q2 last year, when we did the limited market release for Omnipod 5, we called out a days inventory-on-hand build for Omnipod 5. Assuming the same plays out for Omnipod GO, we'll let you guys know if there's a material amount of inventory that has to go into the channel to launch with Omnipod GO. But nonetheless, it's an exciting program. The teams internally are really excited to see how the limited market releases go. We're going to learn a lot. There's certainly a very large market, an underserved market that needs better technology. We are the natural owner. We've got many benefits with Omnipod and our auto-injection as well as our fluid mechanics.  And I think the teams have done a really nice job of simplifying the Omnipod for this group of customers. And so we'll see how the limited market releases go. We'll have probably a lot more to say after that as we start to get into more of a full market release in 2024.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead.\nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are incredibly proud of the milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made. And thanks to our disruptive offerings and dedicated team who worked further along than our original expectations and setting our sights higher than ever before. Insulet has come a long way, and we are energized by the enormous market opportunity we are pursuing and the opportunity to drive rapid growth and substantial value for Insulet shareholders while fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. Thank you all for joining, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, we enjoyed another quarter of sustained strong momentum, and we remain on track for another successful and transformative year. The entire global Insulet team is executing at a high level, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance while also achieving several key strategic and innovation milestones.  On today's call, I'll touch on 4 main topics: our strong financial performance, our consumer-focused innovation and clinical achievements, how we're continuing to drive penetration of a massive market opportunity with expanded access and awareness and the Omnipod 5 international launch.  Starting with our financial performance. Our second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 33%, including U.S. growth of 41%. We also achieved total company growth of 32%. Because of these terrific results, we've raised our outlook for the year.  Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology market as the only FDA-approved fully disposable, pod-based automated insulin delivery system. Our flagship offering continues to be the major driver of U.S. revenue growth and was responsible for another record quarter of U.S. and global new customer starts. And Omnipod 5 represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts.  Building on our success in the U.S., we are very pleased to have completed the commercial launch of Omnipod 5 in the United Kingdom. We are excited to bring our unmatched AID system to our first international market. Our plans to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany are on track for this fall with a broader staged rollout across our European markets in 2024.  We also meaningfully advanced our clinical and innovation initiatives during the second quarter. We had a formidable presence at ADA in June where we presented compelling new real-world data from the first year on Omnipod 5 in the U.S. for both type 1 and type 2 users. In addition, our U.S. type 2 pivotal and U.S., France randomized controlled trials are progressing well.  On the innovation side, we are thrilled to have submitted our 510(k) to the FDA for the Omnipod 5 iOS app for the iPhone. iOS phone control is one of the most requested features from our customers, and we look forward to bringing this new offering to market in the near term. We entered the second half of the year with clear momentum in our business and a focused strategy to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  Central to everything we do is our drive to deliver consumer-focused innovation. That is why we are incredibly excited about Omnipod 5 and the game-changing technology and experience it delivers. Its benefits are clear: simple and easy-to-use technology, an unmatched form factor and customer experience, affordability and broad access through the pharmacy channel, and notably, strong real-world clinical outcomes.  Omnipod 5 continues to have very broad appeal and is attracting substantial new customer starts across all age groups. In Q2, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 75-25 percentage split compared to our historical 80-20 mix.  We continue to capture significant tubed pump switches while also growing pump adoption from those coming from MDI, which is what our Omnipod brand of products was specifically designed for. Omnipod 5 adoption isn't the only evidence of considerable impact on the diabetes community. We are also seeing stable retention rates. We also saw a sizable increase in the number of HCPs who wrote scripts for Omnipod 5 in Q2, which was over 15,000, up from over 11,000 in Q1. That is in a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists.  The power of Omnipod 5 is also illustrated by the ongoing feedback we receive across the diabetes community, from Podders to their parents and loved ones to HCPs and other caregivers. We recently heard from a Podder who said, \"Since switching to Omnipod 5, I have never looked back.\" And an endo at a very large clinic recently informed us that he has changed how he communicates with his type 1 patients. He now strongly recommends AID therapy for all, and in the clear majority of cases, they choose Omnipod 5.  Our success-building awareness of and access to Omnipod is core to our strategy and ability to continue to lead in the type 1 and type 2 markets, both of which remain vastly underpenetrated. The market opportunity is massive. Excitingly, we see Omnipod 5 already contributing to overall pump adoption in the U.S., reinforcing our confidence that Omnipod will drive pump penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone from the approximate 40% where it is today.  The U.S. pharmacy channel also remains a key driver of our success, expanding access to Omnipod in the United States. The pharmacy channel simplifies the overall experience for patients and provides more affordable, convenient and efficient access. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it on par with the customer cost for MDI. And we continue to hear from our customers how convenient it is to get their pod through this channel.  We are capturing the market opportunity and improving the lives of our customers through not only our advanced technology and clinical outcomes but also our product's convenience and simplicity. This quarter, we significantly advanced our clinical initiatives. We had fantastic representation at ADA, including standing room-only at our product theater and a record number of leads at our booth.  We presented Omnipod 5 real-world evidence, demonstrating improved outcomes for children, adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes and, for the first time, Omnipod 5 real-world data for adults with type 2. The combined real-world data included 60,000 individuals across all age groups. Every day, we are building real-world evidence that undoubtedly demonstrates that our advanced algorithm and overall system is working exactly as it was designed and improving customer lives.  Our real-world data will be incredibly powerful over time since every Omnipod 5 user is cloud connected. We can continue to personalize and improve the overall customer experience while also streamlining physician workflows. We will have unprecedented insight into actual population-level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and to build on our already market-leading product differentiation.  Every day, we are building usage data from our rapidly growing Omnipod 5 customer base, and we will be able to use this private, secure de-identified data to constantly improve the customer care experience, from diagnosis all the way through the course of their lives. We'll be able to learn from usage patterns, increasingly segment our offerings and drive coaching engines.  To put it simply, the better we make the customer experience and streamline workflows, the more we'll have product preference, the more data we'll have, and it will effectively be a data flywheel that builds on itself. This is where we will continue to lead. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy.  As we also mentioned at ADA, we expect to begin enrollment in a matter of weeks for a trial using Omnipod 5 with the FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM, which will include up to 200 participants with type 1 diabetes across 18 institutions in the U.K., France and Belgium. It will be a 13-week randomized controlled trial, including those currently on MDI, with the primary endpoint of change in A1c.  Although not needed from a regulatory perspective, we expect the data from this trial to support our pricing and access initiatives. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre is far along and has advanced to the point where we will soon place study participants on the integrated system.  We also announced our first feasibility study of a next-generation AID algorithm, which will take place in New Zealand and for which recruitment began last month. This 11-week study will include up to 72 participants aged 16 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and is designed to assess safety and effectiveness. Our new algorithm work is informed by our incredibly strong usage data, which allows us to continue to advance our system in even more ways than we had originally envisioned.  We advanced other major clinical programs during Q2, including our type 2 pivotal study, for which we expect to complete enrollment by the end of the year. As a reminder, this is a 3-month study of up to 350 people, making it the largest type 2 study we have conducted. The feedback we have received from HCPs and study participants is encouraging. HCPs are impressed with how well participants are doing on Omnipod 5, and the participants have strongly expressed their desire to stay on product after the trial's completion. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a game changer for people with type 2 diabetes, and we are confident Omnipod 5 can have an even greater impact on this underserved population.  Lastly, our final participant in France is on track to soon complete our Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6 randomized controlled trial. Once complete, we will analyze and prepare the data to negotiate access and premium pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. We expect providing this data will be one of many initiatives that will support our Omnipod 5 international commercial launches, which are now underway.  While Omnipod 5 is disrupting diabetes management today and is expected to do so for a long time to come, we know a robust innovation pipeline is necessary to drive sustainable long-term growth. We will soon begin our Omnipod GO U.S. limited commercial rollout, which will also include HCPs whom we don't typically call upon and that are \"new to Omnipod.\" This will allow us to test the market and expand our reach.  This new-to-market, simplified product will grant us access earlier in the type 2 pathway and addresses critical barriers that can prevent the initiation of insulin therapy, namely fear of needles as well as challenges with dosing accuracy and consistency. Omnipod GO will expand our addressable market by at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone who require basal-only insulin. We look forward to the key learnings from our pilot program, which will help inform our full market release in 2024.  We are very well positioned in the type 2 market to grow adoption with Omnipod DASH and, soon, Omnipod GO, not to mention an expected future type 2 indication for Omnipod 5. We certainly have a number of competitive advantages in this space, including our differentiated form factor, an affordable pay-as-you-go business model and a pharmacy channel access. As a result, we continue to add a substantial number of type 2 patients to our customer base.  During Q2, people with type 2 diabetes represented an estimated 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. Given the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, our type 1 customer base is growing at an incredible rate, far outpacing type 2. However, on an absolute basis, our type 2 new customer starts increased sequentially.  We achieved another major innovation milestone in June with our 510(k) submission for the Omnipod 5 iOS app. The FDA's review is progressing, and we look forward to continuing to work with the agency so we can provide the iOS platform option to our expanding Omnipod 5 customer base.  We are also advancing our integration efforts with both of our CGM partners, allowing us to provide future CGM of choice with Omnipod 5, which we firmly believe is the best AID system on the market. We expect these integrations will be one of many catalysts that fuel our long-term growth and strengthen our value proposition and, most importantly, allow us to continue to execute our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  We continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. We also actively defend our valuable portfolio of proprietary technologies and innovations as appropriate.  As you may know, earlier this year, we successfully took legal action against the distribution of EOFlow's product in Germany. In that case, the court determined that EOFlow infringes Insulet's unique technologies, and the court quickly issued an injunction prohibiting EOFlow's distributor from further infringing on our patents in Germany. Subsequently, after further investigation, we filed an additional suit last week in the U.S. against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the continued misappropriation of our valuable and proprietary trade secrets as well as the infringement of our patents and other IP.  We not only will enforce our patents when necessary, we also will zealously protect our valuable trade secrets. We are confident we have a clear lead both technically and in terms of scalability, and we will not hesitate to vigorously defend our IP when we see followers misappropriating or infringing on it in an attempt to catch up.  Moving on to our international operations. We are excited to have commercially launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. in June. While it has only been a brief period of time, the market response has been fantastic. Following launch, we saw an almost doubling of our typical customer order rates, 1and we quickly started a considerable number of Omnipod 5 users throughout last month alone, including both new customers as well as those already on brand.  We are thrilled to provide our advanced technology to those who have long been waiting for it. We remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany this fall, closer to the beginning of the season with a broader staged international rollout in 2024. By the end of 2024, our goal is to have Omnipod 5 available for the majority of our European customers.  In closing, we've reached the midpoint of 2023 and have incredible momentum in our business. We are delivering strong financial performance and achieving key strategic milestones. We have advanced our commercial, innovation and clinical programs and Omnipod 5, and our entire business shows no signs of slowing down. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry in advanced innovation.  It's gratifying that others in the industry see our leadership and are attempting to follow our established best-in-class fully disposable patch form factor. We are investing for sustained leadership and widespread international expansion. We are transforming diabetes management, and we are only beginning to drive our life-changing innovations to market.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats, too, and thanks for your question. We're not seeing any kind of pause. The new customer starts for Omnipod 5 and the demand for Omnipod 5 has -- continues to be terrific. We obviously had record starts in the quarter. We see a lot of momentum across all age groups, as we said.  And so we're very bullish on the growth. I know you're asking me a question to guide beyond '23 because you want to ask Wayde that question, but I'm actually going to throw this to Wayde so he can work through the numbers there for the second half. Sure. Thanks, Robbie. I know it's a question of high interest. So as we've said before, we think it's terrific to see the pharmaceutical companies continue to innovate with therapies for people with type 2 diabetes. We get up every day to help people with diabetes, people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. So we think it's terrific that innovation is happening across all fronts.  And the GLP-1 class of drug has actually been out for a while, but this latest generation of GLP-1s is clearly having a really big impact and has additional efficacy from the existing class. And obviously, they're off to a start. So we think all that innovation is really good. Having said that, we're confident it doesn't impact our TAM.  And just to give you a couple of reasons why, the first 1 is the global problem with type 2 diabetes is enormous. There are more than 0.5 billion people living with diabetes around the world, and that number continues to grow. Most of them have type 2 diabetes. So it's a massive unmet medical need globally and in the U.S. and massively underserved as a population. So that's the first thing.  The second thing is, when you look at our offerings, even in the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million people living with type 2 diabetes who also need intensive insulin therapy today. So intensive therapy in basal plus bolus, so that's 2.5 million people in a U.S. TAM whose condition has progressed to where their relevant target market for us to help them with Omnipod DASH and soon with Omnipod 5.  And so we're just scratching the surface of that market. Pump penetration in that market is in the low single digits, maybe the mid-single digits. And the Omnipod platform has a right to win in that market because of its simplicity and its channel access and et cetera.  And the other third thing I'd point to is that we know that GLP-1 class of drugs has long coexisted with insulin. We saw that in our own type 2 feasibility trial, which we published 2 ATTDs ago. A lot of that population that used Omnipod 5 in that trial was already also using. That was an all-comer study in terms of the population.  And many, many of those patients who were using GLP-1s has still got great benefit from the Omnipod 5 in that trial. So we're very confident that we have a huge market of people who need our help with our Omnipod platform and when we get the label of Omnipod 5. And we don't see the GLP-1s changing our TAM. Thanks, Chris. I'll start with that one and then maybe Wayde will provide some color. So we're really excited about the Omnipod 5 launch in the U.K. It's going really well. I'll just share 1 story with you.  There's so much pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 across our European markets and all of our markets. And one of the clinics we work really closely with was -- had so many customers waiting to get on therapy. They actually put up decorations all over their office and put up a disco glitter ball as they brought people in to get set up on therapy. It was a huge celebration.  And as we said in our prepared remarks, our order rate has doubled. So it's off to a great start in the U.K. We're really excited about Germany. As to the percentages, we haven't broken those out. I don't think you'd find them materially different from a lot of medtech markets, but we haven't materially -- we haven't broken out those specific numbers for the markets.  In terms of the growth in the U.S. versus the growth in European markets, every market is a little bit different. One of the reasons, maybe the main reason we had such an effect on anticipated growth with Omnipod 5 in the U.S., it was all of the customer sources in the U.S. were at the high end or above the high end of our expectations, and that's because of the pharmacy channel. So in most of the European markets, customers who are on a therapy are locked into a contract. And in the U.S., if you're locked into a contract with your tubed pump, you can cross over into a pharmacy benefit. And so that's what -- that's in the U.S., what's allowed us to have so many competitive conversions in our new customer starts.  In the European markets, it's a little different everywhere, but it's less flexible for patients who are on a therapy. So they have to typically wait for their contract to come up. So therefore, most of our new customer starts are customers who are new to therapy and were getting some upgrades from our own products.  And then we'll be bringing in new customer starts who are converting, but they're converting in that whatever the annual cycle is, whether it's a 4-year cycle, in some markets, it's a 5-year cycle. So when they come available, they're really relevant targets for us to move off of competitive pumps. But that just changes. It changes the dynamic of the flow. Thanks, Joanne. We're really excited about all 3 of those programs. And as you know, as we said in the prepared remarks and we said at ADA, the iOS app is filed with the FDA. And so we're waiting clearance there and then we'll be prepping for launch as soon as we can, as soon as we practically can. So really excited about that, very requested feature. It's interesting. On that one, specifically, there are a lot of customers out there in Omnipod 5 who have made the decision to not pull back. And so when I talk to physicians when I'm out in the field, there's a lot of patients who are carrying their controller and their phone. They just -- they want to not have to carry both. And so that's a big requested feature.  Having said that, there -- I'm sure there are some people who are waiting for iOS to come on to Omnipod 5. So it's hard for us to estimate what that is, but we do think that will give us a boost, and it'll certainly be a big customer satisfier for us and certainly help us to continue with such great retention rates and customer experience. So we're really bullish on that. With the 2 -- with G7 and with the FreeStyle, with our 2 partners, Abbott and Dexcom and FreeStyle family of sensors, obviously, we're working hard, working really well with both of them, great collaboration with both of them. We want to get on -- we want to get to a sensor of choice just as quickly as we can and the programs are proceeding really, really well.  As you know, we don't forecast timings or talk about that -- talk about timings for those things. But it's obvious we have to be fairly far along with FreeStyle Libre 2 to be embarking on that study we're doing in the U.K. We're very bullish on that. But the partnership with both of them goes really well, and we're working hard to get those to market as quickly as we can.  And we think that both of them provide a boost for us. Obviously, when you think about G7, it's off to a very quick launch and is a good -- a really good customer experience. And when you think about the FreeStyle Libre family of sensors, very, very well positioned, particularly in other geographies. And so we think they provide sustained growth for us, and they provide a great customer experience for us to be able to provide that kind of choice as quickly as we can to our customers. Thanks, Steve. Yes, we're really heartened to see that. I think that there are a number of things driving it. The first one is Omnipod 5 is just so accessible as a product and as an experience. And we're seeing increasing confidence with the writing of prescriptions for Omnipod 5 across the whole range of HCPs.  So you'll see endocrinologists and physicians writing the scripts. You'll see nurse practitioners, physician extenders, physician assistants writing those scripts. So it's very broad. And it's because of the ease of use of Omnipod 5, it's an easy thing to write for. And that's what we're seeing in the expansion of our prescribing population. And I'll tell you, the interest is really robust all across the board.  And so just as an example, our team was just down in Houston over the weekend at the ADCES conference, which is the conference for diabetes educators. And we just had phenomenal interest in the product platforms and in Omnipod 5. All of our workshops and showcases were sort of standing room-only attendance beyond what was like better -- bigger than the room space kind of attendance.  And that just demonstrates the broad reach and the ease of use of the Omnipod 5 product, which is, of course, a huge advantage for us. Because the Pod platform, the product experience is so easy compared to our tubed pump competitors, and that's why we're seeing the expansion of prescribers in the market. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. DTC is a very effective tool for us, and we're really confident that we have a strong return on investment in our DTC program. One thing that I'll just flag is that DTC doesn't just mean TV for us, right? We have a very robust mix of the way we reach out to customers and consumers, and that includes social.  It includes what is called over-the-top or streaming media. It will include more broadcast TV. And it includes influencers. We have a really active campaign with influencers and so on. And we have a really good sense of which levers to pull and so on.  And I'm very confident in what our team is able to produce, and we're getting really good at dialing it up and down based upon the results. And so you'll continue to see us doing DTC campaigns. You might periodically see us ramp up on TV as we feel like we need to, but we have a very broad mix and a very effective approach to it. Thanks, Matt. We're not seeing any kind of pause in the enthusiasm for Omnipod 5, and we continue to garner a lot of competitive conversions from both of our tubed pump competitors. And so the patient demand is really strong. Physician demand is really strong. And it's across all age groups really interestingly.  And so no pause, great positioning. And I've already forgotten the second half of your question. Can you repeat the second half of your question for me? Within MDI? Yes. If anything, the enthusiasm is even stronger. We're seeing record new customer starts. We're seeing the percentage mix is changing more because of MDI on the top, right? And so I think we're just so well positioned, and we're not -- the momentum for the business is terrific, and Omnipod 5 is just very, very broadly adopted and accepted. I'll give you an example. I was just out in the field last week, and I was in a pediatric clinic sitting with a physician who's been writing for us and for one of our main competitors for a long time. And she said to me, \"Listen, Omnipod 5 is so good. But at this point, I'm not writing really for your competitive pump, unless somebody specifically asks for it. And not just that, but everybody I've converted from the competitor pump on Omnipod 5 just does better.\" And I started to probe around why and the details, so they just do better. They just have better outcomes, they have a better experience. And so I think that's a really good sign for us in terms of how the learning curve of the market. Here, a year in, I think the market has learned a lot about Omnipod 5, how easy to see is what kind of great real-world outcomes it's driving. And we just see a ton of momentum across age groups and across all sources of customers, including MDI. Sure. I'll start on the pilot plan and then I'll let Wayde talk about financial contribution. So we're really bullish on getting that market out in the hands of our pilot physicians and clinics. And the great thing about GO is that it solves a lot of problems for people who are initiating insulin therapy, as we said before. It resolved the needle phobia. It resolves dosing and so on. But it's new to world and it's new for us and it's new for those clinics because some of those clinics are places where we don't necessarily have a very strong call point footprint. And so what we need to do is get it out in the clinics. We need to go out and educate the clinics on the use of GO, which is incredibly simple experience. And we need to kind of test the waters with a couple of things about the dosing SKUs and some other things. So we need to see it in the real world, in the hands of the clinics, in the hands of our reps and make sure we just have -- we have the approach to the selling pitch correct, make sure we understand how to support the clinics that we're going into and so on. And we're giving ourselves time because it's a new-to-world offer and it's a new -- and there's some things about it that are kind of new commercial model for us. And so that's why we're saying we're going to pilot it here in the near term. We're going to learn what we learn, give ourselves some time to adjust and then commercialize in 2024.  And Wayde, if you want to talk about what we're modeling for financial impact. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are incredibly proud of the milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made. And thanks to our disruptive offerings and dedicated team who worked further along than our original expectations and setting our sights higher than ever before. Insulet has come a long way, and we are energized by the enormous market opportunity we are pursuing and the opportunity to drive rapid growth and substantial value for Insulet shareholders while fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. Thank you all for joining, and have a great evening."

            "name": "Wayde McMillan",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance and strategic progress and once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts. We generated 32% revenue growth in Q2, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of 33%.  On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 20 basis point tailwind compared to Q2 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 41%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with consecutive record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where we provide the Personal Diabetes Manager at no charge.  Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net headwind of approximately $4 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $16 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers, in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.  This estimate is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $13 million and another $7 million reduction associated with an increase in actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. The benefit of the pharmacy channel continues to be a competitive advantage, and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q2 represented over 90% of our total U.S. volume.  International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, in line with our expectations. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH in our international markets as well as a combination of items associated with order and revenue recognition timing that contributed approximately 300 basis points of growth. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind over the prior year.  Our estimated global attrition and utilization remain consistent. Our delivery revenue increased 18%, above the high end of our guidance range due to favorable production fees and timing. Gross margin was 66.8%, up approximately 320 basis points.  Cost of revenue included income of $800,000 due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 66.6%, slightly above our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue, including favorable mix.  The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel, improved manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in warranty expense. These were partially offset by higher costs associated with Omnipod 5 production, higher expected production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production, as well as inflation.  Operating expenses were up year-over-year to support higher-than-expected revenue and investments in our business to further drive our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 7.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $800,000, and both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin.  Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $660 million in cash. In June, we extended our credit facility 4 years and increased our borrowing capacity under the facility to $300 million, all of which is currently available. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our expanding pipeline and other key areas of our organization and build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth.  Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 25% to 28% and total company revenue growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to 33% to 36%, driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both record new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel.  As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 U.S. full market release, which started in August of last year. This includes the related 2 script and retail channel stocking volume benefits, which were in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect 7% to 10% constant currency growth. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 300 basis points.  We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We are excited to have kicked off our Omnipod 5 international rollout. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect the Omnipod 5 launches to start inflecting in our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect a decline of 50% to 45%, representing a dollar decline similar to what we experienced in 2022.  Turning to 2023 gross margin. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts to gross margin include increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, geographical sales mix and improved manufacturing. These drivers are expected to be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation.  As we've previously stated, we expect many of these factors to continue to impact our results into 2024. However, we expect gradual improvement over the course of the coming years. We still expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range.  Given our market leadership position and large unpenetrated market opportunities, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise with investments in our commercial, innovation and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We are reaffirming our guide of adjusted operating margin of high single digits and expect it to be closer to the high end of the range.  We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross profit. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022.  Turning to our third quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 20% to 23% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. Our growth drivers remain the same: the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel, and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. With strong new customer start momentum, we continue to accelerate sequentially and, as a result, are guiding to strong sequential dollar growth in Q3.  For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 2% to 5%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and a modest contribution from our Omnipod 5 launch, partially offset by increasing AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 800 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q3 Drug Delivery revenue decline of 30% to 25%.  In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance, achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer starts while also investing in key areas throughout our global business in order to drive sustainable growth and long-term value creation.  With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Sure. Thanks, Jim. And Larry, you're exactly right. We are almost completing 12 months of Omnipod 5, so it's been incredibly exciting to see the ramp here over the first few quarters. And we've got a couple of onetime things to account for.  If you recall, in the second half of 2022, the first 2 quarters of Omnipod 5, we're benefiting from a significant contribution from first customers and converting customers, getting 2 scripts in the quarter. And we called those out. They're similar to the benefit we got this quarter, $16 million. What's different is that we're now seeing some reduction in days on hand inventory as well as some increased return reserves in the pharmacy.  So a lot of dynamics playing out in the first year as we ramp up Omnipod 5. But as you call out, we've got a really strong guide, 30% for Q3 and implied for Q4 in the U.S. at the high end of the range. And so we're really excited about continuing to grow Omnipod 5 here at these [indiscernible] rates. Okay. Margaret, I can start that one off and just give you a little bit more insight to how we think about the guidance, the first part of your question related to the impact of the guide. Depending on high end or low end, the headwind from the tough comp in last year's Omnipod 5 ramp benefits in Q3 and Q4, between a 5% and 10% headwind to our guidance range. But really, the reason we have confidence in still being at 30% growth at the high end and continuing to grow at these accelerated rates is the result of our durable business model and the annuity factor.  And so we've had record new customer starts for several quarters, which gives us momentum into the second half here. And we're going to continue to build momentum. The high end of our range assumes we'll continue to see record level new customer starts. And given the momentum that we have today, we've got high confidence in doing that. So those are really the major factors.  As we called out in our prepared remarks, we see stable attrition and utilization, so we're assuming that continues at the high end as well. We don't see any major impact to attrition or utilization. A couple of other things to think about in the second half is we've had a good contribution to the premium moving into the pharmacy channel by converting a lot of our existing customers from the DME channel. We'll still continue to get that benefit. That benefit has grown each quarter as we've moved more and more volume into the pharmacy channel.  And again, as we said in our prepared remarks, 90% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel, so a significant increase from this time last year. So that premium is benefiting us here and will continue to benefit us in the second half, but it will be to a lesser extent because we're starting to reduce the number of converting customers each quarter.  And as you recall, we have planned to be through most of our existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel through the end of this year. We think most of those conversions will be done by the end of '23, and we think that will wane and, to a lesser extent, be a benefit here in the second half.  So those are the major changes when you look at the growth rate. But again, we are a volume business and, by far, the largest contributor to our growth rate is our volume growth, which is based on our customer base growing. And we continue to see that growing with new customer starts throughout the second half of this year again. So strong guide, strong momentum in the business, lots of tailwinds to help us continue here based on our annuity model. Jeff, happy to talk about guidance a little bit more here and certainly a lot of dynamics moving, and you've called out several of them. So why don't we just touch on them -- each of them again and make sure it's clear. So as we think about the days inventory on hand, and I'm glad you brought that one up, because it is something that we obviously don't have control over the distribution channel. And we are seeing the pharmacy channel be more efficient. And so maybe just to summarize what we've seen to date with Omnipod 5. In Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million inventory build and so it was a bit of a headwind for us this quarter. And then we saw really stable inventory days. We've estimated pretty stable inventory days up until last quarter when we saw a reduction in days inventory on hand.  And we thought that, that was pretty settled out at that point. But then we again saw days inventory on hand, a few days reduction again this quarter. So we're curious to see if this is where the pharmacy distribution channel settles out, or if they're down a couple of days and we'll see that come back. But we don't factor that into our guidance going forward because we can't predict it. So days inventory in hand from here, we don't know. However, we do see it trending a few days lower than we have seen over the past several quarters. And so there is potential that we could see some of that come back. You mentioned the 2 scripts. Again, this was another dynamic that we were curious to see how it would play out.  As you said, on the growth side of it or the total benefit side of it, we have seen a pretty consistent benefit. But remember, over half of that benefit has been the result of converting Omnipod customers from DASH and our Classic Omnipod on to Omnipod 5. And that is starting to ramp down here in the second half, and we're expecting to be through most of that in 2023. So interesting enough, the last 2 quarters, that benefit has been more than offset by the days inventory in hand reductions as well as some are increase to our returns reserve. And so we haven't really seen it as a total net benefit because those dynamics all basically wash each other out.  So to your point, if we don't see any more increases in return reserves, and we don't expect that we will, and we don't see any changes to days inventory in hand, we would assume we'll continue to see a 2 script benefit moving forward, but to a much lesser extent as we move into 2024. So all those things together, Jeff, we still think that the largest part of our growth, by far, is going to be the new customer start metric.  And at consistent attrition and utilization rates, it really is a volume business. And that's what we would highlight for you and others here is really focused on those new customer starts, the growing customer base and how we accelerate volume from here. And that's what gives us confidence to be even with these pretty strong tough comps in the second half, to be guiding at 30% at the high end of our range. Yes, Glenn. Sure, happy to start this one, Glenn. So we are through most of the Omnipod Classic exchange to either DASH or Omnipod 5 in the U.S. And so we have announced in the U.S. that our plan is to move our customers and discontinue the product in the U.S. Having said that, we're going to wait and see where we're at by the end of the year to make a final determination there.  Obviously, we're going to take care of all of our Omnipodders, our customers that had been with us for some time. But they've got great options to move to DASH and Omnipod 5. Given the coverage levels that we have in the pharmacy channel now for both DASH and Omnipod 5, it is a lot easier for our former Omnipod Classic customers to move on to DASH.  And so we are not seeing a higher attrition rate. In fact, our early estimates show us that our converting customers are staying with the product and really either Classic to DASH or Classic to Omnipod 5. In both cases, we've seen that at accelerated rates and the attrition has been really strong. Travis, I wasn't quite tracking with you on which quarter for the 48%. But you may be thinking about the net headwind of $4 million, which just adds a couple of percentage basis points on a normalized basis to this quarter. So it does benefit us. I think that's the direction you're heading is we do get a benefit because of that net headwind this quarter. And I guess if you're adding in the tough comp for the second half, that also benefits us. But maybe what I would focus on out of your question was just the implied guide for Q4. So of course, we don't guide to Q4 at this point. We just do Q3 and Q4.  But in that implied guide, you should be near 30% at the high end of the range. And that's our expectation is that, given the strong momentum in the business here, we have 30% at the high end of the range for Q3 and close to 30% in the range for the implied Q4 as well. Thanks, Travis. And Jim, I can pick up on the type 2 part of Steve's question as well. As you saw in our reported results here, type 2 making up 20% of our new customer starts, and that's a tick-up from what we've seen in the last 3 quarters. We've been running in at 15% to 20%. And so with a record new customer start quarter, we are still seeing good new customer starts. That is partially driven by DASH. But as you said, HCPs are writing for type 2. We cannot market for type 2 yet. As you know, we do not have the label. And so we don't condone it by any means. And our team is working incredibly hard, as Jim touched on in his prepared remarks, to get our type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 completed and submit that to the FDA so that we can get on label and start to market type 2 for -- or Omnipod 5 for type 2 patients. And so it is certainly core to our strategy. And a lot of people with diabetes with type 2 that we would like to bring Omnipod 5 to, and we're certainly working as hard as we can to do that. Sure. Josh, I can start with that one on the new customer start question and pass it to Jim for an update on our DTC or direct-to-consumer strategy. So we continue to see strong competitive conversions. Although the mix has changed in our reported numbers somewhat, the total number of competitive conversions continues to be strong and certainly elevated above the levels that we saw before Omnipod 5.  And so we don't break out the specific numbers for you there about -- like we don't actually track from them whether they're in warranty or not in warranty. That's just not part of our data set. We just know customers that tell us if they're converting from a competitive pump or not. So we don't have that insight for you, Josh, even to give any color on in-warranty or out-of-warranty. We make estimates, but it would be too much of a stretch to try to quantify that.  And then, Jim, maybe a little bit on our DTC strategy? Yes. I think it was just -- go ahead, Matt. Yes. It's a great way to look at it, Danielle. And I think you're right. The tailwinds vastly outweigh the headwinds for next year. As we think about the business where we sit today after halfway through 2023, we've had really strong new customer starts for several quarters. So that gives us great momentum into the second half.  I think the answer to your question will lie in the second half. If we continue to see strong new customer starts, record new customer starts in the second half of this year, that will give us great momentum into next year. And then as you teed up there, we have a significant pipeline of new innovations teed up. We haven't given the timing on those, whether they'll be '23 or '24 or even beyond yet.  But as those new innovations start to layer in, and of course, with our annuity model, they don't have an immediate sizable increase but they do start to help us accrue more customers over time. And so we're going to continue to build momentum. On the other side of the coin, obviously, AID competition is really strong for us outside the U.S., on the international side. And so what we provided an update in our prepared remarks today is that as a result of lower new customer starts than we usually had internationally, we've got lower growth rates to contend with there for the next 4 quarters. So that you can see our guide for the second half for international, and that will continue into the first half of '24. But given Omnipod 5 launching internationally, and we're going to add more countries next year, we expect the second half to start to inflect internationally. And so now we've moved into the mid- to low single digits. We think the second half of next year should be approaching that high single digits, low double digits type of range.  And so again, we're not providing specific guidance. But that gives you a feel for what we think is really strong momentum for the U.S. and improving positioning as we'll be able to compete in the AID side of the market internationally better at the end of this year and into next year. And then as that builds into the annuity model, we'll see an inflecting growth rate in the second half of 2024 internationally. So with all that in, again, it's such a dynamic launch here. We know it's going to be strong. We just don't know how strong, and so we can't provide numbers at this point. We'll typically give some color at the end of the Q3 call on what we're seeing going into 2024, and then we'll provide our guidance like we do every year for 2024 at the end of the Q4 call. Yes. So Matt, we would love to know where Omnipod GO is going to go in 2024. We have many financial scenarios internally. But as Jim just said, we're going to take our time. We want to do this right. It's a new-to-world product, and so it's really difficult to know how fast Omnipod GO will ramp. We've obviously got the limited market release. As Jim said this year, we're going to learn a lot there and that's going to help us start to dial in our models for 2024. But I think at this point, I would say really thinking about Omnipod GO as a light contributor to our 2024 growth rates. And let's just give it some time to see how fast it does ramp. And when it starts to become a material contributor, that's when we certainly will start to layer it into our guidance, and we'll talk about more of it from a financial contribution standpoint. But until then, just given the new-to-world concept, we're not going to be communicating financial numbers for it at this time. You bet, Matt. It's Wayde. I can certainly take that one, and it is something that our teams are working through today. And in fact, we're going to learn a lot through this limited market release. One of the key things or key learnings that we're working on is what is the optimal staging or building of inventory in the channel to support the GO launches. But I think just qualitatively, you're right. Just like with Omnipod 5, we're going to have enough inventory in the channel to serve the customers. And so like we saw in Q2 last year, when we did the limited market release for Omnipod 5, we called out a days inventory-on-hand build for Omnipod 5. Assuming the same plays out for Omnipod GO, we'll let you guys know if there's a material amount of inventory that has to go into the channel to launch with Omnipod GO. But nonetheless, it's an exciting program. The teams internally are really excited to see how the limited market releases go. We're going to learn a lot. There's certainly a very large market, an underserved market that needs better technology. We are the natural owner. We've got many benefits with Omnipod and our auto-injection as well as our fluid mechanics.  And I think the teams have done a really nice job of simplifying the Omnipod for this group of customers. And so we'll see how the limited market releases go. We'll have probably a lot more to say after that as we start to get into more of a full market release in 2024."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 first quarter results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our first quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're off to a great start to 2023. We entered the year with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business, and the Insulet team continues to execute and deliver on our ambitious expectations. We expect 2023 to be another year of strong growth and strategic progress. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, and today, we increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. We achieved another record first quarter for U.S. revenue growth of 49% and 35% for total Omnipod and once again delivered another record for U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. Omnipod 5 continues to be a driving force of our strong U.S. growth and in Q1, it represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts. This revolutionary offering is transforming diabetes management. Last week, we also received FDA clearance for our basal-only Pod named Omnipod GO. This is a unique product for the type 2 market. It provides us with early entry into treatment pathway, gives physicians and people with diabetes a comfortable non-injection option to deliver and receive insulin and provides patients an improved experience. By eliminating the personal diabetes manager and offering preset levels of basal insulin, we are easing patients into insulin management while leveraging Omnipod's comfortable tubeless technology. We're excited about bringing this innovation to market in 2024. Now to Omnipod 5, which continues to disrupt the diabetes market with its elegance and ease of use as well as consistently impressive real-world outcomes. It has strengthened our position as the market leader by revenue and is rapidly helping us take leadership among new pump prescriptions, thanks to our high share of multiple daily injection new starts and the large number of customer switches from competitive tube offerings. In Q1, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from MDI and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 70/30 split compared to our historical 80/20 mix as a result of the strong number of competitive switches we continue to capture. Omnipod 5's ease-of-use, simplified access, quality of life and strong clinical outcomes, coupled with our team's execution, has positioned us to continue to win across all market segments. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched compared to other AID systems, and the feedback we hear from customers speaks to its unique benefits. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who operates a clinic with almost 3,000 patients across both type 1 and type 2, many of whom use one of our Omnipod solutions. He has hundreds of patients now on Omnipod 5, and he is using it himself. He called Omnipod 5 a \"game changer\" and said, \"Thank you for everything you do. I've waited 40 years for this product, and it's more than what I had hoped for.\" This sentiment is echoed by so many HCPs who tell us that their Omnipod 5 patients span all age groups, including people over the age of 80 who have been on MDI for decades and would never have considered pumps before learning about and experiencing Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Much of this success is a testament to how we designed our system. As we do with all of our innovations, we designed Omnipod 5 with the customer 100% in mind, with a clear focus on how we could simplify each day, improve quality of life and drive better outcomes. We offer an algorithm that provides micro doses every five minutes to adjust the target versus other systems that need to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. Plus with Omnipod 5, there is no need to disconnect. Our algorithm learns, adapts and personalizes for each user. Our users are able to achieve excellent time and range with the lowest incidence of hypoglycemia on the market. The real-world evidence we shared at ATTD with data from more than 31,000 Omnipod 5 users is unmatched by competitors. And we look forward to sharing a larger data set at the ADA Trade Show next month, building on the clinical outcomes and quality of life that only Omnipod 5 can provide. These clinical outcomes, combined with Omnipod 5's form factor and ease of use, are proving to be life-changing for our users. Our market leadership also depends on building awareness of and access to Omnipod, and our team continues to execute with excellence against these objectives. Our efforts to drive access and awareness are critically important, given how underpenetrated the global type 1 and type 2 pump markets are, driving growing need for advanced solutions. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are approximately 11 million people with insulin-intensive diabetes who can benefit from Omnipod. Approximately 45% have type 1 and 55% type 2, and these markets remain vastly underserved. Pump penetration in the U.S. type 1 market is still only approximately 40% and only low single digits in type 2, and international market penetration is much below the U.S. There is a massive unmet need for insulin therapy solutions, which also means we have a massive market opportunity. The Omnipod platform, and especially Omnipod 5, will open that market even further. Prior to Omnipod 5, consensus was there was a natural cap on pump adoption of around 70%, but these estimates have all been built based upon the adoption curve of tubed pumps. You've heard us call Omnipod 5 a game changer, and we believe it changes this game. Omnipod 5's simplicity, ease of use, cost and access and, importantly, outstanding clinical outcomes driven by our advanced algorithm will allow us to bring customers into the market who would have otherwise never considered or never been considered for an insulin pump. We are seeing this in our market feedback already. Additionally, CGM is helping to pave the way by raising awareness for Omnipod and, in turn, we are bringing more people to CGM. Our sources indicate CGM U.S. type 1 market penetration is nearing 80%, making us even more confident in Omnipod 5's potential to grow penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone. The Omnipod platform is quickly becoming the new standard of care for insulin delivery. A critical element to our access strategy is growing our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. This makes access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH much more affordable, convenient and efficient, with low co-pays and the ability to pick up product at the local pharmacy or through mail order with no lock-in periods. And the vast majority of Omnipod 5 prescriptions are filled in a matter of days compared to weeks through the DME channel. In the U.S. market, we price Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH to drive access for Omnipod 5 quickly so we can make it affordable for the large number of people we knew would want it. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it relatively on par with customer costs for multiple daily injections. Combined with no upfront cost to start on Omnipod 5, we invite any patient to experience the difference of Omnipod. Omnipod 5, just like Omnipod DASH is widely covered in the U.S. Our team\u2019s customer-centric focus and commitment to operational excellence enabled us to drive incredibly strong coverage for Omnipod 5 in a short period of time, positioning us for the enormous level of affordable broad-based adoption we have seen. And as such, we will no longer provide quarterly coverage updates similar to the approach we took with Omnipod DASH. In practical terms, both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH are now fully covered. Our clinical initiatives continue to progress, including our type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this three month study will be the largest we have ever conducted, including up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes across 20 sites in the U.S. with a targeted focus on recruiting diverse and underserved populations. We began enrollment shortly after our last earnings call and we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019re excited to show what Omnipod 5 can do for people with type 2 diabetes. We are also making great progress with our Omnipod 5 three month randomized controlled trial. The last study participant in the U.S. is nearing completion and in France enrollment is nearing completion and we expect the last participant to complete the study by the fall. We believe this RCT study will be beneficial when negotiating access and premium pricing. Both our type 2 pivotal study and our RCT will be valuable additions to the already strong clinical body of evidence that we have been building for Omnipod 5 over the last several years. Fueled by the success of Omnipod 5, our teams are already working on what\u2019s coming next. As I mentioned, we received clearance for Omnipod GO in the U.S., which should further build on our type 2 leadership position. We estimate the total addressable market for Omnipod GO is at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We expect to begin a small pilot program this year in select locations and remain on track for a commercial launch in 2024. We have several competitive advantages in the type 2 space, including those that exist for us in the type 1 market, such as our unique form factor and our U.S. pharmacy channel access. In Q1, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. This percentage is lower than historical levels due to the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, which like all AID systems has an indication for only the type 1 market. On an absolute basis, new customer starts in the type 2 space remains strong. Our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom\u2019s G7 and Abbott\u2019s Libre systems, as well as our iOS integration efforts continues to progress very well. I want to take a moment to congratulate Abbott on their recent Libre 2 and Libre 3 iCGM clearance milestones. That is quite an accomplishment. Both of our CGM partners have made exciting progress and we\u2019re thrilled to be advancing our development efforts with both for the benefit of our current and future customers. We believe we offer the best AID system on the market and adding CGM of choice for our current as well as future customers will only strengthen that value proposition. Moving on to our international operations where we are excited to introduce Omnipod 5 in the UK in the middle of this year and in Germany in the fall, and we are currently training HCPs in both markets. This marks the first time we\u2019re bringing a cloud connected Omnipod device to international markets, delivering the benefits of near real-time data management to our customers and HCPs. Our launch of Omnipod 5 in these countries marks the beginning of our stage international rollout with a broader rollout across our international markets next year. Another one of our competitive moats is our global manufacturing capabilities, which are critical to our long-term growth plan and ability to fulfill our mission. While we continue to navigate some challenging macro-related headwinds, we are securing components and producing pods ahead of forecasted demand levels, ensuring global supply for our expanding customer base. Additionally, we are making great progress building our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will further strengthen our global capabilities. We are on target with our build schedule and expect to take possession of the facility by the end of this year, placing us on track to begin manufacturing in 2024. Earlier this week we published our 2022 sustainability report noting exciting progress across a number of environmental, social and governance initiatives. As a result of all of our initiatives, we were named by Newsweek as one of America\u2019s most responsible companies for 2023. This past quarter, we also were pleased to be added to the S&P 500. This is a fantastic achievement for Insulet and speaks to the hard work and dedication of our entire global team as well as the success we are having growing the company and executing our mission. Before I turn the call over to Wayde, I want to comment on the changes to our organizational structure we announced this afternoon. Our business is enjoying incredible momentum and we are confident we can build on that. Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management and we are just getting started. Omnipod 5 is a revolutionary offering, delivering the most convenient therapy experience with world-class clinical outcomes as our results clearly demonstrate. And Omnipod 5 is also novel because it gives us the opportunity to use cloud connectivity and data to constantly improve all aspects of the end-to-end customer experience. In addition to that, we are now the market leaders in the type 2 space and we have a huge opportunity to expand there with the portfolio of therapy options. And of course, we are early in our efforts to expand internationally. In order to capture those opportunities and reach the millions of patients that need our help, we\u2019ve decided to make some changes to how we operate. It has been almost a year since I assumed the CEO role and I could not be more proud of how well our team continues to execute. Over that time, we\u2019ve taken a close look at our organizational structure and working processes and in order to both continue our momentum and capture the full palette of opportunities we see for growth, we need to do three things, elevate and integrate our technology stack and especially our cloud and data analytics capabilities, invest in regional and local markets to drive growth and expansion and most importantly, get even closer to our customers and orient the entire organization around the end-to-end customer experience. Therefore, as we announced earlier today, we have created two new roles in the organization effective July 1. The first is Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer responsible for product vision and execution, including franchise management, product management and driving the end-to-end customer experience across the enterprise. Eric Benjamin, our Executive Vice President of Innovation and Strategy will take on this new role. The second is Chief Technology Officer responsible for software and hardware engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, digital and data services and system architecture. Mark Field, our Group Vice President of Software Engineering will step into this new role. On behalf of the entire Insulet team, I\u2019d like to congratulate Eric and Mark and thank each of them for their leadership. We also announced that in order to more effectively drive growth in our international markets, we are transitioning from a structure that had a Global Chief Commercial Officer role to one with two distinct commercial leaders, one for U.S. and another for international. As a result of that decision, Bret Christensen is leaving Insulet on May 5 to pursue other opportunities. He has agreed to provide consulting services during the transition period. We want to thank Bret for everything he has accomplished during his time at Insulet. He played an important role in so many key milestones for us, including our moving to the pharmacy channel and of course the launch of Omnipod 5. We wish Bret all the best and I know he wishes us all the best as he\u2019s here today with us on the call as well. Thank you, Bret. I\u2019m confident that the refinements we are making to our organization structure will help us to not only continue our terrific momentum, but also improve our efficiency, speed our time to market with new innovations and accelerate our growth in international markets. I look forward to continuing to work with our entire Insulet team to realize our company\u2019s immense potential and continue to drive our mission to simplify the lives of the millions of people around the world living with diabetes. In closing, the first quarter marked a strong start to what we are confident will be another successful year for Insulet. Omnipod 5 is transforming the market and changing the way that people manage their diabetes. HCPs are adopting and championing Omnipod 5, helping to bring it to the thousands of people with diabetes who benefit from it. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry and innovation. It takes a company-wide effort of all of our employees to generate the growth we are consistently delivering, while investing in our business to drive sustainable growth and value creation for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Wayde.\nWayde McMillan: Thanks, Jim. First quarter results exceeded our expectations and we made further strategic progress. We delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. And in the U.S., they were the second highest of all time, slightly below last quarter\u2019s record. We generated 23% revenue growth in Q1 finishing above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by total global Omnipod growth of 35%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 210 basis point headwind compared to Q1 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 49% exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy where we provide the personal diabetes manager for no charge. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics, unlike prior quarters, resulted in a net headwind for the quarter of $2 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $14 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter, as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand for Omnipod 5 of approximately 8 million and another 8 million reduction associated with actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. Consistent with Q4, our Q1 Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined where 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts, which we expect to be the case on an ongoing basis. This is especially important given our focus on moving increasing volume through the pharmacy channel, which was over 85% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 10% in Q1 exceeding our guidance range driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 620 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was in line with our guidance. Our estimated global attrition increased slightly to approximately 10% in Q1. We estimate international attrition increased to over 10% as a result of continued AID competition, while U.S. attrition improved to under 10%. We estimate global utilization trends remain consistent with seasonal trends. Drug delivery revenue declined 98% within our guidance range. Gross margin was 67.2%, representing an approximate 380 basis point decrease, which included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 30 basis points. Cost of revenue included income of $8 million due to a lower estimated cost associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 64.9%, representing a 610 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of cost due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue. Operating expenses were slightly above our expectations to support higher than expected revenue and we\u2019re higher than Q1 of last year as we further invested in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 5.5% and 13.6% respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $8 million and both were above our expectations due to a higher than anticipated revenue. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $620 million in cash and the full $100 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to range of 21% to 25% and total company revenue growth to 18% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we\u2019re increasing our revenue growth outlook to 27% to 31% driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products, as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model. We continue to expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we are reaffirming expected revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we now estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 200 basis points. Growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds.  As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution from Omnipod 5 in our international markets in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery, we continue to expect a decline of 55% to 45% representing a dollar decline, similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 65% to 66% consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts this year include the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, favorable geographical sales mix and manufacturing improvements. These drivers will be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation. As we\u2019ve said before, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect Q2 gross margin to be near the low end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing volume in the pharmacy channel and improving manufacturing performance. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the phase launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits similar to 2022 levels. We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improve second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion and expect to begin to leverage investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022. Turning to our second quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 29% to 32% and total company growth of 27% to 30%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 37% to 40%. Our growth drivers remain the same. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 13% to 16% driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q1 drug delivery revenue decline of 25% to 20%.  In conclusion, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and operational performance. We achieved a number of milestones this past quarter and are incredibly excited about the year ahead and the opportunities we see to further our mission, improve our customers\u2019 lives and drive value for shareholders. With that operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon guys, and congratulations on the quarter. Bret, we\u2019ll miss talking to you at the meetings, so good luck in your next endeavors. Jim or maybe Wayde, I wanted to look at your international guidance for 2Q. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of questions we could ask about the strength in the U.S. for Omnipod 5. But that 13% to 16% growth, it\u2019s about 400 basis points to 500 basis points above where the Street sitting for 2Q. Obviously, you talked about some increased AID adoption that we all know is going on over there. We\u2019re seeing you talked about the increased attrition. It\u2019s hard for me to reconcile the strength you\u2019re expecting in 2Q and even over the balance of the year there if oh five [ph] is not going to contribute a lot, so what\u2019s going right in the international business? And how are you accelerating that growth given some of those attrition and competitive factors you talked about? Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Yes. Hey, Jeff. We would love to start talking about Omnipod 5, but why don\u2019t we go ahead and talk about international for a second. So as you point out, we had a strong Q1 at 10%, and that\u2019s about what we\u2019ve been performing over the last couple years. 11%, 12% performance over the last couple years, 10% Q1. Q2 does look a little higher, but it\u2019s more just some of the choppiness that we see in the international markets due to the distributor nature. And so we do have a bit of a higher growth rate that we\u2019re planning based on some of the order timing there. If you look at the second half growth rate, it offsets it, and then it looks to drive us in for the full year around the 6% to 10% or just double digits at the high end. And we\u2019ve been performing at that level for the last couple years. We think we can continue to drive that at the high end. Really depends on how the second half performance goes. And as you know, we\u2019re not participating in the AID portion of the market internationally. And so right now, DASH is doing really, really well. Without an AID system, we\u2019re still growing double digits internationally. And as you know, we can\u2019t wait to bring Omnipod 5 first to the UK mid-year and then Germany now in the fall, and then to further countries next year. And so we think we\u2019ll significantly improve our performance even above the double digits we\u2019re at now once we get Omnipod 5 and our AID system into that market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I can\u2019t help but ask about your congrats on a really good quarter here. I can\u2019t help but ask about the comment you made about over 70% penetration of pumps in the type one population. I guess, could you put some timing around that? What do you think needs to get done to make pumps standard of care? It has moved relatively slowly and it is interesting to see that your 80/20 split has gone to 70/30 with Omnipod 5, which suggests that a higher proportion are coming from competitive pumps? Thanks for taking the question.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats on the quarter. We\u2019re very happy with the quarter too. Yes, I think the key point, we don\u2019t have a timeframe on that overall pump penetration. I think the key point we\u2019re trying to make is that Omnipod 5, the Omnipod platform and especially Omnipod 5, are fundamentally different and better from tube pump offerings that were first introduced into the market. And because of that, they\u2019re so simple to use that as the market goes through a learning curve, we firmly believe we\u2019re seeing hints of it all right, right now already, and we firmly believe that more and more people will both consider using a pump, a wearable pump, and more and more doctors will consider putting patients onto an Omnipod 5 platform product that they wouldn\u2019t have considered a year ago. It\u2019s just because the easy use is so high effect. If we go back to ADA last year, one of our investigators finished his talk about Omnipod with the statement that given this offering, it\u2019s now the case that everybody in the market should be considered for pump therapy. And so we think that those penetration models, which everybody has been talking about and banging [ph] around numbers for quite a long time, are really obsolete. We think that Omnipod 5 is going to bring more and more people to market. That\u2019s going to be true in type one where CGM is already very well penetrated and has paved the road for us. We think it\u2019ll be even truer for us in the type two market because people with type two diabetes have such a burden in managing their disease. It\u2019s very difficult for them to get approved for insulin pumps. It\u2019s very difficult for them to manage everything they\u2019re doing along with the tube insulin pump. We think the simplicity of Omnipod 5 is going to drive penetration on that market as well. We see it as a huge opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. And congrats on a really nice quarter. For my question, Omnipod 5 is clearly doing great. It\u2019s taken share, record new patients in a first quarter, just below a fantastic fourth quarter. So I think the current momentum isn\u2019t it question here, but as we look forward, you are having guidance growth slowing a bit, really wanted to get your sense on how you think about balancing, bringing in those new patients that are not using a pump right now versus some competitive entrance, particularly Medtronic 780G and Tandem\u2019s Mobi that\u2019s coming later this year. And how you think the trajectory of new patient ads can continue not just in the short term, but over the next, let\u2019s say five years or so? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Robbie. We\u2019re really bullish on the coming five years for our business and for our growth trajectory. And the mix of the \u2013 mix of patience for us MDI versus competitor, has moved a little bit in the quarter and that sort of thing. I\u2019ll just say a couple of things. The first one is we have the best offer on the market. So if you\u2019re just thinking competitive, sort of the three main competitors in the market. Our offering is clearly superior. We\u2019re clearly winning in the market right now. We\u2019re taking \u2013 we\u2019re bringing a lot of people out of MDI into the market, and we\u2019re taking competitive share and driving competitive switching, which continues to run ahead of our historic pattern and ahead of frankly our expectations and in terms of competitive switching. But we don\u2019t think about the market that way. The way we think about the market is not as a zero sum game amongst the pump players. We think of the market as a market with literally tens of millions of people that need insulin therapy that need a much simpler solution. And so our entire offer is geared to bring people off of multiple daily injections and all of the burden of multiple daily injections into a simple wearable, disposable, waterproof pump. That requires them to not have to do a lot of calculations, don\u2019t do finger sticks and just manage their condition that way. And so we\u2019re extremely bullish. We have a very clear lead on the whole package. We have a fantastic algorithm. And the whole package for Omnipod 5 is so simple. The wear experience is simple. The channel access is simple. The economics are great for patients. The economics are great for payers. So overall, we\u2019re extremely bullish on the ongoing growth. And given our lead, we\u2019re just going to extend that lead. We have tons of innovation coming in the pipeline and our reorganization is going to allow us to move even faster with that. So we think our \u2013 we love the momentum we have right now. We intend to continue it, and we think the midterm, long-term outlook is really, really strong for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the question. Two questions. How should we think about drug delivery over time? Does this essentially go to zero? And then the second question is, ADA is coming up. What should we be looking forward to? Thank you.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Joanne. I'll take a shot at both of those, but I'll invite either way or Bret to comment and give some color. So, first one, on drug delivery, look, we \u2013 that's a \u2013 that's been a great business for us. It's because \u2013 as we grow, as Omnipod 5 grows in particular, it's becoming less and less material for us. And \u2013 but we've really enjoyed delivering that product to our partner at Amgen. And we know that product makes a difference in people's lives in that therapy area. That business is lumpy for us and has been. And so, we expect that to continue to decline. I don't know, Wayde, if we're going to guide on it dropping a zero, I, we expect some revenues and we've made some progress there, so I'll turn that to Wayde. But first let me comment on ADA. Yes, we're excited about ADA. ADA is in San Diego this year. I think you all know that. I'm based in San Diego. So it's right here in my backyard. Very excited for it to be here. We will be bringing more real world evidence publications to ADA. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type one usage. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type two usage. We're really excited to build on what we showed at ATTD this year. And as I've said in the past, and you've heard us say in the past, we think that the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5 puts us in a unique position to be able to have insights into real usage cases across the population of people using the Omnipod 5 pump. So we'll be showing more exciting data at ADA, and we hope you'll come and see us. Wayde?\nWayde McMillan: So just, Jim covered it really well. I'll just add quickly on the drug delivery side of things. We have a great partnership with Amgen, and we're very proud of the fact that our technology combined with their product has really helped them continue to sell their product and defend against biosimilars given our delivery device. And so we do think it's going to have a long tail, Joanne, we would expect it to be several years, if not five or more years, that will continue to provide the product for them. We're not going to guide, as Jim said, it's a lumpy business just based on the order patterns. But we think we'll continue to provide that product. The overall strategy for the drug delivery business has not changed for us, although there are many growth options for us there. We are laser focused on the diabetes side of the business. And we've got so many investment opportunities to grow the diabetes side of the business and invest and create value that we are just not turning our focus to drug delivery at this time. But it still remains as growth options for us out there in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Larry's question and maybe push a little bit more on that 70% plus market penetration. But maybe tie it to some of the comments around the organizational change. First of all, Bret, congratulations on everything you've accomplished. It's been awesome working with you. And hopefully, our paths cross again, but you deserve everything that you've done. But maybe as we think about kind of that market penetration, there's a lot of T1D patients that maybe don't routinely go to an endo. You talked about getting closer to the patient. I think you talked about both regional, local offices. But Jim, you're a strategist. I've seen your work. So is this a commercial effort to try to get into the PCPs? Is there a more virtual way of doing that? How are you guys thinking about it as you think about that 70%? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Margaret, for the question. It's a great question. We think \u2013 first thing I'll say is it's \u2013 the logic of it is such that, right. So to me, the Omnipod 5 offering is just so compelling that \u2013 and what we see when we have patient feedback is the ease of usage is so high, and we get these messages from patients literally every day. And we think it's just \u2013 there's a compelling logic for people to be using Omnipod 5 instead of MDI. And it's a better life experience. It's better outcomes with MDI. And so just on the weight of that, it's really important. I'll point out that there are many endo practices right now, where more than 70% of their type 1 users are on a pump, and most of them are on Omnipod 5, right. And so Omnipod 5 has allowed them to bring more of their patients on to Omnipod 5 therapy. And so we see that playing out. But if I just pick up on the other side of your question, which is around channel, a couple of things that I think are just really powerful for us. So the first one is we certainly know, we know that there are PCPs out there who already are heavy writers, obviously have a big part of their focus on treating people with insulin therapy, treating people with diabetes. We have those mapped. We periodically call on them. With Omnipod GO, that's going to be an even more important part of our business. And part of what we'll be doing as we do commercial pilots is figuring out the mix of how we call on those kind of \"high writers\" in the PCP market. But Omnipod 5's simplicity will also help PCPs feel comfort in writing. And we're seeing an expansion of people who write prescriptions for Omnipod 5. So just \u2013 just put some numbers to that. We've said \u2013 you've heard us say before that physicians are increasingly comfortable with writing prescriptions for Omnipod 5, and we've seen that learning curve go through the market. In this quarter, we had more than 11,000 health care practitioners who wrote a script for Omnipod 5. And that's in a market where there are just about 7,000 endocrinologists out in the market. So more than 11,000 people writing for Omnipod 5. So we see a lot of evidence that we're going to be able to do exactly what we set out to do as a company when we found it, which is bring a simple, really simplifying offer broadly to the market that's easy for patients to use and easy for physicians to prescribe and easy for people to get access to and get set up on. So we're very bullish on driving more and more penetration, bringing more people in the market. Our play is a growth play. It's not a competitive switching play. And I think that's really important.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I would just love to hear a little bit more about integrating with G7 and Libre 2 and 3, just general thoughts on timing there. Do you think you'll be second in the AID market with both of those new CGM products? And then any kind of commentary just as far as what opportunity you see with accessing Libre patients. To me, it seems most likely that they would probably go with O5 if they do decide to go on a pump. Just any kind of general commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. We continue to work really closely with both Dexcom and Abbott, our 2 great CGM partners. We're really pleased to see their continued technology advancements in the market. We were excited to see G7 approved earlier in the year. And as we said and as I said in our prepared comments, we congratulate Abbott on getting both Libre 2 and Libre 3 cleared as iCGM. That's a big accomplishment. So we're very excited to bring sensor of choice to all of our customers as soon as we can. We're making great progress with both partners on completing those integrations. And we haven't guided on timing. I'm not going to speak to what our competitors are going to do, but we're moving as fast as we can. And we're excited to bring those innovations to market just as quickly as we can. In terms of \u2013 there's \u2013 you've got two big players out there. So your question about penetration in different sensors and who will choose what, we think Omnipod 5 is the best offer in the market. We think it's going to be the best offer for anybody wearing any sensor, which is why we want to bring choice to all of those customers and all of those patients. It's obvious that between those two players, they have millions of patients out there that are already using their sensors. And for us, that creates a kind of a \u2013 I think I've said \u2013 I've used this metaphor before on these calls. I used to go fishing with my dad. He would always say, well, let's go to the pond that they just stocked with the trout. So as we get out there, we're fishing in a stocked pond. And so they've been paving the road for us. There's lots and lots of patients out there that both of our partners are delivering terrific, wearable on-body experiences in managing their diabetes. And we think that Omnipod 5 will very seamlessly slide into that on-body experience and provide great solutions to people wearing both Dexcom and Libre sensors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for the question and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe a quick clarification for Wayde. I wanted to make sure we had the numbers right on the stock, destock this quarter. It looks like the net impact would have been a negative $2 million headwind, so U.S. growth, 50% in Q1. So I wanted to make sure I had those numbers right. And then the question is really on the guide up in Q2. I don't know if that's what you're seeing in April, if it's really the strong Q1 you that had. And then \u2013 and how to think about the second half because it looks like the second half guide is about mid-teens growth, which looks conservative at this point. I just want to make sure I understand the flow of the year for the U.S. growth.\nWayde McMillan: Hey Travis, yes. I'm glad you asked because we do have these dynamics with Omnipod 5 as we ramp up. And as you know, we haven't annualized yet. This is just our third quarter ramping with Omnipod 5. And so it does cause some unique dynamics. And we experienced similar stocking. Majority of the $14 million we called out is due to our existing \u2013 moving from either Classic Omnipod or DASH onto our new Omnipod 5 system. And when they do that, some customers will get their starter kit and their first reorder in the pharmacy and that creates a onetime volume benefit. We also benefit from new customers who have that same dynamic and then, to a much lesser extent, a small build in the retail pharmacies as retail pharmacies start to stock Omnipod 5 as their foot traffic increases with the rollout. What \u2013 so that ended up with $14 million, which is very similar to the $16 million and the $15 million we've had in the last two quarters. What was unique this quarter and added to that, that resulted in a net small headwind, as you mentioned, a $2 million headwind, was the return reserve that we had to put up. So this is a new dynamic for us as the pharmacy channels are switching over from DASH and Classic Omnipod to Omnipod 5, and they're doing it at such an accelerated rate that they have the contractual right to return to us the prior products. And so we set up a reserve. We saw that increase here in Q1. So a portion of that is actuals in the quarter. The rest is a reserve for what we estimate to come throughout the rest of the year. So those are the major drivers for us, including a days-on-hand decrease. And this is for the Omnipod 5 business. And of course, we don't control the inventory levels at our wholesalers. And their inventory goes up and down from time to time. Just a reminder that in Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million channel increase for Omnipod 5. So in some respects, this is just giving that back and leveling out the channel here. It took a few quarters for that to happen. So we're going to keep a close eye on it, but we want to make sure whenever we see a change, material change in days on hand, we call it out for you all. And then in reference to the guide, Travis, we do see really strong momentum. We've set record new customer starts in the U.S. for multiple quarters. And so that's what gives us confidence in raising the growth rate for Q2. And then comparatively, when you're looking at first half to second half growth percentages, the second half is when we annualize Omnipod 5 from the prior year. And so it's a much tougher comp. And then inside of that, we have our remaining customers converting from Classic and DASH to Omnipod 5, which will start to ramp down in the second half of this year, and we think we'll be through most of the eligible customers to convert. And so we won't get as much benefit in the second half of this year as we did in the second half of last year. And so that compounds the tough comp a bit. But if you're looking at the pure growth rates on an extrapolated basis, for the U.S., we're looking at the second half in \u2013 at the high end, over 20%, low 20s growth rate at the high end. And so that's what we're focused on, continuing to drive the business, even with a tougher comp, well over 20%. And so that's the major dynamics. We've got plenty of year to go yet. So we increased the second half growth rate because we've got good line of sight to that given our annuity model. We're going to continue to monitor the second half, and we'll provide further updates as we go throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to spend a minute on Omnipod GO and the path forward there. Can you walk us through some of the key milestones between now and when you think it will be ready for a commercial launch? And in particular, I'm curious about coverage and market access because I know you've highlighted those as gating factors before. So are there some studies you want to run? Or anything else that's going to get done this year to get you ready for next year? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Chris. Obviously, we received clearance for Omnipod GO, which is one of the poles in the tent. We're really excited to get that in such an expeditious way. It's terrific. There's other things that we need to get in place to make sure that we can launch at scale. As you said, one of the main ones is reimbursement. And so we announced when we filed Omnipod GO, actually, if you guys remember just before we filed Omnipod GO, because we wanted to be able to go to payers and start to talk about coverage. And those conversations are going, they're going pretty well. And we expect to be able to have broad enough coverage to launch certainly in 2024. And then the other things we have to figure out is Omnipod GO is a new-to-world offer. So it's in the Omnipod product form factor, but it has no controller, it doesn't take a CGM feed. So it's very, very simple to use. It's a multiple SKU product because each SKU will have a basal rate associated with it. So the way we've designed it is a physician would write a prescription for Omnipod GO 10 units or something very simple like that. But we need to go out and make sure that the customer experience is \u2013 we fully understand the customer experience of getting that new-to-world product, and we fully understand the physician experience of writing it and making sure there's appropriate access for everybody. So we'll be doing some pilots to test out those models, to test market reaction and test customer experience and so on. And when we're confident we have those right, we'll move to a commercial launch. We're not gating them on a date. We're not holding back the date. We want to make sure we're ready to launch the experience that we want to deliver to all of our customers, including both patients and health care providers. And we're moving pretty quickly, so we'll move as quickly as we can, but we're going to continue to guide to 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Cronin: Hi. This is Caitlin on for Kyle. Congrats on a great quarter. Just to kind of go off of the GO question earlier, have you begun enrollment on the T2 pivotal study? And can you kind of remind us of the time lines for the study? And then U.S. customer starts coming from Q2, where do you really think this could go in the future as you kind of gear up GO in the longer term? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Caitlin. The Omnipod 5 type 2 pivotal is going really well. And just as a reminder, I think we said in the comments, too, today that it's intended to be up to 350 patients across 20 sites in the U.S. And we're already enrolling that, and enrollment is going really well. We have both patients and investigators are really keen to be in that study. And so enrollment is going really, really well. We're really excited about it. And we haven't put a time line on it for everybody, but I'm sure everybody understands what happens is we have to \u2013 that's a 90 day \u2013 every patient is in the trial for 90 days. So you enroll the patients. Each patient stays in the trial for 90 days, and so there\u2019s a rolling cadence of the patients being in the trial, then the last patient completes, then you gather the data, then you clean the data, then you analyze the data and then when that\u2019s already, we send it into the hands of the FDA. So there\u2019s multiple steps we have to go through. We haven\u2019t put a timeline on that. But we\u2019re very confident first that it\u2019s moving pretty quickly. And second, we\u2019re really confident in the results. You\u2019re doing a trial because you have to get the results to finish the trial. But we know from our feasibility study that we published last year that the results for Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 are terrific, really terrific time in range and significant reduction in actual daily dose of insulin, which is a benefit both to patients and to payers. So we\u2019re very bullish on that. The overall \u2013 when you think about the overall landscape, we\u2019re already the leader in type 2 with DASH. We continue to have and enjoy a lot of new customer starts. As a percentage of our new customer starts, most of those are coming onto DASH because that\u2019s where we have an indication for use. So we\u2019re already the market leader in insulin pump therapy with Omnipod DASH. We know we\u2019re getting off-label usage right now for people with type 2 diabetes using Omnipod 5. We don\u2019t promote Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 diabetes, but physicians write it, physicians prescribe it. And so we know we\u2019re seeing that already, which is also an early indication of success for us and we really would love to be able to promote it, which is why we want to get the indication for use. And then Omnipod GO is upstream of intensive insulin therapy. So Omnipod GO designed to really simplify management of their condition for people with type 2 diabetes who are on basal only, which is how most people in the U.S. initiate insulin therapy on a basal rate. So by launching Omnipod GO, we move upstream. We simplified basal rate insulin therapy for people initiating, and then as their needs progress, they\u2019re already used to the Omnipod form factor, how to put on a patch, how to use an Omnipod product. And when they need intensive insulin therapy, we anticipate it being very seamless for them to slide onto. If it\u2019s going to happen tomorrow would be on to DASH, but the timing will probably be such that most of those patients will be progressing onto an Omnipod 5 product once it gets its indication for use. So we think we have a terrific portfolio of offerings already in type 2 and we\u2019re really excited to continue to drive growth in that market and drive solutions for people living with types 2 diabetes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Hi. Good afternoon. I\u2019ll be quick here. On the RCT, you mentioned that it would support premium pricing. I just wanted to clarify is that premium pricing relative to tube pumps or premium pricing relative to your current offering in Europe?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Jayson. Our intent is to deliver enough evidence into various markets such that we can go and secure reimbursement that we think is more in line with the value that we deliver with Omnipod 5. We think Omnipod 5 delivers a lot of value through its improved patient experience and improved outcomes. And so \u2013 and those negotiations are going and will go market by market. And so I think that what you\u2019ll see is we\u2019ll probably have slightly different reimbursements and slightly different levels of premium in any given market depending on what we\u2019re able to prove to those state payers and what we\u2019re able to negotiate over time. We may be also able to ramp reimbursement over time as we\u2019re able to deliver more evidence. But as we\u2019re entering into those conversations, we want to have as much evidence as we possibly can, which is the purpose of that RCT. And as a reminder on that one, it\u2019s a two geography study, it\u2019s U.S. and France. The U.S. \u2013 the last U.S. patient is completed. We have about 75% enrolled patients in France, and we expect that to wrap up in the fall. And then we\u2019ll have that as another era in our quiver of evidence as we go and talk to those payers to secure the \u2013 what we think is fair reimbursement for the value Omnipod 5 creates.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to your comment on the penetration rate, potentially going through 70%, given all your advantages. I wouldn\u2019t dispute that, but you made some interesting comments that you\u2019re starting to kind of see the green shoots of that. And so my question on the follow-up there is what kind of rate of change are you seeing or do you think that we could see driven versus the traditional 75,000 or so MDIs coming to market converting to pump every year in the U.S.? Any thoughts on that?\nWayde McMillan: Matt, it\u2019s Wayde. Happy to take that and I think Jim covered it well, but maybe just a couple things I could add to that. I think as Jim said, one of the best indicators we have is that there are some type 1 endocrinologists that are already have more than 70% of their type 1s on a pump. So that\u2019s a clear early indicator. One of the other things we\u2019re looking at is the pediatric penetration rate, which is much higher than the adult penetration rate, already in excess of 50%. And so that tells us that as the population ages over time, we\u2019re already seeing a higher penetration rate out of the pediatric space. So it\u2019ll just be a natural increase in penetration as the population of people on pumps increases. And of course, we\u2019re the market leader in impedes and really driving that early penetration rate for type 1s. And so the rate of change, I think is a great question that you have. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the market curve develops here. But just one other thing I would add, Jim mentioned that we\u2019re bringing \u2013 we\u2019ve got a chock full list of innovations to bring to market. This early indicator where we see some clinics already over 70%, and that\u2019s before we bring CGM of choice, before we bring iOS, before we bring software and hardware improvements over time. And the competition is also improving their products over time. And so I think between all of us, we\u2019re going to bring great technology for people with diabetes and for our customers here and just going to have much better technology solutions for delivery of insulin. And so that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we can take this to 70% and above. And of course, Jim covered this, but the CGM early indicator, they are paving the way for us in all markets now, even just the basal only market, which is one of the great things about the Omnipod GO program, but just sticking with the type 1 in the U.S. and the pump market given that CGMs are up at 80% today, and we know that we bring more customers to CGM as well, so there\u2019s a lot of other early indicators there that tell us that we can get this penetration to 70% or above over time. But it\u2019s a great question on the rate of change. We\u2019ll see how that market develops. The good news is we have many other growth platforms, obviously our leadership position in type 2 in the U.S. and then our international expansion plans and bringing our Omnipod 5 AID system to international markets, and then of course, expanding our offerings with Omnipod GO in the basal only market. So, lots to get excited about with our innovation pipeline today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys, and congratulations. Wayde, just thinking on gross margin, obviously a lot of moving parts here and you talked to some of that falling into 2024. But thinking over the medium to long-term, just given some of the work you\u2019re doing in expansion in Malaysia, how are you thinking about leveraging that line as you look out over that medium term? How much does international offset that? Just trying to think through the cadence over the next three to five years. Thanks.\nWayde McMillan: Yes, Steven great question to think down the P&L as well, we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum on the top line and we think that we\u2019re going to be adding significant value with gross margin and operating margin expansion over time. Focusing here on the gross margin, and to your question, medium to long-term, we\u2019re not putting numbers on it, but we know we\u2019ve got a lot of tailwinds. We\u2019re not assuming the component higher inflationary costs to improve, but we\u2019re also not assuming they get worse from here. We\u2019re assuming they\u2019ve sort of leveled out and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to live with for some time. And so assuming the inflationary environment then stays flat for us, the built-in benefits that we have with scaling the business, additional volume and the move, the geographic mix of growing the U.S. faster as well as the move into the pharmacy channel is all going to provide us some tailwinds to gross margin. The other side of the coin, what we have to watch is how fast we expand internationally. And just given that we use a distributor model there, our gross margins are sometimes lower. That doesn\u2019t mean our operating margins are lower because we obviously have a lower cost to serve where we use the distributor market there. And so it\u2019s going to be a combination of those things, but we\u2019re not going to put numbers to long-term guidance at this point, but we do think we can continue to grow gross margins over time. And we\u2019ve had a long-term goal of getting to 70%. We still think that\u2019s in view over the medium horizon here. But we just have to manage all of these dynamics continue to improve our manufacturing performance, which is also another driver for us. And that\u2019s going to help us work our way to 70% over time.\nOperator: We have time for one last question. It will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSam Eiber: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Sam Eiber on for Marie. Thanks for taking the questions here and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe I can just ask on OUS, so we\u2019re gearing up for initial market introduction in the UK in the next couple months or so. I guess any other work that\u2019s needed in terms of developing that cloud infrastructure and you mentioned some market preparation. Any more details in terms of what that looks like going on now ahead of some of those launches? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Sam. We\u2019re really pleased. We\u2019re very excited to be bringing Omnipod 5 to the UK and Germany this year. Obviously since we\u2019re really late in stage and readiness there and we\u2019re all ready to launch those products, the cloud infrastructure and those markets is completely ready to go. And we\u2019re training healthcare practitioners right now and our teams are really excited to launch. So we\u2019ll be doing those, as we said in the summer and then \u2013 summer in the UK and then fall in Germany. There is some work to do. The cloud infrastructure is scalable and so we\u2019re in good position in terms of how we\u2019re building that cloud across Europe. There is some specific work market by market to be done. Sometimes it\u2019s technical, sometimes it\u2019s agreement based because the regulations by market are a little bit different in terms of data privacy and security. And the channels are a little bit different. And so you are \u2013 as you step into a market, you\u2019re launching a cloud-based offering, you might have a different agreement with a different hospital system, things like that, that have to be worked through. So those are really the steps that we have to do. But we\u2019re excited to get those launches going in Europe and then really excited to continue to cascade across the international geographies in 2024.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead.\nJim Hollingshead: Great. Thank you everybody. Thanks again for joining us today. Obviously we\u2019re thrilled with our start in 2023 and we\u2019re focused on sustaining that momentum for our entire business both for the rest of the year and beyond. The future for Insulet has never looked brighter, and the future for people with diabetes is incredibly bright. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. We\u2019ll see you then. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're off to a great start to 2023. We entered the year with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business, and the Insulet team continues to execute and deliver on our ambitious expectations. We expect 2023 to be another year of strong growth and strategic progress. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, and today, we increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. We achieved another record first quarter for U.S. revenue growth of 49% and 35% for total Omnipod and once again delivered another record for U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. Omnipod 5 continues to be a driving force of our strong U.S. growth and in Q1, it represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts. This revolutionary offering is transforming diabetes management. Last week, we also received FDA clearance for our basal-only Pod named Omnipod GO. This is a unique product for the type 2 market. It provides us with early entry into treatment pathway, gives physicians and people with diabetes a comfortable non-injection option to deliver and receive insulin and provides patients an improved experience. By eliminating the personal diabetes manager and offering preset levels of basal insulin, we are easing patients into insulin management while leveraging Omnipod's comfortable tubeless technology. We're excited about bringing this innovation to market in 2024. Now to Omnipod 5, which continues to disrupt the diabetes market with its elegance and ease of use as well as consistently impressive real-world outcomes. It has strengthened our position as the market leader by revenue and is rapidly helping us take leadership among new pump prescriptions, thanks to our high share of multiple daily injection new starts and the large number of customer switches from competitive tube offerings. In Q1, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from MDI and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 70/30 split compared to our historical 80/20 mix as a result of the strong number of competitive switches we continue to capture. Omnipod 5's ease-of-use, simplified access, quality of life and strong clinical outcomes, coupled with our team's execution, has positioned us to continue to win across all market segments. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched compared to other AID systems, and the feedback we hear from customers speaks to its unique benefits. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who operates a clinic with almost 3,000 patients across both type 1 and type 2, many of whom use one of our Omnipod solutions. He has hundreds of patients now on Omnipod 5, and he is using it himself. He called Omnipod 5 a \"game changer\" and said, \"Thank you for everything you do. I've waited 40 years for this product, and it's more than what I had hoped for.\" This sentiment is echoed by so many HCPs who tell us that their Omnipod 5 patients span all age groups, including people over the age of 80 who have been on MDI for decades and would never have considered pumps before learning about and experiencing Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Much of this success is a testament to how we designed our system. As we do with all of our innovations, we designed Omnipod 5 with the customer 100% in mind, with a clear focus on how we could simplify each day, improve quality of life and drive better outcomes. We offer an algorithm that provides micro doses every five minutes to adjust the target versus other systems that need to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. Plus with Omnipod 5, there is no need to disconnect. Our algorithm learns, adapts and personalizes for each user. Our users are able to achieve excellent time and range with the lowest incidence of hypoglycemia on the market. The real-world evidence we shared at ATTD with data from more than 31,000 Omnipod 5 users is unmatched by competitors. And we look forward to sharing a larger data set at the ADA Trade Show next month, building on the clinical outcomes and quality of life that only Omnipod 5 can provide. These clinical outcomes, combined with Omnipod 5's form factor and ease of use, are proving to be life-changing for our users. Our market leadership also depends on building awareness of and access to Omnipod, and our team continues to execute with excellence against these objectives. Our efforts to drive access and awareness are critically important, given how underpenetrated the global type 1 and type 2 pump markets are, driving growing need for advanced solutions. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are approximately 11 million people with insulin-intensive diabetes who can benefit from Omnipod. Approximately 45% have type 1 and 55% type 2, and these markets remain vastly underserved. Pump penetration in the U.S. type 1 market is still only approximately 40% and only low single digits in type 2, and international market penetration is much below the U.S. There is a massive unmet need for insulin therapy solutions, which also means we have a massive market opportunity. The Omnipod platform, and especially Omnipod 5, will open that market even further. Prior to Omnipod 5, consensus was there was a natural cap on pump adoption of around 70%, but these estimates have all been built based upon the adoption curve of tubed pumps. You've heard us call Omnipod 5 a game changer, and we believe it changes this game. Omnipod 5's simplicity, ease of use, cost and access and, importantly, outstanding clinical outcomes driven by our advanced algorithm will allow us to bring customers into the market who would have otherwise never considered or never been considered for an insulin pump. We are seeing this in our market feedback already. Additionally, CGM is helping to pave the way by raising awareness for Omnipod and, in turn, we are bringing more people to CGM. Our sources indicate CGM U.S. type 1 market penetration is nearing 80%, making us even more confident in Omnipod 5's potential to grow penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone. The Omnipod platform is quickly becoming the new standard of care for insulin delivery. A critical element to our access strategy is growing our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. This makes access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH much more affordable, convenient and efficient, with low co-pays and the ability to pick up product at the local pharmacy or through mail order with no lock-in periods. And the vast majority of Omnipod 5 prescriptions are filled in a matter of days compared to weeks through the DME channel. In the U.S. market, we price Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH to drive access for Omnipod 5 quickly so we can make it affordable for the large number of people we knew would want it. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it relatively on par with customer costs for multiple daily injections. Combined with no upfront cost to start on Omnipod 5, we invite any patient to experience the difference of Omnipod. Omnipod 5, just like Omnipod DASH is widely covered in the U.S. Our team's customer-centric focus and commitment to operational excellence enabled us to drive incredibly strong coverage for Omnipod 5 in a short period of time, positioning us for the enormous level of affordable broad-based adoption we have seen. And as such, we will no longer provide quarterly coverage updates similar to the approach we took with Omnipod DASH. In practical terms, both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH are now fully covered. Our clinical initiatives continue to progress, including our type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this three month study will be the largest we have ever conducted, including up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes across 20 sites in the U.S. with a targeted focus on recruiting diverse and underserved populations. We began enrollment shortly after our last earnings call and we're making great progress. We're excited to show what Omnipod 5 can do for people with type 2 diabetes. We are also making great progress with our Omnipod 5 three month randomized controlled trial. The last study participant in the U.S. is nearing completion and in France enrollment is nearing completion and we expect the last participant to complete the study by the fall. We believe this RCT study will be beneficial when negotiating access and premium pricing. Both our type 2 pivotal study and our RCT will be valuable additions to the already strong clinical body of evidence that we have been building for Omnipod 5 over the last several years. Fueled by the success of Omnipod 5, our teams are already working on what's coming next. As I mentioned, we received clearance for Omnipod GO in the U.S., which should further build on our type 2 leadership position. We estimate the total addressable market for Omnipod GO is at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We expect to begin a small pilot program this year in select locations and remain on track for a commercial launch in 2024. We have several competitive advantages in the type 2 space, including those that exist for us in the type 1 market, such as our unique form factor and our U.S. pharmacy channel access. In Q1, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. This percentage is lower than historical levels due to the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, which like all AID systems has an indication for only the type 1 market. On an absolute basis, new customer starts in the type 2 space remains strong. Our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems, as well as our iOS integration efforts continues to progress very well. I want to take a moment to congratulate Abbott on their recent Libre 2 and Libre 3 iCGM clearance milestones. That is quite an accomplishment. Both of our CGM partners have made exciting progress and we're thrilled to be advancing our development efforts with both for the benefit of our current and future customers. We believe we offer the best AID system on the market and adding CGM of choice for our current as well as future customers will only strengthen that value proposition. Moving on to our international operations where we are excited to introduce Omnipod 5 in the UK in the middle of this year and in Germany in the fall, and we are currently training HCPs in both markets. This marks the first time we're bringing a cloud connected Omnipod device to international markets, delivering the benefits of near real-time data management to our customers and HCPs. Our launch of Omnipod 5 in these countries marks the beginning of our stage international rollout with a broader rollout across our international markets next year. Another one of our competitive moats is our global manufacturing capabilities, which are critical to our long-term growth plan and ability to fulfill our mission. While we continue to navigate some challenging macro-related headwinds, we are securing components and producing pods ahead of forecasted demand levels, ensuring global supply for our expanding customer base. Additionally, we are making great progress building our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will further strengthen our global capabilities. We are on target with our build schedule and expect to take possession of the facility by the end of this year, placing us on track to begin manufacturing in 2024. Earlier this week we published our 2022 sustainability report noting exciting progress across a number of environmental, social and governance initiatives. As a result of all of our initiatives, we were named by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies for 2023. This past quarter, we also were pleased to be added to the S&P 500. This is a fantastic achievement for Insulet and speaks to the hard work and dedication of our entire global team as well as the success we are having growing the company and executing our mission. Before I turn the call over to Wayde, I want to comment on the changes to our organizational structure we announced this afternoon. Our business is enjoying incredible momentum and we are confident we can build on that. Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management and we are just getting started. Omnipod 5 is a revolutionary offering, delivering the most convenient therapy experience with world-class clinical outcomes as our results clearly demonstrate. And Omnipod 5 is also novel because it gives us the opportunity to use cloud connectivity and data to constantly improve all aspects of the end-to-end customer experience. In addition to that, we are now the market leaders in the type 2 space and we have a huge opportunity to expand there with the portfolio of therapy options. And of course, we are early in our efforts to expand internationally. In order to capture those opportunities and reach the millions of patients that need our help, we've decided to make some changes to how we operate. It has been almost a year since I assumed the CEO role and I could not be more proud of how well our team continues to execute. Over that time, we've taken a close look at our organizational structure and working processes and in order to both continue our momentum and capture the full palette of opportunities we see for growth, we need to do three things, elevate and integrate our technology stack and especially our cloud and data analytics capabilities, invest in regional and local markets to drive growth and expansion and most importantly, get even closer to our customers and orient the entire organization around the end-to-end customer experience. Therefore, as we announced earlier today, we have created two new roles in the organization effective July 1. The first is Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer responsible for product vision and execution, including franchise management, product management and driving the end-to-end customer experience across the enterprise. Eric Benjamin, our Executive Vice President of Innovation and Strategy will take on this new role. The second is Chief Technology Officer responsible for software and hardware engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, digital and data services and system architecture. Mark Field, our Group Vice President of Software Engineering will step into this new role. On behalf of the entire Insulet team, I'd like to congratulate Eric and Mark and thank each of them for their leadership. We also announced that in order to more effectively drive growth in our international markets, we are transitioning from a structure that had a Global Chief Commercial Officer role to one with two distinct commercial leaders, one for U.S. and another for international. As a result of that decision, Bret Christensen is leaving Insulet on May 5 to pursue other opportunities. He has agreed to provide consulting services during the transition period. We want to thank Bret for everything he has accomplished during his time at Insulet. He played an important role in so many key milestones for us, including our moving to the pharmacy channel and of course the launch of Omnipod 5. We wish Bret all the best and I know he wishes us all the best as he's here today with us on the call as well. Thank you, Bret. I'm confident that the refinements we are making to our organization structure will help us to not only continue our terrific momentum, but also improve our efficiency, speed our time to market with new innovations and accelerate our growth in international markets. I look forward to continuing to work with our entire Insulet team to realize our company's immense potential and continue to drive our mission to simplify the lives of the millions of people around the world living with diabetes. In closing, the first quarter marked a strong start to what we are confident will be another successful year for Insulet. Omnipod 5 is transforming the market and changing the way that people manage their diabetes. HCPs are adopting and championing Omnipod 5, helping to bring it to the thousands of people with diabetes who benefit from it. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry and innovation. It takes a company-wide effort of all of our employees to generate the growth we are consistently delivering, while investing in our business to drive sustainable growth and value creation for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats on the quarter. We're very happy with the quarter too. Yes, I think the key point, we don't have a timeframe on that overall pump penetration. I think the key point we're trying to make is that Omnipod 5, the Omnipod platform and especially Omnipod 5, are fundamentally different and better from tube pump offerings that were first introduced into the market. And because of that, they're so simple to use that as the market goes through a learning curve, we firmly believe we're seeing hints of it all right, right now already, and we firmly believe that more and more people will both consider using a pump, a wearable pump, and more and more doctors will consider putting patients onto an Omnipod 5 platform product that they wouldn't have considered a year ago. It's just because the easy use is so high effect. If we go back to ADA last year, one of our investigators finished his talk about Omnipod with the statement that given this offering, it's now the case that everybody in the market should be considered for pump therapy. And so we think that those penetration models, which everybody has been talking about and banging [ph] around numbers for quite a long time, are really obsolete. We think that Omnipod 5 is going to bring more and more people to market. That's going to be true in type one where CGM is already very well penetrated and has paved the road for us. We think it'll be even truer for us in the type two market because people with type two diabetes have such a burden in managing their disease. It's very difficult for them to get approved for insulin pumps. It's very difficult for them to manage everything they're doing along with the tube insulin pump. We think the simplicity of Omnipod 5 is going to drive penetration on that market as well. We see it as a huge opportunity. Thanks, Robbie. We're really bullish on the coming five years for our business and for our growth trajectory. And the mix of the \u2013 mix of patience for us MDI versus competitor, has moved a little bit in the quarter and that sort of thing. I'll just say a couple of things. The first one is we have the best offer on the market. So if you're just thinking competitive, sort of the three main competitors in the market. Our offering is clearly superior. We're clearly winning in the market right now. We're taking \u2013 we're bringing a lot of people out of MDI into the market, and we're taking competitive share and driving competitive switching, which continues to run ahead of our historic pattern and ahead of frankly our expectations and in terms of competitive switching. But we don't think about the market that way. The way we think about the market is not as a zero sum game amongst the pump players. We think of the market as a market with literally tens of millions of people that need insulin therapy that need a much simpler solution. And so our entire offer is geared to bring people off of multiple daily injections and all of the burden of multiple daily injections into a simple wearable, disposable, waterproof pump. That requires them to not have to do a lot of calculations, don't do finger sticks and just manage their condition that way. And so we're extremely bullish. We have a very clear lead on the whole package. We have a fantastic algorithm. And the whole package for Omnipod 5 is so simple. The wear experience is simple. The channel access is simple. The economics are great for patients. The economics are great for payers. So overall, we're extremely bullish on the ongoing growth. And given our lead, we're just going to extend that lead. We have tons of innovation coming in the pipeline and our reorganization is going to allow us to move even faster with that. So we think our \u2013 we love the momentum we have right now. We intend to continue it, and we think the midterm, long-term outlook is really, really strong for us. Thanks, Joanne. I'll take a shot at both of those, but I'll invite either way or Bret to comment and give some color. So, first one, on drug delivery, look, we \u2013 that's a \u2013 that's been a great business for us. It's because \u2013 as we grow, as Omnipod 5 grows in particular, it's becoming less and less material for us. And \u2013 but we've really enjoyed delivering that product to our partner at Amgen. And we know that product makes a difference in people's lives in that therapy area. That business is lumpy for us and has been. And so, we expect that to continue to decline. I don't know, Wayde, if we're going to guide on it dropping a zero, I, we expect some revenues and we've made some progress there, so I'll turn that to Wayde. But first let me comment on ADA. Yes, we're excited about ADA. ADA is in San Diego this year. I think you all know that. I'm based in San Diego. So it's right here in my backyard. Very excited for it to be here. We will be bringing more real world evidence publications to ADA. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type one usage. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type two usage. We're really excited to build on what we showed at ATTD this year. And as I've said in the past, and you've heard us say in the past, we think that the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5 puts us in a unique position to be able to have insights into real usage cases across the population of people using the Omnipod 5 pump. So we'll be showing more exciting data at ADA, and we hope you'll come and see us. Wayde? Thanks, Margaret, for the question. It's a great question. We think \u2013 first thing I'll say is it's \u2013 the logic of it is such that, right. So to me, the Omnipod 5 offering is just so compelling that \u2013 and what we see when we have patient feedback is the ease of usage is so high, and we get these messages from patients literally every day. And we think it's just \u2013 there's a compelling logic for people to be using Omnipod 5 instead of MDI. And it's a better life experience. It's better outcomes with MDI. And so just on the weight of that, it's really important. I'll point out that there are many endo practices right now, where more than 70% of their type 1 users are on a pump, and most of them are on Omnipod 5, right. And so Omnipod 5 has allowed them to bring more of their patients on to Omnipod 5 therapy. And so we see that playing out. But if I just pick up on the other side of your question, which is around channel, a couple of things that I think are just really powerful for us. So the first one is we certainly know, we know that there are PCPs out there who already are heavy writers, obviously have a big part of their focus on treating people with insulin therapy, treating people with diabetes. We have those mapped. We periodically call on them. With Omnipod GO, that's going to be an even more important part of our business. And part of what we'll be doing as we do commercial pilots is figuring out the mix of how we call on those kind of \"high writers\" in the PCP market. But Omnipod 5's simplicity will also help PCPs feel comfort in writing. And we're seeing an expansion of people who write prescriptions for Omnipod 5. So just \u2013 just put some numbers to that. We've said \u2013 you've heard us say before that physicians are increasingly comfortable with writing prescriptions for Omnipod 5, and we've seen that learning curve go through the market. In this quarter, we had more than 11,000 health care practitioners who wrote a script for Omnipod 5. And that's in a market where there are just about 7,000 endocrinologists out in the market. So more than 11,000 people writing for Omnipod 5. So we see a lot of evidence that we're going to be able to do exactly what we set out to do as a company when we found it, which is bring a simple, really simplifying offer broadly to the market that's easy for patients to use and easy for physicians to prescribe and easy for people to get access to and get set up on. So we're very bullish on driving more and more penetration, bringing more people in the market. Our play is a growth play. It's not a competitive switching play. And I think that's really important. Thanks, Matt. We continue to work really closely with both Dexcom and Abbott, our 2 great CGM partners. We're really pleased to see their continued technology advancements in the market. We were excited to see G7 approved earlier in the year. And as we said and as I said in our prepared comments, we congratulate Abbott on getting both Libre 2 and Libre 3 cleared as iCGM. That's a big accomplishment. So we're very excited to bring sensor of choice to all of our customers as soon as we can. We're making great progress with both partners on completing those integrations. And we haven't guided on timing. I'm not going to speak to what our competitors are going to do, but we're moving as fast as we can. And we're excited to bring those innovations to market just as quickly as we can. In terms of \u2013 there's \u2013 you've got two big players out there. So your question about penetration in different sensors and who will choose what, we think Omnipod 5 is the best offer in the market. We think it's going to be the best offer for anybody wearing any sensor, which is why we want to bring choice to all of those customers and all of those patients. It's obvious that between those two players, they have millions of patients out there that are already using their sensors. And for us, that creates a kind of a \u2013 I think I've said \u2013 I've used this metaphor before on these calls. I used to go fishing with my dad. He would always say, well, let's go to the pond that they just stocked with the trout. So as we get out there, we're fishing in a stocked pond. And so they've been paving the road for us. There's lots and lots of patients out there that both of our partners are delivering terrific, wearable on-body experiences in managing their diabetes. And we think that Omnipod 5 will very seamlessly slide into that on-body experience and provide great solutions to people wearing both Dexcom and Libre sensors. Thanks, Chris. Obviously, we received clearance for Omnipod GO, which is one of the poles in the tent. We're really excited to get that in such an expeditious way. It's terrific. There's other things that we need to get in place to make sure that we can launch at scale. As you said, one of the main ones is reimbursement. And so we announced when we filed Omnipod GO, actually, if you guys remember just before we filed Omnipod GO, because we wanted to be able to go to payers and start to talk about coverage. And those conversations are going, they're going pretty well. And we expect to be able to have broad enough coverage to launch certainly in 2024. And then the other things we have to figure out is Omnipod GO is a new-to-world offer. So it's in the Omnipod product form factor, but it has no controller, it doesn't take a CGM feed. So it's very, very simple to use. It's a multiple SKU product because each SKU will have a basal rate associated with it. So the way we've designed it is a physician would write a prescription for Omnipod GO 10 units or something very simple like that. But we need to go out and make sure that the customer experience is \u2013 we fully understand the customer experience of getting that new-to-world product, and we fully understand the physician experience of writing it and making sure there's appropriate access for everybody. So we'll be doing some pilots to test out those models, to test market reaction and test customer experience and so on. And when we're confident we have those right, we'll move to a commercial launch. We're not gating them on a date. We're not holding back the date. We want to make sure we're ready to launch the experience that we want to deliver to all of our customers, including both patients and health care providers. And we're moving pretty quickly, so we'll move as quickly as we can, but we're going to continue to guide to 2024. Thanks, Caitlin. The Omnipod 5 type 2 pivotal is going really well. And just as a reminder, I think we said in the comments, too, today that it's intended to be up to 350 patients across 20 sites in the U.S. And we're already enrolling that, and enrollment is going really well. We have both patients and investigators are really keen to be in that study. And so enrollment is going really, really well. We're really excited about it. And we haven't put a time line on it for everybody, but I'm sure everybody understands what happens is we have to \u2013 that's a 90 day \u2013 every patient is in the trial for 90 days. So you enroll the patients. Each patient stays in the trial for 90 days, and so there's a rolling cadence of the patients being in the trial, then the last patient completes, then you gather the data, then you clean the data, then you analyze the data and then when that's already, we send it into the hands of the FDA. So there's multiple steps we have to go through. We haven't put a timeline on that. But we're very confident first that it's moving pretty quickly. And second, we're really confident in the results. You're doing a trial because you have to get the results to finish the trial. But we know from our feasibility study that we published last year that the results for Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 are terrific, really terrific time in range and significant reduction in actual daily dose of insulin, which is a benefit both to patients and to payers. So we're very bullish on that. The overall \u2013 when you think about the overall landscape, we're already the leader in type 2 with DASH. We continue to have and enjoy a lot of new customer starts. As a percentage of our new customer starts, most of those are coming onto DASH because that's where we have an indication for use. So we're already the market leader in insulin pump therapy with Omnipod DASH. We know we're getting off-label usage right now for people with type 2 diabetes using Omnipod 5. We don't promote Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 diabetes, but physicians write it, physicians prescribe it. And so we know we're seeing that already, which is also an early indication of success for us and we really would love to be able to promote it, which is why we want to get the indication for use. And then Omnipod GO is upstream of intensive insulin therapy. So Omnipod GO designed to really simplify management of their condition for people with type 2 diabetes who are on basal only, which is how most people in the U.S. initiate insulin therapy on a basal rate. So by launching Omnipod GO, we move upstream. We simplified basal rate insulin therapy for people initiating, and then as their needs progress, they're already used to the Omnipod form factor, how to put on a patch, how to use an Omnipod product. And when they need intensive insulin therapy, we anticipate it being very seamless for them to slide onto. If it's going to happen tomorrow would be on to DASH, but the timing will probably be such that most of those patients will be progressing onto an Omnipod 5 product once it gets its indication for use. So we think we have a terrific portfolio of offerings already in type 2 and we're really excited to continue to drive growth in that market and drive solutions for people living with types 2 diabetes. Thanks, Jayson. Our intent is to deliver enough evidence into various markets such that we can go and secure reimbursement that we think is more in line with the value that we deliver with Omnipod 5. We think Omnipod 5 delivers a lot of value through its improved patient experience and improved outcomes. And so \u2013 and those negotiations are going and will go market by market. And so I think that what you'll see is we'll probably have slightly different reimbursements and slightly different levels of premium in any given market depending on what we're able to prove to those state payers and what we're able to negotiate over time. We may be also able to ramp reimbursement over time as we're able to deliver more evidence. But as we're entering into those conversations, we want to have as much evidence as we possibly can, which is the purpose of that RCT. And as a reminder on that one, it's a two geography study, it's U.S. and France. The U.S. \u2013 the last U.S. patient is completed. We have about 75% enrolled patients in France, and we expect that to wrap up in the fall. And then we'll have that as another era in our quiver of evidence as we go and talk to those payers to secure the \u2013 what we think is fair reimbursement for the value Omnipod 5 creates. Thanks, Sam. We're really pleased. We're very excited to be bringing Omnipod 5 to the UK and Germany this year. Obviously since we're really late in stage and readiness there and we're all ready to launch those products, the cloud infrastructure and those markets is completely ready to go. And we're training healthcare practitioners right now and our teams are really excited to launch. So we'll be doing those, as we said in the summer and then \u2013 summer in the UK and then fall in Germany. There is some work to do. The cloud infrastructure is scalable and so we're in good position in terms of how we're building that cloud across Europe. There is some specific work market by market to be done. Sometimes it's technical, sometimes it's agreement based because the regulations by market are a little bit different in terms of data privacy and security. And the channels are a little bit different. And so you are \u2013 as you step into a market, you're launching a cloud-based offering, you might have a different agreement with a different hospital system, things like that, that have to be worked through. So those are really the steps that we have to do. But we're excited to get those launches going in Europe and then really excited to continue to cascade across the international geographies in 2024. Great. Thank you everybody. Thanks again for joining us today. Obviously we're thrilled with our start in 2023 and we're focused on sustaining that momentum for our entire business both for the rest of the year and beyond. The future for Insulet has never looked brighter, and the future for people with diabetes is incredibly bright. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. We'll see you then. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. First quarter results exceeded our expectations and we made further strategic progress. We delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. And in the U.S., they were the second highest of all time, slightly below last quarter's record. We generated 23% revenue growth in Q1 finishing above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by total global Omnipod growth of 35%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 210 basis point headwind compared to Q1 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 49% exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy where we provide the personal diabetes manager for no charge. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics, unlike prior quarters, resulted in a net headwind for the quarter of $2 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $14 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter, as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand for Omnipod 5 of approximately 8 million and another 8 million reduction associated with actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. Consistent with Q4, our Q1 Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined where 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts, which we expect to be the case on an ongoing basis. This is especially important given our focus on moving increasing volume through the pharmacy channel, which was over 85% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 10% in Q1 exceeding our guidance range driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 620 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was in line with our guidance. Our estimated global attrition increased slightly to approximately 10% in Q1. We estimate international attrition increased to over 10% as a result of continued AID competition, while U.S. attrition improved to under 10%. We estimate global utilization trends remain consistent with seasonal trends. Drug delivery revenue declined 98% within our guidance range. Gross margin was 67.2%, representing an approximate 380 basis point decrease, which included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 30 basis points. Cost of revenue included income of $8 million due to a lower estimated cost associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 64.9%, representing a 610 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of cost due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue. Operating expenses were slightly above our expectations to support higher than expected revenue and we're higher than Q1 of last year as we further invested in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 5.5% and 13.6% respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $8 million and both were above our expectations due to a higher than anticipated revenue. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $620 million in cash and the full $100 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to range of 21% to 25% and total company revenue growth to 18% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we're increasing our revenue growth outlook to 27% to 31% driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products, as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model. We continue to expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we are reaffirming expected revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we now estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 200 basis points. Growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds.  As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution from Omnipod 5 in our international markets in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery, we continue to expect a decline of 55% to 45% representing a dollar decline, similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 65% to 66% consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts this year include the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, favorable geographical sales mix and manufacturing improvements. These drivers will be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation. As we've said before, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect Q2 gross margin to be near the low end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing volume in the pharmacy channel and improving manufacturing performance. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the phase launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits similar to 2022 levels. We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improve second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion and expect to begin to leverage investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022. Turning to our second quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 29% to 32% and total company growth of 27% to 30%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 37% to 40%. Our growth drivers remain the same. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 13% to 16% driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q1 drug delivery revenue decline of 25% to 20%.  In conclusion, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and operational performance. We achieved a number of milestones this past quarter and are incredibly excited about the year ahead and the opportunities we see to further our mission, improve our customers' lives and drive value for shareholders. With that operator, please open the call for questions. Yes. Hey, Jeff. We would love to start talking about Omnipod 5, but why don't we go ahead and talk about international for a second. So as you point out, we had a strong Q1 at 10%, and that's about what we've been performing over the last couple years. 11%, 12% performance over the last couple years, 10% Q1. Q2 does look a little higher, but it's more just some of the choppiness that we see in the international markets due to the distributor nature. And so we do have a bit of a higher growth rate that we're planning based on some of the order timing there. If you look at the second half growth rate, it offsets it, and then it looks to drive us in for the full year around the 6% to 10% or just double digits at the high end. And we've been performing at that level for the last couple years. We think we can continue to drive that at the high end. Really depends on how the second half performance goes. And as you know, we're not participating in the AID portion of the market internationally. And so right now, DASH is doing really, really well. Without an AID system, we're still growing double digits internationally. And as you know, we can't wait to bring Omnipod 5 first to the UK mid-year and then Germany now in the fall, and then to further countries next year. And so we think we'll significantly improve our performance even above the double digits we're at now once we get Omnipod 5 and our AID system into that market. So just, Jim covered it really well. I'll just add quickly on the drug delivery side of things. We have a great partnership with Amgen, and we're very proud of the fact that our technology combined with their product has really helped them continue to sell their product and defend against biosimilars given our delivery device. And so we do think it's going to have a long tail, Joanne, we would expect it to be several years, if not five or more years, that will continue to provide the product for them. We're not going to guide, as Jim said, it's a lumpy business just based on the order patterns. But we think we'll continue to provide that product. The overall strategy for the drug delivery business has not changed for us, although there are many growth options for us there. We are laser focused on the diabetes side of the business. And we've got so many investment opportunities to grow the diabetes side of the business and invest and create value that we are just not turning our focus to drug delivery at this time. But it still remains as growth options for us out there in the future. Hey Travis, yes. I'm glad you asked because we do have these dynamics with Omnipod 5 as we ramp up. And as you know, we haven't annualized yet. This is just our third quarter ramping with Omnipod 5. And so it does cause some unique dynamics. And we experienced similar stocking. Majority of the $14 million we called out is due to our existing \u2013 moving from either Classic Omnipod or DASH onto our new Omnipod 5 system. And when they do that, some customers will get their starter kit and their first reorder in the pharmacy and that creates a onetime volume benefit. We also benefit from new customers who have that same dynamic and then, to a much lesser extent, a small build in the retail pharmacies as retail pharmacies start to stock Omnipod 5 as their foot traffic increases with the rollout. What \u2013 so that ended up with $14 million, which is very similar to the $16 million and the $15 million we've had in the last two quarters. What was unique this quarter and added to that, that resulted in a net small headwind, as you mentioned, a $2 million headwind, was the return reserve that we had to put up. So this is a new dynamic for us as the pharmacy channels are switching over from DASH and Classic Omnipod to Omnipod 5, and they're doing it at such an accelerated rate that they have the contractual right to return to us the prior products. And so we set up a reserve. We saw that increase here in Q1. So a portion of that is actuals in the quarter. The rest is a reserve for what we estimate to come throughout the rest of the year. So those are the major drivers for us, including a days-on-hand decrease. And this is for the Omnipod 5 business. And of course, we don't control the inventory levels at our wholesalers. And their inventory goes up and down from time to time. Just a reminder that in Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million channel increase for Omnipod 5. So in some respects, this is just giving that back and leveling out the channel here. It took a few quarters for that to happen. So we're going to keep a close eye on it, but we want to make sure whenever we see a change, material change in days on hand, we call it out for you all. And then in reference to the guide, Travis, we do see really strong momentum. We've set record new customer starts in the U.S. for multiple quarters. And so that's what gives us confidence in raising the growth rate for Q2. And then comparatively, when you're looking at first half to second half growth percentages, the second half is when we annualize Omnipod 5 from the prior year. And so it's a much tougher comp. And then inside of that, we have our remaining customers converting from Classic and DASH to Omnipod 5, which will start to ramp down in the second half of this year, and we think we'll be through most of the eligible customers to convert. And so we won't get as much benefit in the second half of this year as we did in the second half of last year. And so that compounds the tough comp a bit. But if you're looking at the pure growth rates on an extrapolated basis, for the U.S., we're looking at the second half in \u2013 at the high end, over 20%, low 20s growth rate at the high end. And so that's what we're focused on, continuing to drive the business, even with a tougher comp, well over 20%. And so that's the major dynamics. We've got plenty of year to go yet. So we increased the second half growth rate because we've got good line of sight to that given our annuity model. We're going to continue to monitor the second half, and we'll provide further updates as we go throughout the year. Matt, it's Wayde. Happy to take that and I think Jim covered it well, but maybe just a couple things I could add to that. I think as Jim said, one of the best indicators we have is that there are some type 1 endocrinologists that are already have more than 70% of their type 1s on a pump. So that's a clear early indicator. One of the other things we're looking at is the pediatric penetration rate, which is much higher than the adult penetration rate, already in excess of 50%. And so that tells us that as the population ages over time, we're already seeing a higher penetration rate out of the pediatric space. So it'll just be a natural increase in penetration as the population of people on pumps increases. And of course, we're the market leader in impedes and really driving that early penetration rate for type 1s. And so the rate of change, I think is a great question that you have. It's going to be interesting to see how the market curve develops here. But just one other thing I would add, Jim mentioned that we're bringing \u2013 we've got a chock full list of innovations to bring to market. This early indicator where we see some clinics already over 70%, and that's before we bring CGM of choice, before we bring iOS, before we bring software and hardware improvements over time. And the competition is also improving their products over time. And so I think between all of us, we're going to bring great technology for people with diabetes and for our customers here and just going to have much better technology solutions for delivery of insulin. And so that's what gives us the confidence that we can take this to 70% and above. And of course, Jim covered this, but the CGM early indicator, they are paving the way for us in all markets now, even just the basal only market, which is one of the great things about the Omnipod GO program, but just sticking with the type 1 in the U.S. and the pump market given that CGMs are up at 80% today, and we know that we bring more customers to CGM as well, so there's a lot of other early indicators there that tell us that we can get this penetration to 70% or above over time. But it's a great question on the rate of change. We'll see how that market develops. The good news is we have many other growth platforms, obviously our leadership position in type 2 in the U.S. and then our international expansion plans and bringing our Omnipod 5 AID system to international markets, and then of course, expanding our offerings with Omnipod GO in the basal only market. So, lots to get excited about with our innovation pipeline today. Yes, Steven great question to think down the P&L as well, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line and we think that we're going to be adding significant value with gross margin and operating margin expansion over time. Focusing here on the gross margin, and to your question, medium to long-term, we're not putting numbers on it, but we know we've got a lot of tailwinds. We're not assuming the component higher inflationary costs to improve, but we're also not assuming they get worse from here. We're assuming they've sort of leveled out and that's what we're going to live with for some time. And so assuming the inflationary environment then stays flat for us, the built-in benefits that we have with scaling the business, additional volume and the move, the geographic mix of growing the U.S. faster as well as the move into the pharmacy channel is all going to provide us some tailwinds to gross margin. The other side of the coin, what we have to watch is how fast we expand internationally. And just given that we use a distributor model there, our gross margins are sometimes lower. That doesn't mean our operating margins are lower because we obviously have a lower cost to serve where we use the distributor market there. And so it's going to be a combination of those things, but we're not going to put numbers to long-term guidance at this point, but we do think we can continue to grow gross margins over time. And we've had a long-term goal of getting to 70%. We still think that's in view over the medium horizon here. But we just have to manage all of these dynamics continue to improve our manufacturing performance, which is also another driver for us. And that's going to help us work our way to 70% over time."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our third quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis, with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and achieved several outstanding milestones throughout our business. I am proud of what our team accomplishes every day to create better health outcomes for our customers, set new standards in the management of diabetes and drive success across our organization. The robust momentum we saw in the first half of this year has carried into the back half, putting us on track to close out another impressive year and generate over $2 billion in full year revenue for the first time in Insulet's history. Near the end of August, we received FDA clearance for type 2 label expansion for Omnipod 5, which is a testament to the strength of our submission and powerful clinical data. We are excited about our opportunity in the type 2 diabetes market and building upon our strong established foundation for long-term growth. In the third quarter, our global new customer starts grew sequentially and over prior year. This included sequential growth in the U.S. in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. Internationally, our strong momentum also continued with stable sequential new customer starts, proof of the robust demand we are seeing for Omnipod 5, considering the typical seasonality that occurs during the slower summer months in our international markets. Omnipod 5 is winning in every market in which it is offered, and Omnipod is now the #1 insulin pump for new pump users in Europe. We remain confident in our expectation of sequential and year-over-year new customer starts growth for both the U.S. and International in the fourth quarter. We have a clear strategy focused on expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, driving growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and the type 2 and accelerating international growth and expansion. Our recent milestones are key indicators of the progress we continue to make and the momentum across our organization to achieve our strategic goals. And this momentum is reflected in our strong financial results. In Q3, we achieved our highest quarter of total revenue dollars, driven by total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 23% and International growth of 35%. And we continue to expand margins as we scale, execute and drive efficiencies across our global business. Ana will take you through the financial details for the quarter and provide an update on guidance. I will focus my remarks on three key areas: first, our type 2 label expansion, the market opportunity and our commercialization plans; second, our cascade of innovation and how it supports our strategy to drive growth in both the U.S. and internationally; and third, our customer base and market leadership. Let me start with our recent type 2 label expansion, which makes Omnipod 5 the first and only AID system indicated for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be. And now we are bringing all the benefits to individuals with type 2 diabetes that we already deliver to those with type 1, namely: unmatched form factor, ease of use, affordability, pay-as-you-go economics and widespread access through the pharmacy channel. All of this, together with CGM integration and compatibility with Android- and iOS-based smartphones and, most importantly, all while delivering great clinical outcomes and quality of life. Omnipod 5's type 2 label expansion further strengthens our growth trajectory. In fact, type 2 users represented over 25% of our U.S. new customer starts in the third quarter as we drove ramping adoption during September. In the U.S., our type 2 indication significantly expands the total addressable market for Insulet by making Omnipod 5 commercially available to approximately 6 million people who live with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes. This market includes 2.5 million people who are insulin intensive and on multiple daily injections. We estimate that market is less than 5% penetrated, with the majority of current users using Omnipod. The other portion of the market includes over 3 million people that use insulin as a basal-only therapy every day. In order to continue expanding our reach to type 2 patients, we are well underway on an initiative to expand our sales force and commercial relationships to align with the immense opportunity at hand. We have begun the process of growing our team in anticipation of type 2 clearance earlier this year, and we continue to expand today. This strategy is consistent with our established U.S. commercial playbook, adding feet on the street to build on our existing relationships with endocrinology practices while also broadening our reach into high-prescribing PCP practices. With this expansion, we expect to reach over 40% of the 2.5 million type 2 insulin-intensive population during 2025. And we will also be able to go deeper into PCP practices, where we are already receiving great inbound interest. Additionally, we continue to complement our direct selling model with DTC. We expect our type 2 label expansion will make our DTC efforts and awareness initiatives even more efficient. Historically, over 50% of our DTC leads are from individuals with type 2 diabetes, and now we can get those customers quickly onto Omnipod 5. We are making all of these investments thoughtfully. And as our Q3 results demonstrate, we are committed to driving further margin expansion. Let me now discuss our cascade of innovation and how we continue to strengthen our market-leading position as we expand our Omnipod 5 platform. Last quarter, we announced the full market release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the U.S., starting with specialty pharmacies, and communicated that we would ramp G7-compatible pods broadly through retail pharmacy channels over the following months. This approach has proven to be very effective, and G7 customer starts have consistently met our targets. I'm happy to announce that G7 pods are now fully available in retail pharmacies, in addition to customers also having the choice of specialty pharmacy, making it even easier to start on Omnipod 5. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the U.S., we are on track to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of the year. We are excited to provide customers' expanding options as we have experienced great success in providing [indiscernible] with the Choice of Sensors in the U.K. and the Netherlands with both Abbott and Dexcom CGM offerings. At the start of last week, we fully launched the Omnipod 5 iOS app in the U.S., in line with our planned timing. Within hours of our app launch, we became the top downloaded medical app in the iOS App Store. Integrated with G6, our app offers enhanced capabilities that are unique and huge timesavers for Podders, such as a custom foods feature that makes mealtime simpler. Early feedback has been extremely positive. We heard from one of our customers who told us, \"Being able to do daily activities and need to carry only my personal smartphone is the smallest piece of normalcy and the biggest relief. I'm sitting here crying just overwhelmed with how much that means. I haven't felt this normal in years, and it means so much.\" The iOS app is just 1 more advancement that allows our customers to enjoy simplicity, freedom and healthier lives through our innovative technology. And as previously communicated, we remain on track to launch the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G7 in the U.S. and are planning to bring this integration to market in the first half of 2025. Internationally, we are making great progress with our recent launches of Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands and, although early, Omnipod 5 is starting to build a growing number of new users in both markets. We are on track to launch Omnipod 5 in additional countries starting in early 2025. We are also excited to expand our international offerings with additional sensor of choice, further launching Omnipod 5 integrated with FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and introducing the integration of G7 in the first half of 2025. Turning now to our customer base and market leadership. We continue to set the standard and be an industry leader with Omnipod 5. By the end of the third quarter, approximately 90% of our U.S. customers were already using Omnipod 5, as were approximately 25% of our international customers. This is a testament to the power of Omnipod 5. It wins everywhere it goes. Our strategy remains focused on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. MDI users are our target market and present a large opportunity as we continue to rapidly increase our customer base and drive overall market expansion. Our growth in the third quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI. As a result, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from people previously on MDI. We remain the clear market leader due to the highly differentiated nature of Omnipod. We have two decades of experience and investments that have led to our growing economies of scale. We have distinct and sustainable competitive advantages, including world-class manufacturing, which allows us to produce tens of millions of high-quality safety-critical pods. Adding to our scale, during the quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Malaysian manufacturing facility, which provides further flexibility and strengthens our capabilities. Additionally, widespread access through the U.S. pharmacy channel is an important value proposition for our customers. This was a multiyear journey requiring significant investments to build the specific expertise and deep infrastructure we have today. We are proud that our time and investments have paid off, with nearly 100% of our pods now sold through the pharmacy channel, with the number of HCPs writing scripts for Omnipod 5 growing to over 22,000. We are excited about where we sit today and the significant growth catalyst that we expect to drive further long-term value creation. With that, I will turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our global team continues to execute on our mission, and we delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 25% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimate global retention remained stable, and utilization was slightly higher than prior year. As Jim mentioned, we grew both global and U.S. new customer starts sequentially. Foreign currency had a favorable impact on total company reported revenue of 30 basis points versus our guide. U.S. Omnipod growth was 23%, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by ongoing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our U.S. revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by increased volume resulting from our success expanding our customer base. And the Omnipod 5 integration with G7 is quickly gaining momentum. We are excited about the opportunity that our Omnipod 5 type 2 label expansion brings to drive further growth in our business. We are seeing an uptick in type 2 new customer starts following the FDA clearance, which, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect to contribute meaningfully to revenue starting in 2025. Lastly, U.S. utilization trends were consistent with the prior year. Turning to International, where our team delivered another impressive quarter and once again sizably exceeded our expectations. In Q3, we drove growth in all of our international markets. We achieved International Omnipod revenue growth of 35%, primarily fueled by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5. Last year's launches in the U.K. and Germany are driving growth in revenue and new customer starts. And while still early days, we are seeing increased demand for Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands as well as for our recent integrations with Libre 2 Plus. While volume is the largest contributor to revenue growth, International revenue also benefited from higher pricing as new and existing customers adopt Omnipod 5. International utilization trends remained slightly elevated versus the prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw following the U.S. Omnipod 5 launch. We remain well positioned for further growth with more Omnipod 5 launches starting in early 2025. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable 130 basis points over the prior year and 230 basis points versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was $10 million, which was above our guidance range due to an increase in orders from our partner. Gross margin was 69.3%, up 150 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and our international markets as well as ongoing improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to drive margin expansion as we scale and execute on our initiatives to drive operational excellence across our business. Operating margin of 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA of 23.2% both exceeded our expectations, driven by our strong revenue and gross margin performances as well as the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. From a tax perspective, last quarter, we discussed the release of a portion of our valuation allowance. In the third quarter, we released an additional $12 million, resulting in a noncash tax benefit in the period, which has been adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We anticipate releasing the remaining balance of $15 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25% and for this to be the rate in 2025 as well. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $900 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Our commitment to drive margin expansion, profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying up, resulting in our ability to invest in our business and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our outlook, starting with our fourth quarter revenue. We expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 16% and total company growth of 12% to 15%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 9% to 12%. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we benefited from two stocking dynamics, totaling an estimated $30 million to $40 million. On a normalized basis, underlying growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 21% in the midpoint of the guidance range. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 30% to 33%. On a reported basis, we now assume a favorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect fourth quarter Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $7 million to $8 million. As a result of our fourth quarter revenue expectations, we now expect the following for the full year. We are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 21% to 22% and total company revenue growth to a range of 20% to 21%, putting us over $2 billion of total revenue for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and now expect growth of 19% to 21%. For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations to a range of 25% to 27%. On a reported basis, we now assume a 100 basis point tailwind from foreign currency. Our outlook for our International business is strengthened by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5, which has resulted in significant revenue outperformance and are raising International Omnipod full-year outlook by 1,700 basis points since the start of 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, our outlook has improved, and we now expect a smaller decline in the range of 5% to 10%. Turning to 2024 gross and operating margins. Given our strong performance to date and confidence in our outlook, we now expect gross margin to be approximately 69%. We also remain committed to driving further operating margin expansion as we continue to gain efficiencies across our organization and improve our operating leverage. Even as we continue to heavily invest for the long-term profitable growth. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14.5%. In closing, Insulet continues to be the market leader. Our expanding profitability and free cash flow drive our ability to continue to invest in our many growth catalysts. Our cascade of innovation and market expansion strengthen our long runway for sustainable profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a really nice third quarter. My one question. This quarter, Europe really stood out. Sizable beat, you said it was #1, new patient winner, and pricing helped. So I just wanted to help clarify a few things. Is that #1 in just the countries you're selling in? Or is that #1 overall in Europe? Which would be really impressive. How do we think about the magnitude of new patient growth? And if you want to throw U.S. in there as well, happy to hear that. And how do we think about the benefit of price and how sustainable is that? And how much more is to go in Europe? Thanks a lot.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the question, and thanks for your congrats. The #1 is in the markets we serve in Europe. So that's -- so we're #1 across. And the reason we think that's impressive is because, of course, we don't have Omnipod 5 yet in all the markets we serve. So in the countries where we're present internationally, Omnipod 5 is the #1 pump. And so we had a really strong quarter that way. The magnitude of the growth has been terrific. So U.K. and Germany continues strong. Netherlands and France are really just ramping, and we expect that to continue. So we're really pleased with the new customer starts growth in Europe. And you had a second question on the U.S. I'm going to turn to Ana, but maybe somebody can remind me what the second part of the U.S. was.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Yes. Maybe I'll touch on pricing in International. The way to think about it is markets where we've been present with Omnipod 5 a little bit longer, like the U.K. and Germany, are getting to that anniversary time period. So just to remind you, where we've launched Omnipod 5, we've gone to those health ministers -- ministries, and they have given us a premium for that because they see the value. And we anticipate that as we go to new markets -- by the way, France is early stages, but we'll be rolling out in another 10 markets as we move into 2025 here, we anticipate some countries will be going through their annual cycle, not having that bump in a year-over-year variance, but new ones are going to be ramping up. So bottom line is we anticipate to see price accretion in the international markets as we move into 2025. Maybe the other part of the question?\nRobert Marcus: It was just on magnitude of new patient growth.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. So new patient growth in Europe was stable in the quarter, which was terrific, because we would normally see some cyclicality, some seasonality in the summer months in Europe. So stable, really strong new customer starts with France, in particular, are just beginning to ramp. So we were pleased with that. And then in the U.S., we had really good new customer starts, clear and strong sequential growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 with -- leading the way with MDI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Look, I don't want to steal Larry's 2025 guidance question. So let me start with a higher-level question, if I could. Jim, over the past year or two, in the U.S., I think we've been adding probably four to five points of T1 penetration each year and maybe 0.5 point or a bit more T2. When I look at your business or maybe even more broadly, I guess, across the industry, when I think about manufacturers, when I think about payers, when I think about HCPs, is the bandwidth there that a T2 annual penetration moves to two or three points in a year or 2? Does four to five points of T1, two to three of T2, does that equal 6, 7 points of penetration each year for the market? Or is that going to be something less because one plus one isn't two because there's, I don't know, prior auth headwinds, there's capacity constraints on manufacturing front, doctors only have so much care time. Can the industry really handle kind of this potential uptick in T2 and keep the T1 penetration going at the same pace it's been going here in the last year or two? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Jeff. That's a great question. It's a little bit of a complicated question. So let me just answer it from our point of view and what we're doing. We continue to lead and extend type 1. We continue to drive MDI growth in type 1, where they're very clear leaders. So we intend to continue to be the leader and extend our lead in the type 1 market, which, of course, drives penetration because we're the player that's clearly leading in MDI and growing the market. On the type 2 side, we see that as an additive opportunity. The penetration in type 2 is very low for AID in type 2, and we saw a nice lift in September. So we feel really good about our position there as the first and only player with an indication for use in AID in the type 2 space. In terms of the penetration number, we can certainly grow both, and we will grow both. The type 2 will take some market development, but we're already seeing a lift. And we think, over the next handful of years, penetration can grow in type 2 2x or 3x over the span, maybe beyond. It's early days. And so we'll be leading and developing that market, and we'll continue to lead and develop both type 1 and type 2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for getting me back on. Not to steal Larry's thunder, but I know you're not going to guide on 2025 on this call, but I would like a higher level, like to think about kind of the opportunity you've got with new patient starts in 2025 with type 2. Just kind of all the puts and takes on '25 that you're thinking at this point. And one of your competitors talking about competitive dynamics, would love to hear how you're thinking about the competitive landscape as you move into '25 as well. Thank you.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Great. I'll start with the guidance and maybe Jim will jump in with some of these competitive dynamics. But we're really excited with our growth prospects and where we're here positioned as we're coming to an end here in the fourth quarter. We are -- as you indicated here, we're going to return to the industry standard of providing guidance as we get to the February marks of our annual cycles. And at that point, we'll be able to provide the best and most complete picture. But just to give you some color, and I'll start here with revenue, which is what drives our entire P&L here. You're very well aware of the cascade of innovations. Really, in the U.S., they really launched here in the second half. And that's where you've seen the sequential new customer starts uptake and those types of things. As you know, we're in the annuity model, so most of that revenue growth will come as we move into 2025. And then for the international markets, I started talking about some markets where we launched earlier, we'll go through that anniversary cycle and new ones will start ramping. So again, those are the key dynamics. I've touched already on a little bit of price in the international markets, where we're going to see greater strength in the U.S. We believe the majority of our growth will come from the base customer start that we're growing right now as we grow our NCS. So again, we feel very well positioned, and we'll provide you a lot more color as we move into February.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Ana. I'll just chime in on the competitive dynamic, Travis. We do have one competitor that comments a lot on the competitive dynamics in the market. And I'll just say, here's what we know. We have industry-leading retention that remains very high and stable. And with regard to that one kind of noisy competitor, we've actually, two quarters in a row now, seen an uptick of conversions coming from them on to Omnipod 5. So that's what we know. I would just remind -- and by the way, Omnipod 5 is so differentiated that we have continued to enjoy ever since launch competitive conversions coming on to the platform because patients find it easy to use. It has all the advantages we've talked about. But I'll just remind everybody that our focus is actually on driving growth in the market by focusing on bringing people who are on MDI, multiple daily injections, onto Omnipod 5 therapy. And we are the very clear leader in the MDI part of the market. In fact, I would -- ever since we launched Omnipod 5 in August of 2022, every quarter, we have added more patients coming off of MDI on to AID therapy with Omnipod 5 than all of our competitors combined, and that dynamic continues very clearly today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Polark: Good afternoon. Thank you. I have a question on type 2, the commercial preparation there, maybe it's a two-parter. One, on the field force investment, can you quantify kind of cumulatively, when you get through this cycle, how much you're expanding the rep base by? That's part 1. Part 2 then is on the doctors side. I heard, in the U.S., 22,000 HCPs are prescribing Omnipod 5. I'm curious for like type 2, do you have a sense for how many of those folks have ever written a DASH script? Kind of just interested what the share of wallet opportunity might be for type 2 versus just getting those HCPs to write type 2 for the first time. Thank you so much.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Mike. Great questions. I don't want to get into actually quantifying and say, headcount or spend. It's -- the spending is contemplated in our guide, in our margin guide. But what I -- let me try and answer your question this way, which is, what we're doing is we are extending our current commercial model into more accounts. And we've gotten a lot better during 2024 targeting according to opportunities. So you know that most of our call point, historically, has been with endocrinology practices. And what we're doing is taking our current commercial model into extending that into also high-writing PCP practices. And so maybe to put some scale in, I would say, we think, in our current call point, we reached roughly 30% or so of type 2 users who are on insulin-intensive MDI-type therapy. And as we extend into those high-writing practices, we get to north of 40% of those type 2 MDI insulin-using patients. Now we also will extend -- so our current call point treats some basal-only patients and that high-writing PCP has a higher mix of basal-only patients, and so we'll get to more of those patients as well. But that might give you a sense of the scale of the expansion here from reaching about 30% of those type 2 intensive users to about 40% of those type 2 users. And then just as a reminder, we've actually expanded the sales force. It's a very consistent thing for us to do to expand the sales force. So we've successfully done some expansion in '24, and now we're planning to extend the same very robust commercial model in Q4 and into '25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter here. Just a quick question. As we think about the Q4 guidance and how you're thinking about the U.S. Omnipod line item, specifically, it does come in at the midpoint below consensus, but you just beat the consensus number. So I just want to make sure we're considering everything in what is usually a seasonally stronger quarter from a deductible perspective and make sure I'm not missing anything there. Thanks so much.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Great. Thanks, Danielle, for your question. Absolutely correct. At the midpoint, our U.S. Omnipod guidance is below consensus, and it reflects -- I just want to remind everyone, it's a 21% growth on a normalized basis for the stocking activities that we saw a year ago. But at the high end of our guide, we are in line -- the consensus falls within that line. And it reflects actually that U.S. Omnipod will have grown more than 20% in each quarter of the 2024 calendar year. We see a lot of great traction and drivers. We see the trajectory, and we're really well positioned here. Our guidance really reflects our best available information at the moment, and that's what we're giving you all. So we are very excited and very well positioned to be at the midpoint of our full-year guidance range at the 20% mark for U.S. Omnipod.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPatrick Wood: Perfect. Thank you so much. Yes, just 1 from me, and apologies if you already hit this. We're all just juggling a lot of calls today. But the type 2 side of things, obviously, label cleared. You said that there was an improvement as you moved through the quarter. I'm just curious, initial feedback from patients. I know you've had some experience in that market already. But any learnings that surprised you that would have formed your thinking about what the ramp of that curve could look like as you move into next year? Just as you get your feet on the ground, how are you feeling it? And has there been anything that surprised you versus previous expectations? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Patrick, and thanks very much for the question. We did -- I would first -- I'll just say, I was so proud of our team because we didn't expect the label. We didn't expect the clearance until later in Q4, and we got it with a month to go in Q3. And so I was really proud of our team's ability to pull together and get everything done that we needed to get done to launch with clearance. And so that was terrific. And we did see a lift in September from MDI, the MDI patients that are coming from type 2. So it was a nice lift on the type 2 side. I think that what we've learned, both in the month of September, but also over the course of our Omnipod GO pilot, as we went into the practices and really tested that model out is that, first, there are just a lot of type 2 patients out there in the world who are on insulin therapy. They might be on a GLP-1, and they still struggle with glycemic control. They still have A1cs out of control. So there's a lot of demand there. And the SECURE-T2D trial showed really clearly that those patients can benefit the other thing we've learned is that those practices, maybe -- so I would say, high-writing PCP practices that maybe have not prescribed pumps historically, they really have a keen interest to understand AID technology. And they have an even keener interest once they see Omnipod because they have a preexisting conception that pumps are big, hard-to-use tubed things with cannulas and needles and so on. And when they see Omnipod, they see how simple it is. And we see that out in the market already as we promote, and we saw, interestingly, even with our investigators who took part in SECURE-T2D, that was one of the things that was really prominently mentioned by our investigation sites is how simple Omnipod 5 was for them and for many of them, how that was counter to their expectation. So those are pleasant surprises. And we're very, very bullish on continuing to develop that market and drive growth, given the need, the clinical need for people who are not controlled, even though they might be on insulin and maybe on a GLP-1 already, and given the interest that doctors are showing in the ease of use of Omnipod 5.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. And I guess, Jeff, is such a smart man. I do have a follow-up on the question Danielle asked earlier, but just a different angle here. So Jim, the Q4 underlying U.S. Omnipod growth, as you said, is about 21%, which does imply a deceleration from Q3 if we adjust for the stocking a year ago, I think, in Q3. So how should we think about the 21% underlying growth in the context of 2025? Does the type 2 launch help maintain or accelerate the U.S. Omnipod growth off of the Q4 underlying growth? Thank you.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Yes. I'll start with that one. So again, growth over 20%, we're excited by that. The thing to remember is a lot of these NCS sequential and growth we're experiencing also out of our type 2. Given our annuity model, we're going to see more of that benefit as we progress through the quarters here into 2025. So that would be the main driver here for our confidence and our excitement as we move forward. I don't know if there's...\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. I'll just add. As Ana said, we're -- our approach to this is to be very transparent with our best available estimates, and that's what we're giving you. We feel very confident in our guide. And if I go back to the new customer start dynamic, obviously, we had clear sequential new customer start growth in the U.S. At least, by the way, we would have had even without the lift in type 2. So we had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 1. We had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 2. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have -- and we said this last quarter. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have year-over-year growth for the second half in the U.S. So the dynamic is really clear. We're confident in our guide. The type 2 growth gives us even more confidence in our guide for Q4. But as you all know, with our annuity model, that revenue ramps into '25 will create a ramping effect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's actually Jimmy on for Margaret tonight. I wanted to touch on operating margins. Really, really strong performance here this quarter. So maybe you can just talk to some of the points that are driving that leverage? And then as it relates to your confidence on sustaining that into next year?\nAna Maria Chadwick: Thank you, Jimmy, for that. Great. No, we are very -- we have had delivered very strong margin growth, and we feel very strongly that we will continue. And as I've said before, we're benchmarking here to at least 100 basis points annually of that margin expansion. That's what we've said before, and we continue to believe that. Some of the key components of that margin, as you can tell here, came from the gross margin expansion we have had. In addition, the scale that we have has allowed us to get some leverage in the operating -- in the base operating expenses as well. So as we continue to grow, we anticipate growth in gross margin, and I have also mentioned this before. In gross margin, we anticipate the growth to be more moderate as we move forward. And the reason for that is we have benefited significantly in the U.S. from price appreciation as we have moved out of the DME into the pharmacy channel. And now, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really at 100% of our volume roughly coming in through the pharmacy channel. So that lift will be there going forward, but we have many other levers around efficiencies, around how we have the volumes come from Malaysia and a lot of other things. And in the international markets, we do anticipate some price accretion. So just to wrap it up here, we have benefits coming in from gross margin. And in addition to that, we have the leverage of our scale as we leverage our operating expenses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Issie Kirby from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nIssie Kirby: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the basal side of things. Obviously, you had a bit of a change in your strategy as flagged last quarter there. So just wanted to hear about what you're seeing from patients and providers on the basal side. Any sign that you're seeing patients who are on basal perhaps intensifying and moving on to Omnipod now that it's more available to them? And just on type 2 more broadly, I guess, any early learnings around retention and behavior for these patients?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Issie, for those questions. Let me start with the basal side. We already -- we know we already have a number of physicians out in the market who have been writing Omnipod 5 for basal-only patients off-label before we got the indication for use. And Omnipod 5 is just so simple to use and is very, very well suited to those patients for a number of reasons. And we will obviously promote to those patients. The SECURE-T2D data showed really clearly that basal-only patients benefited. That population -- that study population had about 20% of the patients in it who are basal-only patients, and they have the same benefit as patients on -- that were on multiple daily injections. And so we know it's a huge benefit to them. And the question is, who's out there that's on insulin therapy that's not controlled? That's really the target market, and that would be both intensive users and basal users. And as we extend our reach into those high-writing PCP practices, we'll find more and more of those patients. So we're bullish on both sides of the type 2 market. On retention, that's a really good question. Our customer base does include a portion of type 2 patients. Our retention has remained strong. It's mostly type 1, but our retention has remained very strong. We do anticipate over time that what we'll see is that type 2 patients, they have a lot going on in their lives. They have a lot of comorbidities. I think we'll see different subsegments of type 2 patients. And so in different parts of the type 2 population, I think it's quite likely that we'll see different usage patterns and maybe some lower retention in parts of the type 2 population. But all of those patients are incremental to our business, first, I would say. So it's all additional volume and additional patient growth for us. And over time, we'll be building more and more customized offerings for type 2 patients, which is something we'll be doing over the next few months, several quarters. And really work with the type 2 patients to make their experience on Omnipod 5 just as simple as possible so we can give them the same kind of market-leading retention on therapy and experience of therapy that we've given all of our patients historically.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Kratky from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMike Kratky: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide some additional color on how much of a commercial impact you've seen, either positive or negative from some of the CGM integrations that have transpired this year, both within your own products or competitors getting a bit of a head start? How meaningful of an impact would you say these integrations are having on new starts or your existing customer base or any commercial dynamics?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Mike. I'll start with that, and I don't know if Ana will want to add some commentary. Our sensor integrations have been terrific for us and for our patients. So in the middle of the year, in the U.S., we've launched our G7 integration. G7, obviously, very highly prescribed sensor in the U.S. market. We were really successful with that through specialty pharmacy and, obviously, are now fully in retail with the G7. And that's been a really material part of our new customer starts. We still start a lot of G6 patients as well in the U.S. market. So providing Choice of Sensors has been a big boon to our patients and for us and our new customer start growth. In Europe, obviously, we've launched in Europe initially with the G6 integration. And then we most recently launched a Sensor of Choice integration in the U.K. and the Netherlands. And so in those markets, the customer has a choice between the G6 sensor and the Libre 2 Plus Sensor. Those markets are both growing really well. And both of those -- both the Libre and the G6 integrations have done very well for us. And we're very excited, as we said in our prepared remarks, to be bringing the Libre 2 Plus Sensor integration by the end of the year to the U.S. So we'll have three sensors available to customers in the U.S. And every time we've launched a new sensor integration, it's been -- it provides more choice to our customers, which is obviously a benefit to them, but it's also given us tailwinds of growth.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Maybe I'll just add a perspective with our most recent iOS launch here with -- it applies right now in the U.S. with the G6. But I mean the success that we're seeing with the amount of downloads to speed, how our customers are responding to it and everything, gives us even that greater confidence that we will continue in that path to have more of those available through iOS in the future. So I just wanted to add that commentary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Apologize to the background noise. So I have a clarification and a question. Just a clarification on the international strength. You mentioned the slight uptick in utilization. To be clear, there was no stocking benefit to quantify. This is just a natural occurrence when you launch Omnipod 5. That's the clarification. The question is, just on your user base in the context of pricing, if 90% of the U.S. users are on Omnipod 5, 25% in Europe, how high can your European base go in terms of Omnipod 5 adoption?\nAna Maria Chadwick: Great. I'll take the first part here. In terms of our international strength and the utilization uptick, we view that nothing to do with stocking. This is entirely to do with when you launch the new product, similar to what we saw in the U.S., probably at a little smaller degree, but people just get maybe a couple of two orders at once just to get some backups for their usage later. So we're seeing some of that similar dynamic in the international markets where we've launched.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Jayson. I'll just -- on how high the usage of Omnipod 5 can go in our international markets, I would expect to see a very similar dynamic in international markets as we've seen in the U.S. market, which is Omnipod 5 becomes the AID of choice, including in our own customer base. And so over time, as we bring Omnipod 5 across our international markets, I think it will be, by far, the predominant used products in our portfolio. But it will -- there's a little care -- we've talked about this before. In Europe, people are on contracts. And so even converting from -- in most markets, even converting from DASH on to Omnipod 5, we'll wait for the contract period to come up. It's usually a four year reimbursement cycle for them. And so we won't see it move as quickly. But over time, we'll see Omnipod 5 is -- as our clearly leading offer in our portfolio in our international markets. And as we said, Omnipod 5 already, just with the markets we've launched in Europe, is the number one pump in Europe in the markets we serve. And so you can see the power of it. We expect to see really strong new customer starts as well as we get Omnipod 5 rolled out internationally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-up on the type 2. It's very exciting stuff. Your competitors put out some estimates with market research that they think the market could get to 25% penetration in a three to five year time frame for intensive type 2 in the U.S. And I guess, I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that? Do you agree with that number directionally? Do you think that's in the ballpark? Have you done any research to confirm that?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. It's a great question. We're very bullish on type 2. We have such a great opportunity with type 2. And we're the first to market with AID. And we're the first to market an only AID in the market, with the products that overtook all of the AID players in the type 1 market. And if anything, I have -- I think we have a clear right to win in the type 2 market because Omnipod 5 has all of the benefits. It's so easy use, easy to set up, available in pharmacy where patients get their insulin, easy access, pay as you go, all the things we talk about all the time. So I think we have a very, very clear right to win the type 2 space. The SECURE-T2D data is really remarkable. And so we're very bullish on it. I think we said earlier in Q&A that over the next handful of years, we think penetration could double or triple in the type 2 space. We'll be the player that does that. It's very clear that we're developing the market. We're the ones who lead the market right now. We're number one in the market right now. And we're very optimistic about growth in the space. It's early days. We'll see where we can take it, but we think there's a big growth for us over the next few years in type 2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Would love to talk about the pharmacy channel a little bit. You've had a competitor on the durable side in that space over the last few quarters. And then yesterday, your noisy competitor also mentioned that they just got their first contract signed. So can you just talk about your ability to defend your position in that channel? And then more specifically, on the pricing side, to make sure, because I know they're going to push on the pricing side once they get bigger and bigger there. How do you defend your pricing within the pharmacy channel? Thank you.\nJim Hollingshead: Great question. Thank you. I'll just start by saying that we have a very strong position in the pharmacy channel. And the reason we do is because Omnipod fits the pharmacy channel so well. First is the product, the consumable is the pump. It comes in a box. You get it at the same place you get your insulin. And we have Part D reimbursement, which is the pharmacy benefit reimbursement. So the product is the channel. And it meets the needs of all the stakeholders in the channel. So it's very easy for patients to use. It's very easy for physicians to write because it's full pharmacy reimbursement. They can write a prescription. Often, they can write a prescription in a down -- in sort of a drop-down venue so that they can just send it to the local pharmacy. It's great for payers because we have very high member satisfaction for payers who -- for patients who go on Omnipod 5. And it's great for PBMs because we do so much volume through the channel that our PBM partners get a lot of revenue off of our rebate money. And so it's a great business system for us and for all of our stakeholders, and we're very strongly positioned. As far as price goes, those are negotiations. We negotiate our PBM contracts every year. We're very used to it. There's a win-win there for volume against rebates for us. We have great relationships. And this is a capability we've built up over several years, relationships and contracts. We have many, many contracts with PBMs in the industry. And just as a reminder to everybody, we signed our first PBM contract in 2016 -- sorry, no, let me correct that. We started the process and negotiations in 2016. We signed our first contract in 2017. So we've had contracts with PBMs now for more than seven years. We have a lot of experience in this space, and we're very confident in our ability to defend our position.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Can you guys have mentioned some of the work you're doing on fully closed-loop algorithms. It seems like, broadly, there's a push across the industry right now to develop offerings that would do a better job helping those patients who aren't quite as actively engaged with managing their own disease. Could you give us an update on where your work on that front stands? How you're thinking about it? Is this a solution for a narrow segment of users or something that has broader applicability? And then how close are you to having something that could be ready for commercial use?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Chris. As you know, we've talked publicly, we talked at ADA about two separate and parallel algorithm development programs. But let me just start by saying something about our current algorithm. The Omnipod 5 algorithm is a great algorithm. It produces fantastic results. You can see from our real-world evidence, which includes all of our users, in effect, that we see all corners of usage, we have industry-leading time and range with very low hypoglycemia. And so our current algorithm also responds really well to missed boluses. So when Omnipod 5 senses a missed bolus, it will deliver a significant percentage of total daily insulin to bring the patient back into range. So our current algorithm performs really, really well at a population level and for all the individuals using it. Now having said that, we have two programs working on different areas with different concepts. One of which, I would say, is closer to a fully closed-loop algorithm. But two, both of them have been accelerated because of all the evidence we get off of actual patient usage. So even after the first 30,000 patients on Omnipod, which was quarters ago, we were able to see patterns of usage that allowed us to do in silica simulations. So we use our data sciences and big data capabilities to simulate adjustments to the algorithm, and that's what's allowed us to get into early clinical trials with two different algorithm programs that we've shared some of that data over the course of the last year. So we see real opportunity to drive improved algorithms and with a couple of different approaches, and we're happy to be able to accelerate that program. But we also know we're delivering great glycemic control and outcomes in the market right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much for taking the question. I'm curious with just about a couple of things. Where to start? I think I'm just going to start with the impact of integrating Libre and G7. I mean does that create sort of a step-up opportunity for you in terms of new patients? And can you confirm, did you have positive new patient starts this quarter? Or is that more of a fourth quarter event year-over-year? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Joanne. We -- yes, the integrations with the sensors help us. They give us tailwinds. G7 has been an obvious tailwind for us in the U.S. with our new customer starts. And then the Libre 2 Plus launches have been tailwinds for us in the U.K. and in the Netherlands. So those are positive for us. And as we bring the Libre 2 Plus integration to the U.S., we think that will create another growth tailwind opportunity for us. And then in terms of growth, we have really clear sequential growth in new customer starts in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2. MDI grew for both type 1 and type 2. And we expect to see, as we promised last quarter, we've said all year, we would have sequential growth every year. We delivered that in Q3. In Q4, in the U.S., we will see sequential growth that will also be year-over-year growth in new customer starts and, collectively, Q3 and Q4 in the U.S., we expect very clearly to have year-over-year growth for the second half based upon that dynamic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to -- you mentioned the retention rate and, obviously, leading in new patients starts. I think, Jim, you talked about overtaking the other players in the space with this -- with your pump format. Can you talk a little bit about how you measure retention? And how, if at all, investors can kind of get a sense of how that's trending, if it's just rock solid in the mid to upper 90s or if it moves around a bunch? Any color would be appreciated. Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Matt. First, let me start with the data. The vast majority of our users in the U.S. market are on Omnipod 5. So that's cloud data. So it's very high fidelity. We can tell when somebody has started. We can tell when somebody has stopped. So we have really clear data on this. Our retention remains really high. And so it runs in the, I'm going to say, the low 90s. I will look around the room and make sure that's right. So it runs in low 90s, and it's very stable. It really doesn't move very much period-over-period. It's a very, very stable thing. We're very focused on creating and delivering an experience with our customers that makes it really easy for them to stay on, and we're going to build and continue to build capabilities in that area. But that's to give you a sense of it. It's very stable. It's very high. Very predictable.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBill Plovanic: Yes, great. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just shift gears. I mean if you've been launching the AID system and just trying to understand the impact you've seen on the commercial organization. I know you're scaling up to maybe go after different customer channels. But what has been the impact on the service to the patients? And has this been lessening? With the thought of potentially has this been lessening over time, where you're focused kind of more on selling than -- and less on kind of servicing the patient on an ongoing basis? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Bill. That's a great question. Actually, we're really focused on building a completely differentiated end-to-end customer experience. In fact, the way we talk about this internally is that's actually what we deliver to people. We deliver an end-to-end customer experience that starts with the moment they might be diagnosed or they might be -- their child might be diagnosed, all the way out to pods for life. And we have, I think, a unique opportunity and a unique capability to do that because of the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5. And so I think our customer service, our customer care, our product support are all really world-class. What -- I'll just say that when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S. in August of 2022, you all might remember, that actually, we had so much demand that, for a period of time there, we had trouble answering the phones. And so there was -- when we started, there was so much demand that we had not really appropriately scaled to support our customers as they got on product and they got trained. Those days are behind us. We've got -- we've scaled our commercial capabilities. We've scaled our customer care. We've scaled our inside sales. We've scaled our product support. And we're laser-focused on building the best end-to-end customer experience for users of Omnipod now and in the future over time. We're really excited about our unique opportunity to do that.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you all for joining us today. We have strong sustainable competitive advantages that allow us to deliver market-leading technology, market-leading growth and a strong financial foundation that positions us to continue to drive long-term value creation. Our type 2 label expansion is a game-changer and another major milestone for all stakeholders, including investors, employees, HCPs and most importantly, our customers. I'm proud of the work our team is doing to disrupt the diabetes market and improve the lives of people with diabetes. We have a clear strategy to expand the Omnipod 5 platform, drive growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 and accelerate international growth and expansion. We continue to make significant progress in each of these areas and have strong momentum across our organization. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication, passion, and deep commitment to further our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and achieved several outstanding milestones throughout our business. I am proud of what our team accomplishes every day to create better health outcomes for our customers, set new standards in the management of diabetes and drive success across our organization. The robust momentum we saw in the first half of this year has carried into the back half, putting us on track to close out another impressive year and generate over $2 billion in full year revenue for the first time in Insulet's history. Near the end of August, we received FDA clearance for type 2 label expansion for Omnipod 5, which is a testament to the strength of our submission and powerful clinical data. We are excited about our opportunity in the type 2 diabetes market and building upon our strong established foundation for long-term growth. In the third quarter, our global new customer starts grew sequentially and over prior year. This included sequential growth in the U.S. in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. Internationally, our strong momentum also continued with stable sequential new customer starts, proof of the robust demand we are seeing for Omnipod 5, considering the typical seasonality that occurs during the slower summer months in our international markets. Omnipod 5 is winning in every market in which it is offered, and Omnipod is now the #1 insulin pump for new pump users in Europe. We remain confident in our expectation of sequential and year-over-year new customer starts growth for both the U.S. and International in the fourth quarter. We have a clear strategy focused on expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, driving growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and the type 2 and accelerating international growth and expansion. Our recent milestones are key indicators of the progress we continue to make and the momentum across our organization to achieve our strategic goals. And this momentum is reflected in our strong financial results. In Q3, we achieved our highest quarter of total revenue dollars, driven by total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 23% and International growth of 35%. And we continue to expand margins as we scale, execute and drive efficiencies across our global business. Ana will take you through the financial details for the quarter and provide an update on guidance. I will focus my remarks on three key areas: first, our type 2 label expansion, the market opportunity and our commercialization plans; second, our cascade of innovation and how it supports our strategy to drive growth in both the U.S. and internationally; and third, our customer base and market leadership. Let me start with our recent type 2 label expansion, which makes Omnipod 5 the first and only AID system indicated for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be. And now we are bringing all the benefits to individuals with type 2 diabetes that we already deliver to those with type 1, namely: unmatched form factor, ease of use, affordability, pay-as-you-go economics and widespread access through the pharmacy channel. All of this, together with CGM integration and compatibility with Android- and iOS-based smartphones and, most importantly, all while delivering great clinical outcomes and quality of life. Omnipod 5's type 2 label expansion further strengthens our growth trajectory. In fact, type 2 users represented over 25% of our U.S. new customer starts in the third quarter as we drove ramping adoption during September. In the U.S., our type 2 indication significantly expands the total addressable market for Insulet by making Omnipod 5 commercially available to approximately 6 million people who live with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes. This market includes 2.5 million people who are insulin intensive and on multiple daily injections. We estimate that market is less than 5% penetrated, with the majority of current users using Omnipod. The other portion of the market includes over 3 million people that use insulin as a basal-only therapy every day. In order to continue expanding our reach to type 2 patients, we are well underway on an initiative to expand our sales force and commercial relationships to align with the immense opportunity at hand. We have begun the process of growing our team in anticipation of type 2 clearance earlier this year, and we continue to expand today. This strategy is consistent with our established U.S. commercial playbook, adding feet on the street to build on our existing relationships with endocrinology practices while also broadening our reach into high-prescribing PCP practices. With this expansion, we expect to reach over 40% of the 2.5 million type 2 insulin-intensive population during 2025. And we will also be able to go deeper into PCP practices, where we are already receiving great inbound interest. Additionally, we continue to complement our direct selling model with DTC. We expect our type 2 label expansion will make our DTC efforts and awareness initiatives even more efficient. Historically, over 50% of our DTC leads are from individuals with type 2 diabetes, and now we can get those customers quickly onto Omnipod 5. We are making all of these investments thoughtfully. And as our Q3 results demonstrate, we are committed to driving further margin expansion. Let me now discuss our cascade of innovation and how we continue to strengthen our market-leading position as we expand our Omnipod 5 platform. Last quarter, we announced the full market release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the U.S., starting with specialty pharmacies, and communicated that we would ramp G7-compatible pods broadly through retail pharmacy channels over the following months. This approach has proven to be very effective, and G7 customer starts have consistently met our targets. I'm happy to announce that G7 pods are now fully available in retail pharmacies, in addition to customers also having the choice of specialty pharmacy, making it even easier to start on Omnipod 5. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the U.S., we are on track to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of the year. We are excited to provide customers' expanding options as we have experienced great success in providing [indiscernible] with the Choice of Sensors in the U.K. and the Netherlands with both Abbott and Dexcom CGM offerings. At the start of last week, we fully launched the Omnipod 5 iOS app in the U.S., in line with our planned timing. Within hours of our app launch, we became the top downloaded medical app in the iOS App Store. Integrated with G6, our app offers enhanced capabilities that are unique and huge timesavers for Podders, such as a custom foods feature that makes mealtime simpler. Early feedback has been extremely positive. We heard from one of our customers who told us, \"Being able to do daily activities and need to carry only my personal smartphone is the smallest piece of normalcy and the biggest relief. I'm sitting here crying just overwhelmed with how much that means. I haven't felt this normal in years, and it means so much.\" The iOS app is just 1 more advancement that allows our customers to enjoy simplicity, freedom and healthier lives through our innovative technology. And as previously communicated, we remain on track to launch the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G7 in the U.S. and are planning to bring this integration to market in the first half of 2025. Internationally, we are making great progress with our recent launches of Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands and, although early, Omnipod 5 is starting to build a growing number of new users in both markets. We are on track to launch Omnipod 5 in additional countries starting in early 2025. We are also excited to expand our international offerings with additional sensor of choice, further launching Omnipod 5 integrated with FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and introducing the integration of G7 in the first half of 2025. Turning now to our customer base and market leadership. We continue to set the standard and be an industry leader with Omnipod 5. By the end of the third quarter, approximately 90% of our U.S. customers were already using Omnipod 5, as were approximately 25% of our international customers. This is a testament to the power of Omnipod 5. It wins everywhere it goes. Our strategy remains focused on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. MDI users are our target market and present a large opportunity as we continue to rapidly increase our customer base and drive overall market expansion. Our growth in the third quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI. As a result, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from people previously on MDI. We remain the clear market leader due to the highly differentiated nature of Omnipod. We have two decades of experience and investments that have led to our growing economies of scale. We have distinct and sustainable competitive advantages, including world-class manufacturing, which allows us to produce tens of millions of high-quality safety-critical pods. Adding to our scale, during the quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Malaysian manufacturing facility, which provides further flexibility and strengthens our capabilities. Additionally, widespread access through the U.S. pharmacy channel is an important value proposition for our customers. This was a multiyear journey requiring significant investments to build the specific expertise and deep infrastructure we have today. We are proud that our time and investments have paid off, with nearly 100% of our pods now sold through the pharmacy channel, with the number of HCPs writing scripts for Omnipod 5 growing to over 22,000. We are excited about where we sit today and the significant growth catalyst that we expect to drive further long-term value creation. With that, I will turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance. Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the question, and thanks for your congrats. The #1 is in the markets we serve in Europe. So that's -- so we're #1 across. And the reason we think that's impressive is because, of course, we don't have Omnipod 5 yet in all the markets we serve. So in the countries where we're present internationally, Omnipod 5 is the #1 pump. And so we had a really strong quarter that way. The magnitude of the growth has been terrific. So U.K. and Germany continues strong. Netherlands and France are really just ramping, and we expect that to continue. So we're really pleased with the new customer starts growth in Europe. And you had a second question on the U.S. I'm going to turn to Ana, but maybe somebody can remind me what the second part of the U.S. was. Yes. So new patient growth in Europe was stable in the quarter, which was terrific, because we would normally see some cyclicality, some seasonality in the summer months in Europe. So stable, really strong new customer starts with France, in particular, are just beginning to ramp. So we were pleased with that. And then in the U.S., we had really good new customer starts, clear and strong sequential growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 with -- leading the way with MDI. Thanks, Jeff. That's a great question. It's a little bit of a complicated question. So let me just answer it from our point of view and what we're doing. We continue to lead and extend type 1. We continue to drive MDI growth in type 1, where they're very clear leaders. So we intend to continue to be the leader and extend our lead in the type 1 market, which, of course, drives penetration because we're the player that's clearly leading in MDI and growing the market. On the type 2 side, we see that as an additive opportunity. The penetration in type 2 is very low for AID in type 2, and we saw a nice lift in September. So we feel really good about our position there as the first and only player with an indication for use in AID in the type 2 space. In terms of the penetration number, we can certainly grow both, and we will grow both. The type 2 will take some market development, but we're already seeing a lift. And we think, over the next handful of years, penetration can grow in type 2 2x or 3x over the span, maybe beyond. It's early days. And so we'll be leading and developing that market, and we'll continue to lead and develop both type 1 and type 2. Yes. Thanks, Ana. I'll just chime in on the competitive dynamic, Travis. We do have one competitor that comments a lot on the competitive dynamics in the market. And I'll just say, here's what we know. We have industry-leading retention that remains very high and stable. And with regard to that one kind of noisy competitor, we've actually, two quarters in a row now, seen an uptick of conversions coming from them on to Omnipod 5. So that's what we know. I would just remind -- and by the way, Omnipod 5 is so differentiated that we have continued to enjoy ever since launch competitive conversions coming on to the platform because patients find it easy to use. It has all the advantages we've talked about. But I'll just remind everybody that our focus is actually on driving growth in the market by focusing on bringing people who are on MDI, multiple daily injections, onto Omnipod 5 therapy. And we are the very clear leader in the MDI part of the market. In fact, I would -- ever since we launched Omnipod 5 in August of 2022, every quarter, we have added more patients coming off of MDI on to AID therapy with Omnipod 5 than all of our competitors combined, and that dynamic continues very clearly today. Thanks, Mike. Great questions. I don't want to get into actually quantifying and say, headcount or spend. It's -- the spending is contemplated in our guide, in our margin guide. But what I -- let me try and answer your question this way, which is, what we're doing is we are extending our current commercial model into more accounts. And we've gotten a lot better during 2024 targeting according to opportunities. So you know that most of our call point, historically, has been with endocrinology practices. And what we're doing is taking our current commercial model into extending that into also high-writing PCP practices. And so maybe to put some scale in, I would say, we think, in our current call point, we reached roughly 30% or so of type 2 users who are on insulin-intensive MDI-type therapy. And as we extend into those high-writing practices, we get to north of 40% of those type 2 MDI insulin-using patients. Now we also will extend -- so our current call point treats some basal-only patients and that high-writing PCP has a higher mix of basal-only patients, and so we'll get to more of those patients as well. But that might give you a sense of the scale of the expansion here from reaching about 30% of those type 2 intensive users to about 40% of those type 2 users. And then just as a reminder, we've actually expanded the sales force. It's a very consistent thing for us to do to expand the sales force. So we've successfully done some expansion in '24, and now we're planning to extend the same very robust commercial model in Q4 and into '25. Thanks, Patrick, and thanks very much for the question. We did -- I would first -- I'll just say, I was so proud of our team because we didn't expect the label. We didn't expect the clearance until later in Q4, and we got it with a month to go in Q3. And so I was really proud of our team's ability to pull together and get everything done that we needed to get done to launch with clearance. And so that was terrific. And we did see a lift in September from MDI, the MDI patients that are coming from type 2. So it was a nice lift on the type 2 side. I think that what we've learned, both in the month of September, but also over the course of our Omnipod GO pilot, as we went into the practices and really tested that model out is that, first, there are just a lot of type 2 patients out there in the world who are on insulin therapy. They might be on a GLP-1, and they still struggle with glycemic control. They still have A1cs out of control. So there's a lot of demand there. And the SECURE-T2D trial showed really clearly that those patients can benefit the other thing we've learned is that those practices, maybe -- so I would say, high-writing PCP practices that maybe have not prescribed pumps historically, they really have a keen interest to understand AID technology. And they have an even keener interest once they see Omnipod because they have a preexisting conception that pumps are big, hard-to-use tubed things with cannulas and needles and so on. And when they see Omnipod, they see how simple it is. And we see that out in the market already as we promote, and we saw, interestingly, even with our investigators who took part in SECURE-T2D, that was one of the things that was really prominently mentioned by our investigation sites is how simple Omnipod 5 was for them and for many of them, how that was counter to their expectation. So those are pleasant surprises. And we're very, very bullish on continuing to develop that market and drive growth, given the need, the clinical need for people who are not controlled, even though they might be on insulin and maybe on a GLP-1 already, and given the interest that doctors are showing in the ease of use of Omnipod 5. Yes. I'll just add. As Ana said, we're -- our approach to this is to be very transparent with our best available estimates, and that's what we're giving you. We feel very confident in our guide. And if I go back to the new customer start dynamic, obviously, we had clear sequential new customer start growth in the U.S. At least, by the way, we would have had even without the lift in type 2. So we had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 1. We had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 2. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have -- and we said this last quarter. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have year-over-year growth for the second half in the U.S. So the dynamic is really clear. We're confident in our guide. The type 2 growth gives us even more confidence in our guide for Q4. But as you all know, with our annuity model, that revenue ramps into '25 will create a ramping effect. Thanks, Issie, for those questions. Let me start with the basal side. We already -- we know we already have a number of physicians out in the market who have been writing Omnipod 5 for basal-only patients off-label before we got the indication for use. And Omnipod 5 is just so simple to use and is very, very well suited to those patients for a number of reasons. And we will obviously promote to those patients. The SECURE-T2D data showed really clearly that basal-only patients benefited. That population -- that study population had about 20% of the patients in it who are basal-only patients, and they have the same benefit as patients on -- that were on multiple daily injections. And so we know it's a huge benefit to them. And the question is, who's out there that's on insulin therapy that's not controlled? That's really the target market, and that would be both intensive users and basal users. And as we extend our reach into those high-writing PCP practices, we'll find more and more of those patients. So we're bullish on both sides of the type 2 market. On retention, that's a really good question. Our customer base does include a portion of type 2 patients. Our retention has remained strong. It's mostly type 1, but our retention has remained very strong. We do anticipate over time that what we'll see is that type 2 patients, they have a lot going on in their lives. They have a lot of comorbidities. I think we'll see different subsegments of type 2 patients. And so in different parts of the type 2 population, I think it's quite likely that we'll see different usage patterns and maybe some lower retention in parts of the type 2 population. But all of those patients are incremental to our business, first, I would say. So it's all additional volume and additional patient growth for us. And over time, we'll be building more and more customized offerings for type 2 patients, which is something we'll be doing over the next few months, several quarters. And really work with the type 2 patients to make their experience on Omnipod 5 just as simple as possible so we can give them the same kind of market-leading retention on therapy and experience of therapy that we've given all of our patients historically. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with that, and I don't know if Ana will want to add some commentary. Our sensor integrations have been terrific for us and for our patients. So in the middle of the year, in the U.S., we've launched our G7 integration. G7, obviously, very highly prescribed sensor in the U.S. market. We were really successful with that through specialty pharmacy and, obviously, are now fully in retail with the G7. And that's been a really material part of our new customer starts. We still start a lot of G6 patients as well in the U.S. market. So providing Choice of Sensors has been a big boon to our patients and for us and our new customer start growth. In Europe, obviously, we've launched in Europe initially with the G6 integration. And then we most recently launched a Sensor of Choice integration in the U.K. and the Netherlands. And so in those markets, the customer has a choice between the G6 sensor and the Libre 2 Plus Sensor. Those markets are both growing really well. And both of those -- both the Libre and the G6 integrations have done very well for us. And we're very excited, as we said in our prepared remarks, to be bringing the Libre 2 Plus Sensor integration by the end of the year to the U.S. So we'll have three sensors available to customers in the U.S. And every time we've launched a new sensor integration, it's been -- it provides more choice to our customers, which is obviously a benefit to them, but it's also given us tailwinds of growth. Yes. Thanks, Jayson. I'll just -- on how high the usage of Omnipod 5 can go in our international markets, I would expect to see a very similar dynamic in international markets as we've seen in the U.S. market, which is Omnipod 5 becomes the AID of choice, including in our own customer base. And so over time, as we bring Omnipod 5 across our international markets, I think it will be, by far, the predominant used products in our portfolio. But it will -- there's a little care -- we've talked about this before. In Europe, people are on contracts. And so even converting from -- in most markets, even converting from DASH on to Omnipod 5, we'll wait for the contract period to come up. It's usually a four year reimbursement cycle for them. And so we won't see it move as quickly. But over time, we'll see Omnipod 5 is -- as our clearly leading offer in our portfolio in our international markets. And as we said, Omnipod 5 already, just with the markets we've launched in Europe, is the number one pump in Europe in the markets we serve. And so you can see the power of it. We expect to see really strong new customer starts as well as we get Omnipod 5 rolled out internationally. Thanks, Matt. It's a great question. We're very bullish on type 2. We have such a great opportunity with type 2. And we're the first to market with AID. And we're the first to market an only AID in the market, with the products that overtook all of the AID players in the type 1 market. And if anything, I have -- I think we have a clear right to win in the type 2 market because Omnipod 5 has all of the benefits. It's so easy use, easy to set up, available in pharmacy where patients get their insulin, easy access, pay as you go, all the things we talk about all the time. So I think we have a very, very clear right to win the type 2 space. The SECURE-T2D data is really remarkable. And so we're very bullish on it. I think we said earlier in Q&A that over the next handful of years, we think penetration could double or triple in the type 2 space. We'll be the player that does that. It's very clear that we're developing the market. We're the ones who lead the market right now. We're number one in the market right now. And we're very optimistic about growth in the space. It's early days. We'll see where we can take it, but we think there's a big growth for us over the next few years in type 2. Great question. Thank you. I'll just start by saying that we have a very strong position in the pharmacy channel. And the reason we do is because Omnipod fits the pharmacy channel so well. First is the product, the consumable is the pump. It comes in a box. You get it at the same place you get your insulin. And we have Part D reimbursement, which is the pharmacy benefit reimbursement. So the product is the channel. And it meets the needs of all the stakeholders in the channel. So it's very easy for patients to use. It's very easy for physicians to write because it's full pharmacy reimbursement. They can write a prescription. Often, they can write a prescription in a down -- in sort of a drop-down venue so that they can just send it to the local pharmacy. It's great for payers because we have very high member satisfaction for payers who -- for patients who go on Omnipod 5. And it's great for PBMs because we do so much volume through the channel that our PBM partners get a lot of revenue off of our rebate money. And so it's a great business system for us and for all of our stakeholders, and we're very strongly positioned. As far as price goes, those are negotiations. We negotiate our PBM contracts every year. We're very used to it. There's a win-win there for volume against rebates for us. We have great relationships. And this is a capability we've built up over several years, relationships and contracts. We have many, many contracts with PBMs in the industry. And just as a reminder to everybody, we signed our first PBM contract in 2016 -- sorry, no, let me correct that. We started the process and negotiations in 2016. We signed our first contract in 2017. So we've had contracts with PBMs now for more than seven years. We have a lot of experience in this space, and we're very confident in our ability to defend our position. Yes. Thanks, Chris. As you know, we've talked publicly, we talked at ADA about two separate and parallel algorithm development programs. But let me just start by saying something about our current algorithm. The Omnipod 5 algorithm is a great algorithm. It produces fantastic results. You can see from our real-world evidence, which includes all of our users, in effect, that we see all corners of usage, we have industry-leading time and range with very low hypoglycemia. And so our current algorithm also responds really well to missed boluses. So when Omnipod 5 senses a missed bolus, it will deliver a significant percentage of total daily insulin to bring the patient back into range. So our current algorithm performs really, really well at a population level and for all the individuals using it. Now having said that, we have two programs working on different areas with different concepts. One of which, I would say, is closer to a fully closed-loop algorithm. But two, both of them have been accelerated because of all the evidence we get off of actual patient usage. So even after the first 30,000 patients on Omnipod, which was quarters ago, we were able to see patterns of usage that allowed us to do in silica simulations. So we use our data sciences and big data capabilities to simulate adjustments to the algorithm, and that's what's allowed us to get into early clinical trials with two different algorithm programs that we've shared some of that data over the course of the last year. So we see real opportunity to drive improved algorithms and with a couple of different approaches, and we're happy to be able to accelerate that program. But we also know we're delivering great glycemic control and outcomes in the market right now. Thanks, Joanne. We -- yes, the integrations with the sensors help us. They give us tailwinds. G7 has been an obvious tailwind for us in the U.S. with our new customer starts. And then the Libre 2 Plus launches have been tailwinds for us in the U.K. and in the Netherlands. So those are positive for us. And as we bring the Libre 2 Plus integration to the U.S., we think that will create another growth tailwind opportunity for us. And then in terms of growth, we have really clear sequential growth in new customer starts in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2. MDI grew for both type 1 and type 2. And we expect to see, as we promised last quarter, we've said all year, we would have sequential growth every year. We delivered that in Q3. In Q4, in the U.S., we will see sequential growth that will also be year-over-year growth in new customer starts and, collectively, Q3 and Q4 in the U.S., we expect very clearly to have year-over-year growth for the second half based upon that dynamic. Sure. Thanks, Matt. First, let me start with the data. The vast majority of our users in the U.S. market are on Omnipod 5. So that's cloud data. So it's very high fidelity. We can tell when somebody has started. We can tell when somebody has stopped. So we have really clear data on this. Our retention remains really high. And so it runs in the, I'm going to say, the low 90s. I will look around the room and make sure that's right. So it runs in low 90s, and it's very stable. It really doesn't move very much period-over-period. It's a very, very stable thing. We're very focused on creating and delivering an experience with our customers that makes it really easy for them to stay on, and we're going to build and continue to build capabilities in that area. But that's to give you a sense of it. It's very stable. It's very high. Very predictable. Thanks, Bill. That's a great question. Actually, we're really focused on building a completely differentiated end-to-end customer experience. In fact, the way we talk about this internally is that's actually what we deliver to people. We deliver an end-to-end customer experience that starts with the moment they might be diagnosed or they might be -- their child might be diagnosed, all the way out to pods for life. And we have, I think, a unique opportunity and a unique capability to do that because of the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5. And so I think our customer service, our customer care, our product support are all really world-class. What -- I'll just say that when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S. in August of 2022, you all might remember, that actually, we had so much demand that, for a period of time there, we had trouble answering the phones. And so there was -- when we started, there was so much demand that we had not really appropriately scaled to support our customers as they got on product and they got trained. Those days are behind us. We've got -- we've scaled our commercial capabilities. We've scaled our customer care. We've scaled our inside sales. We've scaled our product support. And we're laser-focused on building the best end-to-end customer experience for users of Omnipod now and in the future over time. We're really excited about our unique opportunity to do that. Thank you all for joining us today. We have strong sustainable competitive advantages that allow us to deliver market-leading technology, market-leading growth and a strong financial foundation that positions us to continue to drive long-term value creation. Our type 2 label expansion is a game-changer and another major milestone for all stakeholders, including investors, employees, HCPs and most importantly, our customers. I'm proud of the work our team is doing to disrupt the diabetes market and improve the lives of people with diabetes. We have a clear strategy to expand the Omnipod 5 platform, drive growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 and accelerate international growth and expansion. We continue to make significant progress in each of these areas and have strong momentum across our organization. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication, passion, and deep commitment to further our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ana Maria Chadwick",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our global team continues to execute on our mission, and we delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 25% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimate global retention remained stable, and utilization was slightly higher than prior year. As Jim mentioned, we grew both global and U.S. new customer starts sequentially. Foreign currency had a favorable impact on total company reported revenue of 30 basis points versus our guide. U.S. Omnipod growth was 23%, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by ongoing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our U.S. revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by increased volume resulting from our success expanding our customer base. And the Omnipod 5 integration with G7 is quickly gaining momentum. We are excited about the opportunity that our Omnipod 5 type 2 label expansion brings to drive further growth in our business. We are seeing an uptick in type 2 new customer starts following the FDA clearance, which, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect to contribute meaningfully to revenue starting in 2025. Lastly, U.S. utilization trends were consistent with the prior year. Turning to International, where our team delivered another impressive quarter and once again sizably exceeded our expectations. In Q3, we drove growth in all of our international markets. We achieved International Omnipod revenue growth of 35%, primarily fueled by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5. Last year's launches in the U.K. and Germany are driving growth in revenue and new customer starts. And while still early days, we are seeing increased demand for Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands as well as for our recent integrations with Libre 2 Plus. While volume is the largest contributor to revenue growth, International revenue also benefited from higher pricing as new and existing customers adopt Omnipod 5. International utilization trends remained slightly elevated versus the prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw following the U.S. Omnipod 5 launch. We remain well positioned for further growth with more Omnipod 5 launches starting in early 2025. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable 130 basis points over the prior year and 230 basis points versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was $10 million, which was above our guidance range due to an increase in orders from our partner. Gross margin was 69.3%, up 150 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and our international markets as well as ongoing improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to drive margin expansion as we scale and execute on our initiatives to drive operational excellence across our business. Operating margin of 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA of 23.2% both exceeded our expectations, driven by our strong revenue and gross margin performances as well as the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. From a tax perspective, last quarter, we discussed the release of a portion of our valuation allowance. In the third quarter, we released an additional $12 million, resulting in a noncash tax benefit in the period, which has been adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We anticipate releasing the remaining balance of $15 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25% and for this to be the rate in 2025 as well. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $900 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Our commitment to drive margin expansion, profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying up, resulting in our ability to invest in our business and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our outlook, starting with our fourth quarter revenue. We expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 16% and total company growth of 12% to 15%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 9% to 12%. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we benefited from two stocking dynamics, totaling an estimated $30 million to $40 million. On a normalized basis, underlying growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 21% in the midpoint of the guidance range. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 30% to 33%. On a reported basis, we now assume a favorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect fourth quarter Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $7 million to $8 million. As a result of our fourth quarter revenue expectations, we now expect the following for the full year. We are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 21% to 22% and total company revenue growth to a range of 20% to 21%, putting us over $2 billion of total revenue for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and now expect growth of 19% to 21%. For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations to a range of 25% to 27%. On a reported basis, we now assume a 100 basis point tailwind from foreign currency. Our outlook for our International business is strengthened by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5, which has resulted in significant revenue outperformance and are raising International Omnipod full-year outlook by 1,700 basis points since the start of 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, our outlook has improved, and we now expect a smaller decline in the range of 5% to 10%. Turning to 2024 gross and operating margins. Given our strong performance to date and confidence in our outlook, we now expect gross margin to be approximately 69%. We also remain committed to driving further operating margin expansion as we continue to gain efficiencies across our organization and improve our operating leverage. Even as we continue to heavily invest for the long-term profitable growth. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14.5%. In closing, Insulet continues to be the market leader. Our expanding profitability and free cash flow drive our ability to continue to invest in our many growth catalysts. Our cascade of innovation and market expansion strengthen our long runway for sustainable profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Maybe I'll touch on pricing in International. The way to think about it is markets where we've been present with Omnipod 5 a little bit longer, like the U.K. and Germany, are getting to that anniversary time period. So just to remind you, where we've launched Omnipod 5, we've gone to those health ministers -- ministries, and they have given us a premium for that because they see the value. And we anticipate that as we go to new markets -- by the way, France is early stages, but we'll be rolling out in another 10 markets as we move into 2025 here, we anticipate some countries will be going through their annual cycle, not having that bump in a year-over-year variance, but new ones are going to be ramping up. So bottom line is we anticipate to see price accretion in the international markets as we move into 2025. Maybe the other part of the question? Great. I'll start with the guidance and maybe Jim will jump in with some of these competitive dynamics. But we're really excited with our growth prospects and where we're here positioned as we're coming to an end here in the fourth quarter. We are -- as you indicated here, we're going to return to the industry standard of providing guidance as we get to the February marks of our annual cycles. And at that point, we'll be able to provide the best and most complete picture. But just to give you some color, and I'll start here with revenue, which is what drives our entire P&L here. You're very well aware of the cascade of innovations. Really, in the U.S., they really launched here in the second half. And that's where you've seen the sequential new customer starts uptake and those types of things. As you know, we're in the annuity model, so most of that revenue growth will come as we move into 2025. And then for the international markets, I started talking about some markets where we launched earlier, we'll go through that anniversary cycle and new ones will start ramping. So again, those are the key dynamics. I've touched already on a little bit of price in the international markets, where we're going to see greater strength in the U.S. We believe the majority of our growth will come from the base customer start that we're growing right now as we grow our NCS. So again, we feel very well positioned, and we'll provide you a lot more color as we move into February. Great. Thanks, Danielle, for your question. Absolutely correct. At the midpoint, our U.S. Omnipod guidance is below consensus, and it reflects -- I just want to remind everyone, it's a 21% growth on a normalized basis for the stocking activities that we saw a year ago. But at the high end of our guide, we are in line -- the consensus falls within that line. And it reflects actually that U.S. Omnipod will have grown more than 20% in each quarter of the 2024 calendar year. We see a lot of great traction and drivers. We see the trajectory, and we're really well positioned here. Our guidance really reflects our best available information at the moment, and that's what we're giving you all. So we are very excited and very well positioned to be at the midpoint of our full-year guidance range at the 20% mark for U.S. Omnipod. Yes. I'll start with that one. So again, growth over 20%, we're excited by that. The thing to remember is a lot of these NCS sequential and growth we're experiencing also out of our type 2. Given our annuity model, we're going to see more of that benefit as we progress through the quarters here into 2025. So that would be the main driver here for our confidence and our excitement as we move forward. I don't know if there's... Thank you, Jimmy, for that. Great. No, we are very -- we have had delivered very strong margin growth, and we feel very strongly that we will continue. And as I've said before, we're benchmarking here to at least 100 basis points annually of that margin expansion. That's what we've said before, and we continue to believe that. Some of the key components of that margin, as you can tell here, came from the gross margin expansion we have had. In addition, the scale that we have has allowed us to get some leverage in the operating -- in the base operating expenses as well. So as we continue to grow, we anticipate growth in gross margin, and I have also mentioned this before. In gross margin, we anticipate the growth to be more moderate as we move forward. And the reason for that is we have benefited significantly in the U.S. from price appreciation as we have moved out of the DME into the pharmacy channel. And now, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really at 100% of our volume roughly coming in through the pharmacy channel. So that lift will be there going forward, but we have many other levers around efficiencies, around how we have the volumes come from Malaysia and a lot of other things. And in the international markets, we do anticipate some price accretion. So just to wrap it up here, we have benefits coming in from gross margin. And in addition to that, we have the leverage of our scale as we leverage our operating expenses. Maybe I'll just add a perspective with our most recent iOS launch here with -- it applies right now in the U.S. with the G6. But I mean the success that we're seeing with the amount of downloads to speed, how our customers are responding to it and everything, gives us even that greater confidence that we will continue in that path to have more of those available through iOS in the future. So I just wanted to add that commentary. Great. I'll take the first part here. In terms of our international strength and the utilization uptick, we view that nothing to do with stocking. This is entirely to do with when you launch the new product, similar to what we saw in the U.S., probably at a little smaller degree, but people just get maybe a couple of two orders at once just to get some backups for their usage later. So we're seeing some of that similar dynamic in the international markets where we've launched."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDeborah Gordon: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both a replay of this call and the press release discussing our second quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2024 is shaping up to be another year of rapid growth, fueled by strong demand for Omnipod 5 and our accelerating pace of product innovation. Our financial results in Q2 demonstrate our strong execution and significant momentum across all of our markets, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we remain the clear industry leader in automated insulin delivery. The Insulet team is executing at a high level and with increasing velocity, delivering strong financial performance and advancing our strategic initiatives. These first half results reinforce our confidence in an even stronger second half, and another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion as we continue to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations across the board. In light of first half results and continued strong momentum, we increased full year guidance for revenue, gross margin, and operating margin. On today's call, I'll update you on three things; our Q2 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; execution against our 2024 objectives to expand the Omnipod 5 platform globally, and lastly, our ongoing success capturing the value of scale across our business. Starting with financial performance. In Q2, we achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 27% and international growth of 24%. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology landscape. In the U.S., we maintained a strong momentum in new customer starts, achieving sequential growth in Q2, line with our expectations. Our strategy is to drive market expansion through our focus on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. As a result of that focus, we continue to rapidly increase our customer base, while remaining at the forefront of driving overall market expansion. Our growth in the quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI users in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. At a market level, we are seeing an emerging dynamic in which customers who have adopted pump technology are switching manufacturers at a lower rate. As a result of that dynamic and our continuing market leadership in MDI, our new customer starts from competitive switches have become a smaller part of our business. However, we continue to be the net winner in competitive switching, winning more customers than we lose. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our US new customer starts came from people previously using MDI, consistent with the prior quarter, and we continue to take share from our competitors. Across both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations, we benefit from our competitive advantage in the pharmacy channel. The scale and scope we have built in this channel has significantly increased access and simplicity, which in turn helped to drive strong new customer starts and maintain very high customer retention. We're also working hard to continue to increase awareness among prescribers and this work is paying off. A growing number of health care practitioners are writing scripts for Omnipod within both the endocrinologists and primary care physician channels. Insulet is the clear leader in Type 1 and our Omnipod platform also remains the clear choice for people with Type 2. We are excited about the huge opportunity for us in Type 2, subject to FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 label expansion, which we hope to receive this year. I will provide more detail in a few moments. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. In Q2, we were pleased to again deliver international revenue and new customer starts growth ahead of our expectations. As a result of this success, we are significantly raising our international revenue outlook, this time by 600 basis points. We're rapidly approaching $0.5 billion in annual international revenue for 2024, and we're still in the early innings. The accelerated revenue we are achieving returns us to growth rates above 20% at the high end of our international outlook. We've been able to achieve these results with only 2 full country launches and two more just getting started, which signals to us significant runway for continued international growth as we expand access to Omnipod 5 in all of the markets we serve. Earlier this year, we promised that in 2024, we would deliver a cascade of innovation. And in Q2, we continued to do just that, launching multiple platform expansions. Following our successful US limited market release, we entered full release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Full integration with both G6 and G7 allows us to offer even more choice for our customers and capture the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. As a reminder, Omnipod 5 with G7 is now exclusively available through several specialty pharmacies. This has allowed us to deliver an outstanding customer experience and ensure that new customers receive their Omnipod 5 G7 starter packs and Pod seamlessly. Demand for our G7 offering is strong. Early results are promising and in line with our expectations. We have been pleased with the performance of this channel. It is operating at scale, and we can flex to meet ongoing increases in demand. And it allows us to focus our inventory on new customers in the near-term, which we continue to expect will provide us with a tailwind in new customer starts during the second half of the year. Last week, we provided our existing Omnipod 5 customers, a free over-the-air software update, enabling their controllers and compatible smartphones to pair with G7. Existing customers will be able to move to G7 once they see compatible Pods appear in their preferred retail pharmacy. Given the success of our specialty pharmacy launch, we recently made the decision to allow the inventory shift in retail outlets to progress at a more natural pace. This will allow us to minimize any potential confusion for our customers, and our channel partners, while also minimizing the risk of potential product returns and potential impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect the ease of resell pharmacy as usual, will provide an additional new customer starts tailwind as G7 Pods naturally become more widely available, now planned later in Q3. During Q2, we achieved another major milestone with the initial US launch of the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G6, and our limited market release is progressing very well. We are hearing from early users just how Pod liberating the system is. One Podder og shared that \"Omnipod 5, with the iPhone is the biggest innovation since the introduction of AID \u2013 it's a delightful experience having everything on one device.\" We also had a Podder tell us \"Omnipod 5, that's managing diabetes in the background .\" It is gratifying to hear this feedback and it gives us even more confidence in our ability to continue scaling our limited release and then transition to full release in the fall. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the US, we are pleased to announce that we expect to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of this year. We are excited to expand our Omnipod 5 offering to reach customers in the US, who have chosen the Libre family of sensors, and we are confident this portfolio expansion will generate increased demand for Omnipod 5, just as we are seeing in the early days of our launches with Libre 2 Plus internationally. Turning to international. In Q2, we extended the Omnipod 5 platform into new markets and we were the first to offer integration with Abbott's Libre 2 Plus sensor internationally, introducing this integrated offering in the UK and Netherlands. This also marked our first sensor of choice Pod offering, which is compatible with both Libre 2 Plus and G6. We are hearing from ACPs and patients that both integrations are providing an outstanding experience, including how easy it is to start Omnipod 5 using either leading sensor. Further expanding global reach, we recently launched Omnipod 5 in France, which is one of our largest markets. We are in the early days and feedback from patients and HCPs has been fantastic. HCPs have noted the very positive clinical outcomes with particular emphasis on Omnipod 5's simplicity. Demand for Omnipod has always been high in France. And with Omnipod 5, we expect to continue to build on this strength and successfully drive robust adoption as we have seen in our other international launch markets. Omnipod 5 is now available to the majority of our European customers. And of course, we are not stopping there. We are in the final planning stages for additional launches in Italy, the Nordics, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Belgium, with others soon to follow. For all of the countries in our near-term pipeline, you will see us begin local market work to prepare for our planned commercial launches throughout 2025. We will keep you updated on our progress, capitalizing on the enormous international opportunity we are pursuing. Turning to type 2 diabetes, which represents another significant opportunity for growth in our business. We are already the market leader in our space. In the second quarter, people with type 2 represented roughly 25% of our US new customer starts, continuing a strong ongoing trend. The type 2 insulin delivery market is large and significantly underpenetrated. The combined patient population using either intensive insulin therapy or basal insulin is roughly three times the size of the type 1 population. This year, we have had two important pathways for innovation in the type 2 space, both commercial and clinical. As you know, we have been commercially piloting Omnipod GO, a product aimed at the needs of basal-only insulin users. The purpose of that pilot has been to accomplish two main goals: one, determine the optimal way to expand our sales force; and two, develop a better understanding of the patient profile that presents in nonspecialist practices so we can better serve patient needs. This pilot has led to our identifying multiple patient profiles and designing our go-to-market strategy. In parallel, we have been pursuing clinical work to expand our offerings for people with type 2 diabetes, most meaningfully with our pivotal trial with Omnipod 5 called SECURE-T2D. We recently presented the trial data at ADA, and I want to take a moment to summarize some of the key top line results. SECURE-T2D is the largest study ever completed for the use of automated insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes, with approximately 300 people completing the protocol. The study participants were highly diverse and representative of the general population in the US. This is important both from the point of view of HealthEquity and because the study results will be clinically relevant to patients as they present in the real world. The clinical outcomes were striking. Omnipod 5 delivered an average A1c reduction of 0.8 with increasing benefit across the study population as baseline A1cs were higher. Those with the baseline A1c greater than 9 on average achieved an A1c reduction of 2.1. More than half of the participants were concurrently on GLP-1 therapy. And notably, results were the same across all cohorts, whether or not on a GLP-1. Importantly, roughly 20% of study participants were currently on basal-only insulin injections, and they also benefited in line with intensive insulin users. In this population, a key barrier to insulin adoption is the risk of hypoglycemia. And in SECURE-T2D, there was no increase in hypoglycemia. Finally, among several other demonstrated benefits, study participants reported a clinically valid and meaningful reduction in diabetes distress. These remarkable results clearly demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefit for people with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of these results, in June, we filed for expansion of our indications use for Omnipod 5 with the FDA. Now that we have such strong results from our clinical trial work and the rich learnings from our Omnipod GO commercial pilot, these two innovation streams will come together. In anticipation of FDA clearance of our label expansion, during the coming quarters, we will make targeted investments in our sales force to extend our currently successful sales model and expand our feet on the street to further penetrate the Omnipod 5 prescribing base, and we will focus our efforts on Omnipod 5. We strongly believe Omnipod 5 will provide benefit to a wide range of insulin using type 2 patients, both those MDI and those on basal-only insane therapy. Therefore, Omnipod 5 will replace Omnipod GO as our offering for people with type 2 diabetes on basal-only insulin. We are grateful for the patients and the HCPs that participated in our pilot and we look forward to supporting them in their transition to other Omnipod therapies. Leading with Omnicon 5 in this space will enable us to serve more customers by leveraging and streamlining existing operations, supply chain and manufacturing, and it eliminates the need for ongoing investments in product life cycle management for a separate product platform. More importantly, we are confident we have a clear right to win in the type 2 space. We expect to be the first to market in type 2 with an AID offering, and not just any AID offering, but with Omnipod 5, which is the product platform that quickly leapfrogged into market leadership once we launched it in type 1. Omnipod 5 will bring all the benefits to type 2 patients that it already delivers, ease of access to the pharmacy channel, low to no upfront cost, market-leading ease of use and the unique discretion and convenience of a wearable, disposable patch pump with the day-to-day simplicity of full phone control with both Android and iOS. All of that, while delivering the striking clinical benefits we have just established with our pivotal trial. We are excited to bring the best automated insulin delivery offer to the type 2 market by the end of this year, pending clearance by the FDA. Ana will have more detail on the financial impact of our refined strategy in a few moments, but the biggest financial impact will be the opening of a new addressable market for us which we fully expect will fuel our growth. Before I hand over to Ana, I'd like to briefly discuss our expanded global manufacturing capabilities. We've been successfully investing in process innovation in our Insulet facility, which is meaningfully contributing to gross margin expansion. And we have made significant investment in the new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Malaysia, which will enable us to scale faster and expand margins and cash flow. We are thrilled to have begun producing sellable Omnipod 5 product in Q2 in Malaysia ahead of schedule. Our new facility is over two times the size of our US facility, and we expect it to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production, ramping as volumes increase. Our advantages and scale position us to grow our global business profitably and seamlessly meet the growing demand for Omnipod 5, which represents an important and distinct advantage over competitors. Shortly after this call, several members of our executive team will travel to Malaysia to attend our facilities official grand opening. We look forward to celebrating this occasion with our local team as well as the many other Insulet employees globally who helped to make this happen. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We have significant momentum throughout our global business and elivered another strong quarter of financial results strategic execution. Most importantly, our global team continues to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 23% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimated global retention remained stable. The foreign currency impact on total company revenue on a reported basis was approximately 80 basis points favorable versus our reported guidance. US Omnipod revenue growth was 27%, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 is the primary driver of our strong growth, while our integration with G7 is gaining momentum. We are excited to have launched our US full market release with G7 in June, and we will continue to face into our channel partners over the coming months. I will speak more to this dynamic in a few moments. Our year-over-year US revenue growth was primarily driven by our success expanding our customer base and increasing volume throughout the pharmacy channel, including premium Omnipod. This was partially offset by an estimated $10 million reduction of inventory in the channel as we manage the Omnipod 5 G6 to G7 transition, which was in line with our expectations. US utilization trends were slightly lower than prior year as a result of Omnipod 5's significant ramp in the first full year of launch in 2023. As it relates to our US revenue expectations, we estimate approximately half of our beat versus the high end guidance was due to our strong commercial execution. The other half was due to pricing benefits from channel mix as well as fewer G6 pod returns than anticipated. Our underlying growth is strong. We have significant momentum, and we are thrilled to have expanded our product offering and provide greater choice for our customers. With our lead position in the market and the many catalysts for us this year, we are in a great position to continue to deliver robust revenue and customer base growth in 2024 and well beyond. Turning to international. We achieved international Omnipod revenue growth of 24%. These results were once again well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH is doing very internationally and remains a sizable percentage of our overall international volume, Omnipod 5's demand is very high and fueling our growth. Last year's launch in the UK and Germany are driving both revenue and new customer start growth. Although early, the increased demand we're seeing in France as a result of our recent Omnipod 5 launch is very encouraging. Together with our with our rollout of Omnipod 5 Libre 2+ in two of markets around the start of 2Q, we are well positioned for continued growth. International utilization trends were slightly higher than in prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw last year in the US, but to a smaller degree. On a reported basis, foreign currency was 90 basis points headwind over the prior year and approximately 110 basis points favorable versus our guide. Drug delivery revenue was $8 million, which was above our guidance range, partially due to an increase in orders from our partner and timing of production. Gross margin was 67.7%, up 90 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the US pharmacy channel and our international markets, as well as ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting this growth was a onetime charge of $13.5 million, or 280 basis points relating to components that are not expected to be utilized. This charge resulted from our strategic decision to go market with Omnipod 5 instead of Omnipod GO to drive accelerated growth in type 2 pending FDA clearance. Even with this charge, our execution throughout our global business is resulting in significant margin expansion, which strengthens our confidence in our margin trajectory over the long-term as we continue to execute and scale efficiently. While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including to support the cascade of innovations we've had this year and those to come, our level of spend was lower than we expected due to a timing shift into the second half of the year. In order to drive the above-market growth we have been delivering, we will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we are achieving margin expansion resulting from our revenue performance, gross margin improvements and the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. Operating margin was 11.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 18.6% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to our revenue outperformance and the shift in timing of spend. Expansion of these metrics was partially offset by the onetime charge of $13.5 million or 280 basis points related to Omnipod GO. Last quarter, we provided color that due to our positive earnings trend, we may find at some point in the year that the valuation allowance we had against our deferred tax assets may no longer be required. In Q2, we reached this conclusion, and therefore, we released the majority of our valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $150 million in the period, which we adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We expect another $30 million to be recognized during the remainder of the year. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding the full $180 million to be in the range of 20% to 25%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $820 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Last week, we successfully extended the maturity of our Term Loan B to August 2031 and repriced the loan at a lower interest rate, which will reduce cumulative interest expense over the term of the loan by approximately $17 million. Our commitment to drive profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying off, resulting in our ability to expand margins and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 18% to 21%, representing a milestone of $2 billion in annual revenue at the high end of our range. As a result, we also are raising total company revenue growth to a range of 16% 19%. For US Omnipod, we're raising the low end of our revenue guidance and now expect a range of 18% to 21% growth. We expect growth be driven primarily by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the reoccurring revenue stream from our annuity model and growing customer base. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of 2024 versus the prior year period resulting from the estimated orders that were accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 2024. We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half. While we continue to expect sequential growth in new customer starts in both Q3 and Q4, our guidance now contemplates a less steep ramp of new customer starts in the second half of 2024, driven by both the overall market reduction in competitive switching that Jim referred to, and the slightly longer facing period of our G7 Pods through our retail channel partners. While the latter has a temporary impact on new customer starts during the second half, it is simply timing. We are confident this strategy will maximize the customer and HCP experience, which is our top priority, while having the added benefit of limiting returns of the G6 Pod in the channel. Our revenue guidance continues to assume a gradual restocking in the second half of this year as we expand our distribution of G7 Pods throughout all channel partners. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 600 basis points to a range of 18% to 21%. On a reported basis, we now assume there will be no foreign currency impact. We anticipate revenue growth to be driven by the strong momentum from last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. Our 2024 outlook for international business is strengthened every day by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5. Greater-than-expected new customer starts today, as well as revenue outperformance, has resulted in raising our international Omnipod outlook by 1,100 basis points since the start of 2024. Omnipod 5 is gaining traction and taking share. Feedback has been tremendous, and we are clearly a leader with our advanced technology. While we expect our most recent Omnipod 5 launches to contribute new customer starts in the second half of this year, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect them to contribute even more meaningfully to revenue in 2025. Our incredible momentum internationally strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will drive further growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both US and International Omnipod, our guidance factors in quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in the channel for new launches and reducing levels of prior Omnipod generations. Lastly, for drug delivered, our outlook has improved and we now expect a decline in the range of 40% to 50%, reflecting our partner's revised forecast. Turning to 2024 gross margin. Given our strong margin performance in the first half of 2024 and the retirement of some risks we had modeled related to our product launches and new manufacturing facility, we have greater confidence in our full year 2024 outlook. As a result, we now expect to land closer to the high end of our 68% to 69% range, even with the 70 basis points annualized impact from the second quarter Omnipod GO charge. We are in a tremendous position to drive further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to executing our strategy to deliver this growth. We remain committed to driving operating margin expansion as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. Even as we continue to heavily invest in commercial, clinical and R&D to fuel our strong revenue growth trajectory. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14%. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 21% to 24% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, primarily driven by strong demand for Omnipod 5, stronger customer starts and the benefit of our immunity model. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, driven by ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $4 million. In conclusion, our global Insulet team continues to execute and drive strong results. We generated robust new customer starts globally and our cascade of innovation strengthens our position to deliver sustained revenue growth and margin expansion this year and beyond. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a really nice quarter. I want to ask some clarifying questions here. I'll just get them all in. First, gross margin would have been something closer to 70.5% operating margin and EBITDA would have been materially higher without the onetime charge to write down the inventory. I guess, what was the reason to leave it in and not back it out? I think most companies would have backed it out. And then second, I think there's just a little confusion on the commentary around the new patient ramp in the second half. Maybe you could just add a little clarifying commentary to that? Is it less new patients? Is it related to type 2 specifically? Is it competitive switches? Just make it crystal clear the view and can you grow new patients year-over-year. Thanks a lot.\nA \u2013 Jim Hollingshead: Thanks, Robbie. It's great to have you on the call. Thanks for your question, and thanks for your congrats. I'll start on the new customer start question, and then I'll hand back to Ana to talk about the margin and the onetime charge. So a new customer starts we're trying to describe what we see in the market really, really clearly. And the first thing is had good sequential increase in new customer starts, which was our goal and we hit along those guides. What we're seeing in the market, we're trying to characterize the trend we've seen in the market. So we were up in MDI in both type 1 and type 2. And looking to the quarter, what we see is a dynamic where just in installed base and market-wide, competitive switching for patients already in the installed base is down. And there was some question as we've looked at the data, to what extent that was seasonality over the last couple of quarters. But I think looking back, we can see that it's just clear that the total pool of competitive switchers is just down. And one of the reasons for that, course, is that over the last several quarters, we've grown our percentage of the installed base really substantially. So there are a lot of Omnipod users out there, mostly Omnipod 5 users out there that are not targets for us to switch. But it's part of the market that -- it's a smaller part of the market overall, and it's a smaller part of what's going on in the market. The important thing that we're trying to convey is that, for us, the play is MDI. So if you think about it, somewhere between 8 or 9 out of 10 of our new customer starts are coming from MDI and only about one new customer start comes out of competitive switching for us. And so that's very, very clear. That's our strategy. That's what we're trying to do. Omnipod 5 is so appealing. We're the player that's growing the market, and we're clearly leading and we continue to clearly lead in MDI. Having said that, we also continued to win in the competitive switching game. We win more customers than we lose. But we're trying to characterize for all of you what see happening as an overall trend in the market. Our play will continue to be to grow the market because Omnipod 5 allows us to bring more patients in, and we clearly lead in that, very consistent with our overall strategy. Ana, do you want to pick up on the margin question?\nA \u2013 Ana Maria Chadwick: Sure. So absolutely, thank you, Jim, for that. Background here is we do not adjust for operational items. But what we tried to do during the script and in our earnings press release, we give you all the puts and takes of the 280 basis points that flows through from gross margin to up margin for the quarter and for the full year, the 70 basis points. So you can see we're adjusting that one-timer, we're executing incredibly well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Jeff Johnson: Thank you. Jim, maybe I can ask one clarifying question on your new starts and I do have one of the questions that implied fourth quarter guidance. But on the new starts, I think I heard you saying that your new starts were up sequentially, I just want to confirm that and make sure that the US, global or what number is that? And is that everything combined, kind of the MDI plus competitive convert, you put it on a lot of new starts overall to the company. We're up either US or globally and then like I said, I have one question on the fourth quarter.\nA \u2013 Jim Hollingshead: Yeah. So yeah, so Jeff, thank you for the question. New starts were up, both in the US sequentially and internationally sequentially. Just to be clear.\nJeff Johnson: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the implied fourth quarter guidance, either for Ana or for you, Jim. When I look at the U.S. Omnipod guidance, depending on what I pick is the midpoint or the point -- I decided to in 3Q within your guidance, the implied kind of the fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth probably where from low single-digits to low double-digits, the bigger range there because we're taking a point estimate in 3Q. You obviously had anywhere from 6 to 9 points depending on how much we count the pull forward into 4Q 2023 last year, that's kind of a year-over-year headwind. When I put all that in the hopper, it seems like you're kind of talking about fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth in the low to mid-teens. One, is that a reasonable way to think about how you're thinking about adjusted U.S. Omnipod growth? And is that where we should be thinking about as kind of a stepping off point for 2025? Or is there other things in 2025, like type 2 in that, that can maybe take you above that low to mid-teens U.S. Omnipod growth? Thank you.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Jeff, I'll start with that. Thanks for the question. You are absolutely correct. There are absolutely a lot of puts and takes, especially in the fourth quarter. The important thing to recall here is that our overall guidance for the year continues to be strong, and I know you're referring here specific to the U.S. with that high end of our guidance at that 21%. So, we raised the volume at 18% up to the 21%. I do want to mention something as we think of 2025, which we are not providing guidance during this call. We'll wait until we wrap-up the fourth quarter. We have a lot of things transpiring here, as Jim mentioned in the second half of the year. G7, we have iOS. We have Libre 2 Plus. We have the international that it's really ramping incredibly nicely and more countries ahead and we have the type 2 label extension. Once we have more clarity into the later part of the year, we'll come back and provide that additional guidance.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Jim, one clarification on new starts for me. Did you say overall U.S. starts -- new starts to be up in Q3 and Q4?\nJim Hollingshead: Yes. So, Larry, I know we're actually going to get a lot of clarifying questions on this. I'll just -- let me see if I can characterize it clearly. I'll give it another try. So, we expect sequential growth in the U.S. in new customer starts in Q3 and then again in Q4. And that's consistent with what we've said over the course of the last two quarters, where we expect the second half to be stronger and sequentially stronger two, three, four -- Q2, Q3, Q4 over the course of the year. And the ramp characteristics remain the same. The big tailwind driver for us is G7 and then we have other tailwinds coming. I think that one question that I'm sure people are asking themselves is what does that mean in terms of where we land. And there's two things that have changed in the quarter. One is, as I said, there's a smaller portion of the market overall is competitive switching, although we continue to win clearly in competitive switching. And the other thing is, as we said in the prepared comments, is our G7 launch is going very well through the specialty pharmacy channel and the ramp is good. Demand is good. We're servicing it really well. But we made the decision because of that to not disrupt the customer experience and the channel experience to let inventory flow more naturally into that channel. And so both of those things create a little bit -- I would say, a little bit of a change in our outlook on total new customer starts in the second half. And so as Ana characterized in her comments, we expect a steep ramp, but the ramp in the second half is probably a little bit less steep than we had been expecting before. Now where that lands in terms of total year new customer starts, is hard to characterize each of those -- each of those two dynamics are kind of hard to quantify neither of them is that big. But combined, what we're expecting is a less steep ramp in the second half, but still a really good ramp in the second half in new customer starts in the U.S.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. So Jim thanks. And so margins, that's what I wanted to ask about. If I take out the onetime charge in the second quarter, your gross margin in the first half, I think, was about 70%. The implied -- even with keeping the one-time charge in, it's about 68.5%. So why the lower -- lower gross margin in the second half versus the underlying first half? And how should we think about the benefit to your gross margin from Malaysia beyond 2024? Thanks.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Yes. Let me jump into that. So in the first quarter, we had gross margin of 69.5%, and now we have 67.7%. So that gets us shy of the 69%. And in the second half, we expect to be, as you can imagine, we're guiding to the full 69%. So that's going to be higher than the 69% to make the overall. So that guidance, I just want to be clear, contemplates that contemplates that 70 -- for the full year 70 basis points of pressure, we did not back that out from our guidance. We kept the Omnipod GO charge that we took this quarter in our guidance. So hopefully, helps answer the question. Malaysia has a more limited impact. So as it's starting to produce product. And we expect to get more of that benefit, as we move into 2025 and the first full year of running operations.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is opens.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one on International and one in the U.S., and apologies for having both in here. But internationally, obviously, you're seeing a tremendous amount of traction. So can you give us some sense around how much of the beaten guidance range this quarter is related to new patient adds in these two countries, the two new countries that you are in? Are seeing kind of this change in MDI starts just in general, where you can start to say, hey, this is a market trend. This isn't just, hey, we're taking competitive switches or more new patient adds, which I'm sure is part of it. But just trying to get a sense of what's going on, on the ground? And is it happening similar as we saw in the U.S. a few years ago. And then just on the U.S. side and this is a clarification question that may be helpful may not. But the change in competitive converts, historically, 20% of new patient adds or competitive converts. Now you're saying it's 15%. So the delta seems pretty minor 5% but correct me if I'm wrong on that. Thank you.\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. I'll take both of those. On international, we're so pleased with Omnipod 5 internationally. It clearly wins wherever we're able to take it. The U.K. launch continues to go extremely well. The Germany launch is going extremely well and off a very strong performance in previous quarters, we -- both of those countries continue to perform ahead of expectation. We've just launched in France. It's very early. France is a really big market for us, but we know we have big demand, and we're rolling that out. We have patients on product and that's beginning to ramp. And then the other launch is, of course, the Netherlands. And -- when we launched the Netherlands, that was our first -- when we entered that country, entered it with our sensor of choice offering, which is G6 and Libre 2, and we took that center of choice offering into the UK, where we were already on market with G6, and that offering is going great. So these are largely MDI growth, driven growth phenomenon in all of those countries. As you know, internationally, most people who are on technology are locked into their contracts. And so it's largely MDI new-to-market customers. Many of them are already on a CGM because CGM paves a road for us, but they're largely new to market pumpers, and we're really, really pleased with the performance, and it makes us very bullish as we continue to roll out Omnipod 5 internationally. On the US dynamic, yes, I mean we're trying to characterize it. It's a little bit odd. We know there's lots of questions about what's going on out there. But you're right, the mix shift is -- that kind of percentage mix shift. That's consistent with what we had last quarter, 85-15. But as we look at the market, what we see as a trend now where just total base of competitive switching out there is smaller. It's a smaller part of the market. It's never been our focus in the business. It's not our focus. Now our focus is market growth. But that 85-15 split is actually not that big a deal. We just want to characterize the dynamic. MDI, we were up in MDI type 1 in the US., up in MDI in type 2, and we very clearly lead in MDI. Although we also win in competitive switching, that's a smaller part of our market and a lower emphasis for us strategically.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, I wanted to clarify a couple of things from the earlier questions. So Jim, did you say new starts can grow year-over-year in the second half of the year? And also I wanted to clarify, you were commenting on demand is good, but you made a decision to disrupt the customer experience and let inventory grow naturally. So that creates a [indiscernible] in the outlook in the second half? So I really wanted to understand kind of what you make...\nJim Hollingshead: Travis, It's -- I hope I didn't say it that way. I meant the exact opposite of what you just said, which is we don't want to disrupt customer experience. So what's going on with the specialty pharmacy launch, we've used that kind of specialty pharmacy approach a couple of times in the past, especially as we entered pharmacy. We've actually upgraded the way do it, so with this launch. And with -- this is the first time that we've brought kind of a new compatibility to the Pod into the same channel under the same reimbursement code. And so figuring out how to feather that in and focus our built inventory on new customers has been what we've been designing to do. And we decided to take that into pharma -- into the specialty pharmacies because it allows us to focus on new starts rather than driving a lot of conversion in the base, which doesn't grow our customer base, right? So by taking it through specialty pharmacy, we're focusing on growing our new customer base, which is really important to the business and brings new customers into the market. And as we did that, it wasn't fair to us as we planned it because it was the first time what dynamic would be. The dynamic is great. We're actually really well able to service very strong demand for G7 through specialty pharmacies. And saying that, I should also point out, those specialty pharmacies, the most of them were through multiple pharmacies there through kind of a hub service that we've set up. And most of them are not visible to third-party data. So if people are out there trying to watch our new customer starts, they won't be able to see most of our G7 starts through other reporting mechanisms, for example, like IQVIA. So demand is really good, and it's flowing so well and we can flex it. And so that customer experience has been great. Therefore, we've decided not to force inventory into the retail channel, which would be potentially disruptive both for our channel partners and for customers. So we're going through specialty pharmacy. It's going very well, and we're going to let the inventory transition in retail at a more natural pace. So that's why it's really because of a new customer -- we want to deliver the strongest possible customer experience, and we're happy with how specialty pharmacy is going. So that's on that question. On the first part of your question, year-over-year growth, I think we expect during the second half to cross over into year-over-year growth, it's hard to call exactly when that happens. But the expectation is yes, we get year-over-year growth in the second half.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Polark: Thank you. Okay. I'll ask a follow-up on the Type 2 update. The decision to prioritize 05 over go, I'm interested -- is your expectation that that the SECURE-T2D label or data will allow you to market both the MDI and basal-only population? That's one question. And then the second piece is pricing? Would you expect kind of patient-agnostic pricing for this product? And the third is -- I heard about the investments in the back half to set the stage for the Type 2 launch next year. Any way to frame how much you expect to expand head count through this process? Thank you so much.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. The first thing is, yes, I don't want to get too far in front of the FDA on the actual label, but the label we anticipate would allow us to market to both intensive insulin and basal insulin users. So that's the aim. And SECURE-T2D backs that up because 20% of the participants in SECURE-T2D were basal-only users, and they have fantastic results. And so the goal of Omnipod 5 is to get out there and help people who are on insulin who need better control because of the fantastic smart adjust algorithm and its ability to -- as you know, we adjust both basal and adjust for real-time bolus. And so that's the goal. And therefore, if we're able to achieve that labeling, we can help basal-only patients with Omnipod 5. And I know that know that you the initial plan was to start people on Omnipod GO and then as their insulin needs change get them on to Omnipod 5. And the beauty of this strategy is that we don't have to wait to have people going to Omnipod 5. Contingent on FDA labeling, which we expect, and I don't want to get in front of it and all those caveats, we think we can just -- we don't have to wait for Omnipod 5, we just take it to market as Omnipod 5 and meet the needs of a very wide range of patients than we were going to be able to meet. So we're excited about that. And Ana forgotten already the second part of your question. So...\nAna Maria Chadwick: No, I just wanted to add maybe a comment there. When you think of the implications of that decision, it's not just a short-term impact that we just talked about. There is a much longer-term impact. Jim commented on the customer, commercial, all those things that there's also an operational impact in the company with less product life cycles, simpler in terms of our manufacturing capacity and operational and all those things that come along with that. It's going to have its fruits much longer into the 2025.\nJim Hollingshead: Yes, we're really excited about being able to go on to the Omnipod 5 platform as the flagship offer there. I remember your other two components, Mike, so quickly on pricing. We don't anticipate -- I mean, Omnipod 5 is already well covered, well reimbursed for people with Type 2 diabetes. There's -- right now, there's no distinction, and we don't expect big commercial changes on that front. We'll see what happens, but we don't expect any disruption. And then on the other side of that, with the sales force, we've been successfully adding sales force heads now for some time. We added some earlier in the year. We'll continue to add sales force. We'll have more to say about the scale of that and the model for that as we get closer to actual launch.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thank you for the question. Maybe I could just further get some color and help clarify a couple key things we've been talking about on the call. One is I did want to ask you about -- you mentioned channel mix benefits in this quarter. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the source of those? And I guess just the outlook for that in the US and as a company, as you have a lot of shipping sand in terms of the different channels and how the mix could evolve?\nAna Maria Chadwick: Sure. I'll start with that one. So when you think of the US, and we are very heavily penetrated now in the pharmacy channel, what we have is we ship product and then we have, of course, the wholesalers, the distributors and the PBMs, and at the end, it's the end customers. So how it moves into, which specific distributors with what relationships, and which PBMs with what coverage. That all is hard to call. And now what we're talking about is not huge dollars, what I described in terms of the impact, but we should have some fluctuation in our pricing as we go through that process. So we will continue to refine our models and just continue to get better and better around that. But it's really a simple dynamic of being now so heavy into the pharmacy channel.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. I had one on International and one on the GO decision. On OUS, by our math, your International installed base share is well-below where you are in the US. I'm curious though, when we look at that overall international market, what percentage of those patients are in geographies where you have a presence today? In other words, how much of that pie are you really able to compete for?\nJim Hollingshead: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Internationally, as you know, we're only in 24 markets OUS. And the larger markets are obviously the usual suspects of large markets, UK, Germany, France, Nordics. And so we're in the U. with Omnipod 5 now in Germany with full releases and growing really, really well. France, we're just out of the gate with the Omnipod 5 launch in France. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, Nordics is on the list for coming launches. And then -- and you can -- just by population, I think all the medtech markets are fairly similar in terms of total opportunity. So we feel really good about where we are with Omnipod 5. It's clearly winning where we take it. And as we roll it out, we're very bullish on growth, which is what led us to another 600 basis point increase in guide.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nMike Kratky: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just a couple on the type 2 launch. First of all, is your plan to implement a full commercial launch in type 2 once you get approval? Or could that be a more sequence launch? And then maybe just a quick one on the basal-only population, but based on the updates today, can you provide some color on the level of demand that you saw for pumps in the basal-only population? And does that change your outlook at all as you think about Omnipod 5?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Mike. In terms of full commercial launch, I mean, what we've done is we've choreographed our plan for the launch in line with what we expect in terms of FDA approval. And so -- we expect FDA approval by the end of the year. And once we have that and with all the other pieces in place in terms of things like sales force training so on, we'll be able to promote in line with that. But we also anticipate, as I said, we'll say more -- we'll give more detail as we get closer to that. We anticipate also expanding our sales reach into nonspecialty channels by adding some feet on the street. And that just gives us more share voice into those markets. And so we'll have more to say about that later. But we do anticipate being able promote as we get clearance. The second side of your question around basal -- thank you. With basal, Omnipod GO product, we were out there looking at how do patients present in the channel. And we saw a number of patient profiles. So we went in with draft patient profile that I won't try to detail. We then -- we added a patient profile to that. And what we found was that there are a lot of patients in the non-specialty channel. There's different patient profiles with type 2 diabetes that need insulin, and there's also a lot of type 1 patients in there. So we're very confident that there's a lot of patients that -- whose needs we can address with Omnipod 5. And if anything, I would say, focusing on to Omnipod 5 makes us even more bullish about our ability to penetrate that market. So we learned a lot as we are in those practices about what's happening in there and which kinds of patients are in there. And we're really excited about taking Omnipod 5 as the flagship product for the patient journey into those channels and to reach those patients.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open\nQ \u2013 Jayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. I've got 15 clarifying questions. I'm just kidding. Just -- just quickly couple of type 2s. Are you seeing any benefit from the type 2 data that you presented at ADA in late June? And then second, you seem more confident in the timing of type 2 approval for Omnipod 5. Just to be clear, you're confident that reimbursement is in place. There's not going to be a lag in adoption because of reimbursement? Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Jason, and thanks for the non 15 question list. So that -- so on type 2, yes, we're very confident. I mean, type 2 -- Omnipod 5 right now is reimbursed through the pharmacy benefit. There's not a request for which type of diabetes. It's a script that's written for Omnipod 5, and it's very well covered on that basis, and that's why physicians are writing off label for it. We did see an increase in MDI starts for type 2 patients in the quarter. We don't call out whether that's Omnipod DASH, which has the full indication for user, Omnipod 5. We did see some lift in MDI for type 2. We are not promoting Omnipod 5 for type 2 diabetes because we do yet have the indication for use expansion that will allow us to do that. And our reps, as I've said before, have one arm tied behind their back for that. So we're really bullish on that. But we have seen some lift. And we think the coverage should be final. There shouldn't be any delay in coverage for Omnipod 5 in type 2.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Matthew O'Brien: Thanks for taking the question. I'm so sorry, I do have a clarifying one. What's this inventory tailwind you should be getting in the second half of year? I'd love to know about that. And then my main question is really on the MDI side. If I look at the results for you guys for a couple of your competitors, it looks like the MDI penetration rates are starting to accelerate, first of all, is that true? Secondly, what's driving it? Is it new technologies? And just how durable is it between type 1 and type 2s just given how important it's going to be for you guys going forward as you grow your business? Thanks.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Thanks, Matt. So I'll start with your comment on inventory tailwinds. So as we talked about last quarter, we were anticipating a destocking of about $10 million, which we saw happened during the second quarter. And what we anticipate is during the second half of the year that should come back. And the reason it is all around the G6, G7 transition and how we're managing the channel through that process.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. On the MDI question. I won't try to probably together any of our competitors' results. I'll just say that I think it's reasonable to think that MDI penetration in type 1 is accelerating, and we're clearly leading that. So Omnipod 5 is very highly preferred with MDI patients. We continue to grow that space and we continue to win with MDI conversions. I think it's durable for both type 1 and type 2. And the reason I believe that is because the burden of living with diabetes remains very high and because our CGM partners have been out paving road very effectively in front of us for some time. And so, we've said before that we think penetration for AID in the type 1 space can go very high, well above 70% on the back of the pave road from CGM, and we're confident that we're going to be the leader that drives that kind of penetration. And we believe that now you see a lot of adoption in type 2 space with CGMs on an ongoing basis. And so our two partners, Abbott and Dexcom, are out there paving road for us in type 2, and we see a big opportunity to take Omnipod 5 likely as the first-to-market AID system in that space, you see a big opportunity to drive the penetration of Omnipod 5 and type 2 as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. On the international strength you were seeing versus you're thinking heading into the year, are you seeing better reimbursement and pricing in addition to faster new patient growth? Or is it is it -- all better volume? And can you remind us when you could have a G7 connectivity internationally?\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Steve. Yes. So what we've done, and we've referred to this in the past, as we launch Omnipod 5, we work really hard to make sure that our reimbursement is commensurate with the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates for the health care system and for patients. And so we've been able to, so far, so good, successfully negotiate a premium for Omnipod 5, where we've launched it. And so it is both volume and a bit of a price benefit. And -- but volumes are very, very good, obviously, with -- the starts are very, very strong for us with Omnipod 5 where we've taken it. And then again, I'm forgetting the second half of the...\nAna Maria Chadwick: The G7 International.\nJim Hollingshead: G7, we haven't announced timing. So we're obviously working on it. We have a very effective working G7 integration, which is creating a big tailwind for us in the US, we'll get it into European markets as soon as we can, but we have not yet announced timing.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question and very nice quarter. Yesterday, there was an announcement that I think took a lot of people by surprise, the agreement between Medtronic and Abbott. I would love your opinion on how this changes or doesn't change the AID, and really diabetes delivery landscape. Thanks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thanks, Joanne. Yes, we're very happy with our two CGM partners. We have a great relationship with Abbott. We have a great relationship with Dexcom. We're working really well with both of them. We're very excited to announce that we'll be bringing the Libre 2+ integration to the US market by the end of the year. And for us, we have a clear road map for Omnipod 5 platform expansion that includes sensor expansions, and it's full speed ahead. We remain very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 is extremely differentiated from two pumps and will continue to be. And so we're very bullish full speed ahead with both of our partners.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question. That will be from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nBill Plovanic: Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. In terms of the gross margin, from shifting over to Malaysia, how much gross margin longer-term benefits should we see from that? And then how much do you pick up by eliminating GO, which potentially was probably a lower gross profit product, I would assume. Just kind of curious what that does for the longer-term GMs. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAna Maria Chadwick: Great. Let me get started on that. So as we commented, we have really strong gross margin once you back out the impact -- the one-time impact of GO. We have stated before and continue to state Malaysia strategic for us. In the first 12 years, we will be accretive. So at the moment, we're ramping, so that will take time. So you can expect that, that will be accretive right at around that one-year mark and will continue to be. And the other point being the product life cycle. So by taking manufacturing time away from shifting lines and all of those things, we'll anticipate that. We're not providing long-term guidance here. So we'll come back and provide more color after we wrap up here in 2024. I do want to take the opportunity to come back to some of the early questions on new customer starts and clarify just to make sure everybody is on the same page. So new on customer starts, we expect sequential growth, second quarter to third quarter, third quarter to fourth quarter that to be true, US, international, of course, globally. And we already talked about all the reasons why that would happen. The question came up around year-over-year. And I want to also reiterate not only globally because it's obvious that international is working so well, but to a lesser extent, but it's there. Our guidance contemplates year-over-year growth in US NCS. So I just wanted to make sure that that was clarified for everyone.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer section. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks.\nJim Hollingshead: Thank you, operator. In closing, we're very pleased with our Q2 and excited about our coming second half. Our cascade of innovation continues with our G7 tailwind, iOS and Libre 2 coming to the US and we're eagerly anticipating TAM expansion with FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 and type 2. Our international business continues to outperform on the strength of Omnipod 5. All of that led us to raise our guide across the board.

            "name": "Jim Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2024 is shaping up to be another year of rapid growth, fueled by strong demand for Omnipod 5 and our accelerating pace of product innovation. Our financial results in Q2 demonstrate our strong execution and significant momentum across all of our markets, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we remain the clear industry leader in automated insulin delivery. The Insulet team is executing at a high level and with increasing velocity, delivering strong financial performance and advancing our strategic initiatives. These first half results reinforce our confidence in an even stronger second half, and another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion as we continue to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations across the board. In light of first half results and continued strong momentum, we increased full year guidance for revenue, gross margin, and operating margin. On today's call, I'll update you on three things; our Q2 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; execution against our 2024 objectives to expand the Omnipod 5 platform globally, and lastly, our ongoing success capturing the value of scale across our business. Starting with financial performance. In Q2, we achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 27% and international growth of 24%. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology landscape. In the U.S., we maintained a strong momentum in new customer starts, achieving sequential growth in Q2, line with our expectations. Our strategy is to drive market expansion through our focus on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. As a result of that focus, we continue to rapidly increase our customer base, while remaining at the forefront of driving overall market expansion. Our growth in the quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI users in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. At a market level, we are seeing an emerging dynamic in which customers who have adopted pump technology are switching manufacturers at a lower rate. As a result of that dynamic and our continuing market leadership in MDI, our new customer starts from competitive switches have become a smaller part of our business. However, we continue to be the net winner in competitive switching, winning more customers than we lose. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our US new customer starts came from people previously using MDI, consistent with the prior quarter, and we continue to take share from our competitors. Across both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations, we benefit from our competitive advantage in the pharmacy channel. The scale and scope we have built in this channel has significantly increased access and simplicity, which in turn helped to drive strong new customer starts and maintain very high customer retention. We're also working hard to continue to increase awareness among prescribers and this work is paying off. A growing number of health care practitioners are writing scripts for Omnipod within both the endocrinologists and primary care physician channels. Insulet is the clear leader in Type 1 and our Omnipod platform also remains the clear choice for people with Type 2. We are excited about the huge opportunity for us in Type 2, subject to FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 label expansion, which we hope to receive this year. I will provide more detail in a few moments. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. In Q2, we were pleased to again deliver international revenue and new customer starts growth ahead of our expectations. As a result of this success, we are significantly raising our international revenue outlook, this time by 600 basis points. We're rapidly approaching $0.5 billion in annual international revenue for 2024, and we're still in the early innings. The accelerated revenue we are achieving returns us to growth rates above 20% at the high end of our international outlook. We've been able to achieve these results with only 2 full country launches and two more just getting started, which signals to us significant runway for continued international growth as we expand access to Omnipod 5 in all of the markets we serve. Earlier this year, we promised that in 2024, we would deliver a cascade of innovation. And in Q2, we continued to do just that, launching multiple platform expansions. Following our successful US limited market release, we entered full release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Full integration with both G6 and G7 allows us to offer even more choice for our customers and capture the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. As a reminder, Omnipod 5 with G7 is now exclusively available through several specialty pharmacies. This has allowed us to deliver an outstanding customer experience and ensure that new customers receive their Omnipod 5 G7 starter packs and Pod seamlessly. Demand for our G7 offering is strong. Early results are promising and in line with our expectations. We have been pleased with the performance of this channel. It is operating at scale, and we can flex to meet ongoing increases in demand. And it allows us to focus our inventory on new customers in the near-term, which we continue to expect will provide us with a tailwind in new customer starts during the second half of the year. Last week, we provided our existing Omnipod 5 customers, a free over-the-air software update, enabling their controllers and compatible smartphones to pair with G7. Existing customers will be able to move to G7 once they see compatible Pods appear in their preferred retail pharmacy. Given the success of our specialty pharmacy launch, we recently made the decision to allow the inventory shift in retail outlets to progress at a more natural pace. This will allow us to minimize any potential confusion for our customers, and our channel partners, while also minimizing the risk of potential product returns and potential impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect the ease of resell pharmacy as usual, will provide an additional new customer starts tailwind as G7 Pods naturally become more widely available, now planned later in Q3. During Q2, we achieved another major milestone with the initial US launch of the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G6, and our limited market release is progressing very well. We are hearing from early users just how Pod liberating the system is. One Podder og shared that \"Omnipod 5, with the iPhone is the biggest innovation since the introduction of AID \u2013 it's a delightful experience having everything on one device.\" We also had a Podder tell us \"Omnipod 5, that's managing diabetes in the background .\" It is gratifying to hear this feedback and it gives us even more confidence in our ability to continue scaling our limited release and then transition to full release in the fall. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the US, we are pleased to announce that we expect to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of this year. We are excited to expand our Omnipod 5 offering to reach customers in the US, who have chosen the Libre family of sensors, and we are confident this portfolio expansion will generate increased demand for Omnipod 5, just as we are seeing in the early days of our launches with Libre 2 Plus internationally. Turning to international. In Q2, we extended the Omnipod 5 platform into new markets and we were the first to offer integration with Abbott's Libre 2 Plus sensor internationally, introducing this integrated offering in the UK and Netherlands. This also marked our first sensor of choice Pod offering, which is compatible with both Libre 2 Plus and G6. We are hearing from ACPs and patients that both integrations are providing an outstanding experience, including how easy it is to start Omnipod 5 using either leading sensor. Further expanding global reach, we recently launched Omnipod 5 in France, which is one of our largest markets. We are in the early days and feedback from patients and HCPs has been fantastic. HCPs have noted the very positive clinical outcomes with particular emphasis on Omnipod 5's simplicity. Demand for Omnipod has always been high in France. And with Omnipod 5, we expect to continue to build on this strength and successfully drive robust adoption as we have seen in our other international launch markets. Omnipod 5 is now available to the majority of our European customers. And of course, we are not stopping there. We are in the final planning stages for additional launches in Italy, the Nordics, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Belgium, with others soon to follow. For all of the countries in our near-term pipeline, you will see us begin local market work to prepare for our planned commercial launches throughout 2025. We will keep you updated on our progress, capitalizing on the enormous international opportunity we are pursuing. Turning to type 2 diabetes, which represents another significant opportunity for growth in our business. We are already the market leader in our space. In the second quarter, people with type 2 represented roughly 25% of our US new customer starts, continuing a strong ongoing trend. The type 2 insulin delivery market is large and significantly underpenetrated. The combined patient population using either intensive insulin therapy or basal insulin is roughly three times the size of the type 1 population. This year, we have had two important pathways for innovation in the type 2 space, both commercial and clinical. As you know, we have been commercially piloting Omnipod GO, a product aimed at the needs of basal-only insulin users. The purpose of that pilot has been to accomplish two main goals: one, determine the optimal way to expand our sales force; and two, develop a better understanding of the patient profile that presents in nonspecialist practices so we can better serve patient needs. This pilot has led to our identifying multiple patient profiles and designing our go-to-market strategy. In parallel, we have been pursuing clinical work to expand our offerings for people with type 2 diabetes, most meaningfully with our pivotal trial with Omnipod 5 called SECURE-T2D. We recently presented the trial data at ADA, and I want to take a moment to summarize some of the key top line results. SECURE-T2D is the largest study ever completed for the use of automated insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes, with approximately 300 people completing the protocol. The study participants were highly diverse and representative of the general population in the US. This is important both from the point of view of HealthEquity and because the study results will be clinically relevant to patients as they present in the real world. The clinical outcomes were striking. Omnipod 5 delivered an average A1c reduction of 0.8 with increasing benefit across the study population as baseline A1cs were higher. Those with the baseline A1c greater than 9 on average achieved an A1c reduction of 2.1. More than half of the participants were concurrently on GLP-1 therapy. And notably, results were the same across all cohorts, whether or not on a GLP-1. Importantly, roughly 20% of study participants were currently on basal-only insulin injections, and they also benefited in line with intensive insulin users. In this population, a key barrier to insulin adoption is the risk of hypoglycemia. And in SECURE-T2D, there was no increase in hypoglycemia. Finally, among several other demonstrated benefits, study participants reported a clinically valid and meaningful reduction in diabetes distress. These remarkable results clearly demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefit for people with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of these results, in June, we filed for expansion of our indications use for Omnipod 5 with the FDA. Now that we have such strong results from our clinical trial work and the rich learnings from our Omnipod GO commercial pilot, these two innovation streams will come together. In anticipation of FDA clearance of our label expansion, during the coming quarters, we will make targeted investments in our sales force to extend our currently successful sales model and expand our feet on the street to further penetrate the Omnipod 5 prescribing base, and we will focus our efforts on Omnipod 5. We strongly believe Omnipod 5 will provide benefit to a wide range of insulin using type 2 patients, both those MDI and those on basal-only insane therapy. Therefore, Omnipod 5 will replace Omnipod GO as our offering for people with type 2 diabetes on basal-only insulin. We are grateful for the patients and the HCPs that participated in our pilot and we look forward to supporting them in their transition to other Omnipod therapies. Leading with Omnicon 5 in this space will enable us to serve more customers by leveraging and streamlining existing operations, supply chain and manufacturing, and it eliminates the need for ongoing investments in product life cycle management for a separate product platform. More importantly, we are confident we have a clear right to win in the type 2 space. We expect to be the first to market in type 2 with an AID offering, and not just any AID offering, but with Omnipod 5, which is the product platform that quickly leapfrogged into market leadership once we launched it in type 1. Omnipod 5 will bring all the benefits to type 2 patients that it already delivers, ease of access to the pharmacy channel, low to no upfront cost, market-leading ease of use and the unique discretion and convenience of a wearable, disposable patch pump with the day-to-day simplicity of full phone control with both Android and iOS. All of that, while delivering the striking clinical benefits we have just established with our pivotal trial. We are excited to bring the best automated insulin delivery offer to the type 2 market by the end of this year, pending clearance by the FDA. Ana will have more detail on the financial impact of our refined strategy in a few moments, but the biggest financial impact will be the opening of a new addressable market for us which we fully expect will fuel our growth. Before I hand over to Ana, I'd like to briefly discuss our expanded global manufacturing capabilities. We've been successfully investing in process innovation in our Insulet facility, which is meaningfully contributing to gross margin expansion. And we have made significant investment in the new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Malaysia, which will enable us to scale faster and expand margins and cash flow. We are thrilled to have begun producing sellable Omnipod 5 product in Q2 in Malaysia ahead of schedule. Our new facility is over two times the size of our US facility, and we expect it to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production, ramping as volumes increase. Our advantages and scale position us to grow our global business profitably and seamlessly meet the growing demand for Omnipod 5, which represents an important and distinct advantage over competitors. Shortly after this call, several members of our executive team will travel to Malaysia to attend our facilities official grand opening. We look forward to celebrating this occasion with our local team as well as the many other Insulet employees globally who helped to make this happen. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance. Yes. So, Larry, I know we're actually going to get a lot of clarifying questions on this. I'll just -- let me see if I can characterize it clearly. I'll give it another try. So, we expect sequential growth in the U.S. in new customer starts in Q3 and then again in Q4. And that's consistent with what we've said over the course of the last two quarters, where we expect the second half to be stronger and sequentially stronger two, three, four -- Q2, Q3, Q4 over the course of the year. And the ramp characteristics remain the same. The big tailwind driver for us is G7 and then we have other tailwinds coming. I think that one question that I'm sure people are asking themselves is what does that mean in terms of where we land. And there's two things that have changed in the quarter. One is, as I said, there's a smaller portion of the market overall is competitive switching, although we continue to win clearly in competitive switching. And the other thing is, as we said in the prepared comments, is our G7 launch is going very well through the specialty pharmacy channel and the ramp is good. Demand is good. We're servicing it really well. But we made the decision because of that to not disrupt the customer experience and the channel experience to let inventory flow more naturally into that channel. And so both of those things create a little bit -- I would say, a little bit of a change in our outlook on total new customer starts in the second half. And so as Ana characterized in her comments, we expect a steep ramp, but the ramp in the second half is probably a little bit less steep than we had been expecting before. Now where that lands in terms of total year new customer starts, is hard to characterize each of those -- each of those two dynamics are kind of hard to quantify neither of them is that big. But combined, what we're expecting is a less steep ramp in the second half, but still a really good ramp in the second half in new customer starts in the U.S. Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. I'll take both of those. On international, we're so pleased with Omnipod 5 internationally. It clearly wins wherever we're able to take it. The U.K. launch continues to go extremely well. The Germany launch is going extremely well and off a very strong performance in previous quarters, we -- both of those countries continue to perform ahead of expectation. We've just launched in France. It's very early. France is a really big market for us, but we know we have big demand, and we're rolling that out. We have patients on product and that's beginning to ramp. And then the other launch is, of course, the Netherlands. And -- when we launched the Netherlands, that was our first -- when we entered that country, entered it with our sensor of choice offering, which is G6 and Libre 2, and we took that center of choice offering into the UK, where we were already on market with G6, and that offering is going great. So these are largely MDI growth, driven growth phenomenon in all of those countries. As you know, internationally, most people who are on technology are locked into their contracts. And so it's largely MDI new-to-market customers. Many of them are already on a CGM because CGM paves a road for us, but they're largely new to market pumpers, and we're really, really pleased with the performance, and it makes us very bullish as we continue to roll out Omnipod 5 internationally. On the US dynamic, yes, I mean we're trying to characterize it. It's a little bit odd. We know there's lots of questions about what's going on out there. But you're right, the mix shift is -- that kind of percentage mix shift. That's consistent with what we had last quarter, 85-15. But as we look at the market, what we see as a trend now where just total base of competitive switching out there is smaller. It's a smaller part of the market. It's never been our focus in the business. It's not our focus. Now our focus is market growth. But that 85-15 split is actually not that big a deal. We just want to characterize the dynamic. MDI, we were up in MDI type 1 in the US., up in MDI in type 2, and we very clearly lead in MDI. Although we also win in competitive switching, that's a smaller part of our market and a lower emphasis for us strategically. Travis, It's -- I hope I didn't say it that way. I meant the exact opposite of what you just said, which is we don't want to disrupt customer experience. So what's going on with the specialty pharmacy launch, we've used that kind of specialty pharmacy approach a couple of times in the past, especially as we entered pharmacy. We've actually upgraded the way do it, so with this launch. And with -- this is the first time that we've brought kind of a new compatibility to the Pod into the same channel under the same reimbursement code. And so figuring out how to feather that in and focus our built inventory on new customers has been what we've been designing to do. And we decided to take that into pharma -- into the specialty pharmacies because it allows us to focus on new starts rather than driving a lot of conversion in the base, which doesn't grow our customer base, right? So by taking it through specialty pharmacy, we're focusing on growing our new customer base, which is really important to the business and brings new customers into the market. And as we did that, it wasn't fair to us as we planned it because it was the first time what dynamic would be. The dynamic is great. We're actually really well able to service very strong demand for G7 through specialty pharmacies. And saying that, I should also point out, those specialty pharmacies, the most of them were through multiple pharmacies there through kind of a hub service that we've set up. And most of them are not visible to third-party data. So if people are out there trying to watch our new customer starts, they won't be able to see most of our G7 starts through other reporting mechanisms, for example, like IQVIA. So demand is really good, and it's flowing so well and we can flex it. And so that customer experience has been great. Therefore, we've decided not to force inventory into the retail channel, which would be potentially disruptive both for our channel partners and for customers. So we're going through specialty pharmacy. It's going very well, and we're going to let the inventory transition in retail at a more natural pace. So that's why it's really because of a new customer -- we want to deliver the strongest possible customer experience, and we're happy with how specialty pharmacy is going. So that's on that question. On the first part of your question, year-over-year growth, I think we expect during the second half to cross over into year-over-year growth, it's hard to call exactly when that happens. But the expectation is yes, we get year-over-year growth in the second half. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. The first thing is, yes, I don't want to get too far in front of the FDA on the actual label, but the label we anticipate would allow us to market to both intensive insulin and basal insulin users. So that's the aim. And SECURE-T2D backs that up because 20% of the participants in SECURE-T2D were basal-only users, and they have fantastic results. And so the goal of Omnipod 5 is to get out there and help people who are on insulin who need better control because of the fantastic smart adjust algorithm and its ability to -- as you know, we adjust both basal and adjust for real-time bolus. And so that's the goal. And therefore, if we're able to achieve that labeling, we can help basal-only patients with Omnipod 5. And I know that know that you the initial plan was to start people on Omnipod GO and then as their insulin needs change get them on to Omnipod 5. And the beauty of this strategy is that we don't have to wait to have people going to Omnipod 5. Contingent on FDA labeling, which we expect, and I don't want to get in front of it and all those caveats, we think we can just -- we don't have to wait for Omnipod 5, we just take it to market as Omnipod 5 and meet the needs of a very wide range of patients than we were going to be able to meet. So we're excited about that. And Ana forgotten already the second part of your question. So... Yes, we're really excited about being able to go on to the Omnipod 5 platform as the flagship offer there. I remember your other two components, Mike, so quickly on pricing. We don't anticipate -- I mean, Omnipod 5 is already well covered, well reimbursed for people with Type 2 diabetes. There's -- right now, there's no distinction, and we don't expect big commercial changes on that front. We'll see what happens, but we don't expect any disruption. And then on the other side of that, with the sales force, we've been successfully adding sales force heads now for some time. We added some earlier in the year. We'll continue to add sales force. We'll have more to say about the scale of that and the model for that as we get closer to actual launch. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Internationally, as you know, we're only in 24 markets OUS. And the larger markets are obviously the usual suspects of large markets, UK, Germany, France, Nordics. And so we're in the U. with Omnipod 5 now in Germany with full releases and growing really, really well. France, we're just out of the gate with the Omnipod 5 launch in France. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, Nordics is on the list for coming launches. And then -- and you can -- just by population, I think all the medtech markets are fairly similar in terms of total opportunity. So we feel really good about where we are with Omnipod 5. It's clearly winning where we take it. And as we roll it out, we're very bullish on growth, which is what led us to another 600 basis point increase in guide. Thanks, Mike. In terms of full commercial launch, I mean, what we've done is we've choreographed our plan for the launch in line with what we expect in terms of FDA approval. And so -- we expect FDA approval by the end of the year. And once we have that and with all the other pieces in place in terms of things like sales force training so on, we'll be able to promote in line with that. But we also anticipate, as I said, we'll say more -- we'll give more detail as we get closer to that. We anticipate also expanding our sales reach into nonspecialty channels by adding some feet on the street. And that just gives us more share voice into those markets. And so we'll have more to say about that later. But we do anticipate being able promote as we get clearance. The second side of your question around basal -- thank you. With basal, Omnipod GO product, we were out there looking at how do patients present in the channel. And we saw a number of patient profiles. So we went in with draft patient profile that I won't try to detail. We then -- we added a patient profile to that. And what we found was that there are a lot of patients in the non-specialty channel. There's different patient profiles with type 2 diabetes that need insulin, and there's also a lot of type 1 patients in there. So we're very confident that there's a lot of patients that -- whose needs we can address with Omnipod 5. And if anything, I would say, focusing on to Omnipod 5 makes us even more bullish about our ability to penetrate that market. So we learned a lot as we are in those practices about what's happening in there and which kinds of patients are in there. And we're really excited about taking Omnipod 5 as the flagship product for the patient journey into those channels and to reach those patients. Thanks, Jason, and thanks for the non 15 question list. So that -- so on type 2, yes, we're very confident. I mean, type 2 -- Omnipod 5 right now is reimbursed through the pharmacy benefit. There's not a request for which type of diabetes. It's a script that's written for Omnipod 5, and it's very well covered on that basis, and that's why physicians are writing off label for it. We did see an increase in MDI starts for type 2 patients in the quarter. We don't call out whether that's Omnipod DASH, which has the full indication for user, Omnipod 5. We did see some lift in MDI for type 2. We are not promoting Omnipod 5 for type 2 diabetes because we do yet have the indication for use expansion that will allow us to do that. And our reps, as I've said before, have one arm tied behind their back for that. So we're really bullish on that. But we have seen some lift. And we think the coverage should be final. There shouldn't be any delay in coverage for Omnipod 5 in type 2. Thanks, Matt. On the MDI question. I won't try to probably together any of our competitors' results. I'll just say that I think it's reasonable to think that MDI penetration in type 1 is accelerating, and we're clearly leading that. So Omnipod 5 is very highly preferred with MDI patients. We continue to grow that space and we continue to win with MDI conversions. I think it's durable for both type 1 and type 2. And the reason I believe that is because the burden of living with diabetes remains very high and because our CGM partners have been out paving road very effectively in front of us for some time. And so, we've said before that we think penetration for AID in the type 1 space can go very high, well above 70% on the back of the pave road from CGM, and we're confident that we're going to be the leader that drives that kind of penetration. And we believe that now you see a lot of adoption in type 2 space with CGMs on an ongoing basis. And so our two partners, Abbott and Dexcom, are out there paving road for us in type 2, and we see a big opportunity to take Omnipod 5 likely as the first-to-market AID system in that space, you see a big opportunity to drive the penetration of Omnipod 5 and type 2 as well. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So what we've done, and we've referred to this in the past, as we launch Omnipod 5, we work really hard to make sure that our reimbursement is commensurate with the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates for the health care system and for patients. And so we've been able to, so far, so good, successfully negotiate a premium for Omnipod 5, where we've launched it. And so it is both volume and a bit of a price benefit. And -- but volumes are very, very good, obviously, with -- the starts are very, very strong for us with Omnipod 5 where we've taken it. And then again, I'm forgetting the second half of the... G7, we haven't announced timing. So we're obviously working on it. We have a very effective working G7 integration, which is creating a big tailwind for us in the US, we'll get it into European markets as soon as we can, but we have not yet announced timing. Thanks, Joanne. Yes, we're very happy with our two CGM partners. We have a great relationship with Abbott. We have a great relationship with Dexcom. We're working really well with both of them. We're very excited to announce that we'll be bringing the Libre 2+ integration to the US market by the end of the year. And for us, we have a clear road map for Omnipod 5 platform expansion that includes sensor expansions, and it's full speed ahead. We remain very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 is extremely differentiated from two pumps and will continue to be. And so we're very bullish full speed ahead with both of our partners. Thank you, operator. In closing, we're very pleased with our Q2 and excited about our coming second half. Our cascade of innovation continues with our G7 tailwind, iOS and Libre 2 coming to the US and we're eagerly anticipating TAM expansion with FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 and type 2. Our international business continues to outperform on the strength of Omnipod 5. All of that led us to raise our guide across the board. And none of that would be possible without our amazing global Insulet team who get up every morning to change the lives of people living with diabetes. Thank you, global team. And thanks for joining us, everybody, today. We look forward to updating you next quarter."

            "name": "Ana Maria Chadwick",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We have significant momentum throughout our global business and elivered another strong quarter of financial results strategic execution. Most importantly, our global team continues to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 23% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimated global retention remained stable. The foreign currency impact on total company revenue on a reported basis was approximately 80 basis points favorable versus our reported guidance. US Omnipod revenue growth was 27%, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 is the primary driver of our strong growth, while our integration with G7 is gaining momentum. We are excited to have launched our US full market release with G7 in June, and we will continue to face into our channel partners over the coming months. I will speak more to this dynamic in a few moments. Our year-over-year US revenue growth was primarily driven by our success expanding our customer base and increasing volume throughout the pharmacy channel, including premium Omnipod. This was partially offset by an estimated $10 million reduction of inventory in the channel as we manage the Omnipod 5 G6 to G7 transition, which was in line with our expectations. US utilization trends were slightly lower than prior year as a result of Omnipod 5's significant ramp in the first full year of launch in 2023. As it relates to our US revenue expectations, we estimate approximately half of our beat versus the high end guidance was due to our strong commercial execution. The other half was due to pricing benefits from channel mix as well as fewer G6 pod returns than anticipated. Our underlying growth is strong. We have significant momentum, and we are thrilled to have expanded our product offering and provide greater choice for our customers. With our lead position in the market and the many catalysts for us this year, we are in a great position to continue to deliver robust revenue and customer base growth in 2024 and well beyond. Turning to international. We achieved international Omnipod revenue growth of 24%. These results were once again well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH is doing very internationally and remains a sizable percentage of our overall international volume, Omnipod 5's demand is very high and fueling our growth. Last year's launch in the UK and Germany are driving both revenue and new customer start growth. Although early, the increased demand we're seeing in France as a result of our recent Omnipod 5 launch is very encouraging. Together with our with our rollout of Omnipod 5 Libre 2+ in two of markets around the start of 2Q, we are well positioned for continued growth. International utilization trends were slightly higher than in prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw last year in the US, but to a smaller degree. On a reported basis, foreign currency was 90 basis points headwind over the prior year and approximately 110 basis points favorable versus our guide. Drug delivery revenue was $8 million, which was above our guidance range, partially due to an increase in orders from our partner and timing of production. Gross margin was 67.7%, up 90 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the US pharmacy channel and our international markets, as well as ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting this growth was a onetime charge of $13.5 million, or 280 basis points relating to components that are not expected to be utilized. This charge resulted from our strategic decision to go market with Omnipod 5 instead of Omnipod GO to drive accelerated growth in type 2 pending FDA clearance. Even with this charge, our execution throughout our global business is resulting in significant margin expansion, which strengthens our confidence in our margin trajectory over the long-term as we continue to execute and scale efficiently. While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including to support the cascade of innovations we've had this year and those to come, our level of spend was lower than we expected due to a timing shift into the second half of the year. In order to drive the above-market growth we have been delivering, we will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we are achieving margin expansion resulting from our revenue performance, gross margin improvements and the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. Operating margin was 11.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 18.6% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to our revenue outperformance and the shift in timing of spend. Expansion of these metrics was partially offset by the onetime charge of $13.5 million or 280 basis points related to Omnipod GO. Last quarter, we provided color that due to our positive earnings trend, we may find at some point in the year that the valuation allowance we had against our deferred tax assets may no longer be required. In Q2, we reached this conclusion, and therefore, we released the majority of our valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $150 million in the period, which we adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We expect another $30 million to be recognized during the remainder of the year. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding the full $180 million to be in the range of 20% to 25%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $820 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Last week, we successfully extended the maturity of our Term Loan B to August 2031 and repriced the loan at a lower interest rate, which will reduce cumulative interest expense over the term of the loan by approximately $17 million. Our commitment to drive profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying off, resulting in our ability to expand margins and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 18% to 21%, representing a milestone of $2 billion in annual revenue at the high end of our range. As a result, we also are raising total company revenue growth to a range of 16% 19%. For US Omnipod, we're raising the low end of our revenue guidance and now expect a range of 18% to 21% growth. We expect growth be driven primarily by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the reoccurring revenue stream from our annuity model and growing customer base. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of 2024 versus the prior year period resulting from the estimated orders that were accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 2024. We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half. While we continue to expect sequential growth in new customer starts in both Q3 and Q4, our guidance now contemplates a less steep ramp of new customer starts in the second half of 2024, driven by both the overall market reduction in competitive switching that Jim referred to, and the slightly longer facing period of our G7 Pods through our retail channel partners. While the latter has a temporary impact on new customer starts during the second half, it is simply timing. We are confident this strategy will maximize the customer and HCP experience, which is our top priority, while having the added benefit of limiting returns of the G6 Pod in the channel. Our revenue guidance continues to assume a gradual restocking in the second half of this year as we expand our distribution of G7 Pods throughout all channel partners. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 600 basis points to a range of 18% to 21%. On a reported basis, we now assume there will be no foreign currency impact. We anticipate revenue growth to be driven by the strong momentum from last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. Our 2024 outlook for international business is strengthened every day by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5. Greater-than-expected new customer starts today, as well as revenue outperformance, has resulted in raising our international Omnipod outlook by 1,100 basis points since the start of 2024. Omnipod 5 is gaining traction and taking share. Feedback has been tremendous, and we are clearly a leader with our advanced technology. While we expect our most recent Omnipod 5 launches to contribute new customer starts in the second half of this year, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect them to contribute even more meaningfully to revenue in 2025. Our incredible momentum internationally strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will drive further growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both US and International Omnipod, our guidance factors in quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in the channel for new launches and reducing levels of prior Omnipod generations. Lastly, for drug delivered, our outlook has improved and we now expect a decline in the range of 40% to 50%, reflecting our partner's revised forecast. Turning to 2024 gross margin. Given our strong margin performance in the first half of 2024 and the retirement of some risks we had modeled related to our product launches and new manufacturing facility, we have greater confidence in our full year 2024 outlook. As a result, we now expect to land closer to the high end of our 68% to 69% range, even with the 70 basis points annualized impact from the second quarter Omnipod GO charge. We are in a tremendous position to drive further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to executing our strategy to deliver this growth. We remain committed to driving operating margin expansion as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. Even as we continue to heavily invest in commercial, clinical and R&D to fuel our strong revenue growth trajectory. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14%. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 21% to 24% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, primarily driven by strong demand for Omnipod 5, stronger customer starts and the benefit of our immunity model. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, driven by ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $4 million. In conclusion, our global Insulet team continues to execute and drive strong results. We generated robust new customer starts globally and our cascade of innovation strengthens our position to deliver sustained revenue growth and margin expansion this year and beyond. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Jeff, I'll start with that. Thanks for the question. You are absolutely correct. There are absolutely a lot of puts and takes, especially in the fourth quarter. The important thing to recall here is that our overall guidance for the year continues to be strong, and I know you're referring here specific to the U.S. with that high end of our guidance at that 21%. So, we raised the volume at 18% up to the 21%. I do want to mention something as we think of 2025, which we are not providing guidance during this call. We'll wait until we wrap-up the fourth quarter. We have a lot of things transpiring here, as Jim mentioned in the second half of the year. G7, we have iOS. We have Libre 2 Plus. We have the international that it's really ramping incredibly nicely and more countries ahead and we have the type 2 label extension. Once we have more clarity into the later part of the year, we'll come back and provide that additional guidance. Yes. Let me jump into that. So in the first quarter, we had gross margin of 69.5%, and now we have 67.7%. So that gets us shy of the 69%. And in the second half, we expect to be, as you can imagine, we're guiding to the full 69%. So that's going to be higher than the 69% to make the overall. So that guidance, I just want to be clear, contemplates that contemplates that 70 -- for the full year 70 basis points of pressure, we did not back that out from our guidance. We kept the Omnipod GO charge that we took this quarter in our guidance. So hopefully, helps answer the question. Malaysia has a more limited impact. So as it's starting to produce product. And we expect to get more of that benefit, as we move into 2025 and the first full year of running operations. No, I just wanted to add maybe a comment there. When you think of the implications of that decision, it's not just a short-term impact that we just talked about. There is a much longer-term impact. Jim commented on the customer, commercial, all those things that there's also an operational impact in the company with less product life cycles, simpler in terms of our manufacturing capacity and operational and all those things that come along with that. It's going to have its fruits much longer into the 2025. Sure. I'll start with that one. So when you think of the US, and we are very heavily penetrated now in the pharmacy channel, what we have is we ship product and then we have, of course, the wholesalers, the distributors and the PBMs, and at the end, it's the end customers. So how it moves into, which specific distributors with what relationships, and which PBMs with what coverage. That all is hard to call. And now what we're talking about is not huge dollars, what I described in terms of the impact, but we should have some fluctuation in our pricing as we go through that process. So we will continue to refine our models and just continue to get better and better around that. But it's really a simple dynamic of being now so heavy into the pharmacy channel. Thanks, Matt. So I'll start with your comment on inventory tailwinds. So as we talked about last quarter, we were anticipating a destocking of about $10 million, which we saw happened during the second quarter. And what we anticipate is during the second half of the year that should come back. And the reason it is all around the G6, G7 transition and how we're managing the channel through that process. The G7 International. Great. Let me get started on that. So as we commented, we have really strong gross margin once you back out the impact -- the one-time impact of GO. We have stated before and continue to state Malaysia strategic for us. In the first 12 years, we will be accretive. So at the moment, we're ramping, so that will take time. So you can expect that, that will be accretive right at around that one-year mark and will continue to be. And the other point being the product life cycle. So by taking manufacturing time away from shifting lines and all of those things, we'll anticipate that. We're not providing long-term guidance here. So we'll come back and provide more color after we wrap up here in 2024. I do want to take the opportunity to come back to some of the early questions on new customer starts and clarify just to make sure everybody is on the same page. So new on customer starts, we expect sequential growth, second quarter to third quarter, third quarter to fourth quarter that to be true, US, international, of course, globally. And we already talked about all the reasons why that would happen. The question came up around year-over-year. And I want to also reiterate not only globally because it's obvious that international is working so well, but to a lesser extent, but it's there. Our guidance contemplates year-over-year growth in US NCS. So I just wanted to make sure that that was clarified for everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. \nDeborah Gordon: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. \n Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our first quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. \n Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. \n We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. \n Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Coming out of the 2023 that saw Insulet emerge as the clear industry leader, we entered 2024 with significant momentum. We were off to a great start in Q1, fueled by continuing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our global Insulet team continues to execute at a high level, bolstering our confidence in another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion. Our first quarter revenue results exceeded our expectations for every product line. Given those results and the cascade of innovations that we plan to deliver this year, we have increased our guidance for both top line and operating margin growth. \n On today's call, I want to do 3 things: provide a high-level review of our Q1 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; give an update on our broad innovation agenda for 2024 including our efforts to expand the Omnipod 5 platform and our progress in the type 2 market; and discuss our ongoing efforts to capture the value of scale across our business.\n Starting with financial performance. Our first quarter revenue and margins exceeded our expectations. We achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, including U.S. growth of 23% and international growth of 15%. In the U.S., we continue to build on our clear leadership in the market, and our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was #1 in new customer starts by a wide margin. Demand for Omnipod 5 remains very high, and U.S. new customer starts were robust and in line with our expectations. \n Omnipod 5 is designed to expand the market through its ease of use and easy access, and we continue to succeed in driving market growth. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our new starts came from people previously using multiple daily injections, our target market, and our competitive conversions remained very strong. The Omnipod platform also remains the top choice for people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Type 2 patients represented roughly 25% of our new starts in the quarter. \n Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be when we first brought it to market. This is true in the U.S. and also internationally, where it is dramatically accelerating our growth. Last year's successful launches in the U.K. and Germany continued to exceed our expectations as our teams generate strong new customer starts. In fact, in Q1, more than half of our total international new customer starts were Omnipod 5. \n Given Omnipod 5's early contribution in our European markets, we are raising our international revenue outlook by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. As a result, we now expect total Omnipod growth of 19% at the high end and 18% for total company, representing a milestone of $2 billion in total company revenue. Ana will provide more details on our increased guidance in a few moments. \n Our global results in Q1 make one thing very clear. Omnipod 5 is, without a doubt, highly differentiated and the best offer on the market. Its ease of use, pay-as-you-go economics, affordability and widespread access make it the obvious choice for insulin delivery for people with type 1 diabetes and soon for people with type 2 diabetes once we achieve label expansion. Omnipod 5 leads the market everywhere it goes, and we are not stopping there. \n During Q1, we made significant strides across our innovation portfolio. Because Omnipod 5 is the market leader, it's easy to forget that the current version remains our initial minimum viable product. In 2024, we will expand on the Omnipod 5 platform by bringing new sensor integrations, launching the system in new geographies and extending our phone control offering. \n In the U.S. during Q1, we entered limited market release of our integration with Dexcom's G7 and are on track for full market release this summer, which will allow us to expand choice for customers and capture the opportunity created by the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. In Europe, we successfully entered limited market release of our integration with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor in both the U.K. and the Netherlands, ahead of our midyear launch plans. \n This release represents 2 firsts. Omnipod 5 is the first AID system to offer integration with the Libre 2 sensor in Europe, which is Abbott's most widely adopted CGM. And Omnipod 5 in the Netherlands represents our first sensor of choice pod offering. These pods are compatible with both Abbott's Libre 2 Plus and Dexcom's G6 sensor. Early results from the U.K. and the Netherlands are extremely promising, and we look forward to providing future updates with regard to the timing of full market release. \n Staying in Europe, we are pleased to announce that we now plan to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in France also this summer. France has historically been one of our largest markets and one in which we know demand for our solutions is high. When we first launched Omnipod DASH in this market, it quickly became the insulin pump brand of choice, and we are confident in our ability to drive strong adoption with our advanced AID system. With the launch in France, we will achieve our stated goal of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers and reach this milestone ahead of our internal end-of-year expectations. \n We anticipate our recent Omnipod 5 international launches will fuel accelerated new customer starts in the second half of this year and revenue growth next year and beyond. We also plan to enter our U.S. limited market release for our iOS app this summer. Extending Omnipod 5 onto the iPhone platform is one of our most frequently requested features, and we are excited to bring this offer to market. \n Turning to the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, where we remain the U.S. market leader in this large and underserved patient population. The commercial pilot with Omnipod GO, our FDA-cleared offering for the over 3 million people in the U.S. who need daily basal-only insulin, continues to offer significant learnings. Because of our pilot efforts, we have developed a better understanding of this market, and we have expanded the definition of targeted patient segments. We now also have even greater confidence that we will be able to bring our innovative technology to a broader range of HCP and physician practices. We are refining our plans for extended commercial reach based on those learnings. \n We also know that there is significant current demand for solutions that support intensive insulin use for people with type 2 diabetes. In this market, Omnipod DASH continues to perform extremely well driven by its ease of use and accessibility. In that context, we are very excited about the progress we are making towards achieving FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 for type 2.\n During Q1, we reached a key milestone in our SECURE-T2D pivotal trial with the last patient completing the protocol. We are well on track to meet our goal of submitting to the FDA for label expansion by the end of the year. Once cleared, we expect to meaningfully accelerate Omnipod 5 adoption among the approximate 2.5 million people with insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes. And we will have the broadest offering of insulin delivery technology solutions on the market for this important patient population. \n Lastly, we continue to analyze the market impact of GLP-1 use. Analysis of actual claims data demonstrates that GLP-1 use accelerates the adoption of insulin among people living with type 2 diabetes. The data are definitive and striking and strengthen our conviction in the size of the unmet need and the size of the business opportunity for our growing type 2 portfolio. We are finalizing our analysis and look forward to providing a more detailed update soon. \n 2024 is shaping up as we planned to be a year filled with a cascade of innovations that will allow us to build on our position and market leadership, and we will take advantage of those innovations because of our expanding scale. Our business continues to enjoy several advantages that we've achieved through commercial scope and operational scale. \n First, our products have very broad reimbursement with more than 95% of covered lives in the U.S. for both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH. And through our nationwide distribution reach, Omnipod is available at retail pharmacies that are within 5 miles of over 85% of the U.S. population. \n Our strategy to increase awareness of Omnipod with endocrinologists and primary care physicians has resulted in an expanded base of health care providers writing scripts for our products, fueling our leadership position. In the U.S., in Q1, the number of U.S. Omnipod 5 prescribing HCPs grew to over 20,000, up from over 18,500 the prior quarter. These prescribers were endocrinologists, PCPs and other HCPs, and the split was approximately 1/3 each. And the prescribers span both the type 1 and type 2 markets, and both increased substantially year-over-year. \n In order to fuel our growth, we are further expanding our commercial reach. Internationally, we continue to prudently invest in our commercial expansion and in our market access capabilities. In the U.S., we are in the process of incrementally expanding our sales force, including the creation of new territories and expansion into targeted pediatric centers. Our broad sales, marketing and channel capabilities allow us to reach a large and growing population of patients and represent a growing set of advantages over aspiring competitors.\n Lastly, we also enjoyed significant financial benefits from our scaled manufacturing. Insulet has been on a 20-year journey of capability building and continuous improvement, which has allowed us to build world-class capabilities to drive ongoing quality and productivity. Manufacturing scale and scope have been big drivers of our gross margin expansion over that time, and we expect our new Malaysia facility will fuel continued efficiency gains. \n We are in the final stages of validating our manufacturing lines in Malaysia and expect to begin producing salable product in Q3. The facility represents a sizable investment of approximately $200 million over the course of 4 years through 2026, provides approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and is expected to house more than 1,000 full-time employees at full capacity.\n Our regional sourcing strategy includes using local suppliers for components contributing to resiliency and improved costs. This facility will also strengthen our global operational capabilities, drive increased capacity to meet our robust demand and support future international market expansion. We expect our Malaysia site to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production ramping over time. It represents one of the many opportunities we have to lower total landed product costs and expand margins over the near and long term.\n Our advantages in scope and scale put Insulet in a strong position to continue to invest in the growth of our business and to expand our margins. This is yet another way in which our business is unique among our direct competitors. \n With that, I'll introduce Ana, who is joining us for her first call as our CFO. As you will have seen in our announcement, Ana is a highly accomplished and proven leader. We are thrilled to have her join the Insulet team, and I'm personally looking forward to benefiting from her partnership as we execute our strategy to drive rapid growth and strengthen our financial profile. Over to you, Ana. \nAna Chadwick: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the first quarter financial results, I want to say how excited I am to be part of this outstanding company. Insulet is transforming diabetes management and improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people while driving strong financial performance. I am confident that we're just getting started, especially with the exciting developments in our pipeline. \n I look forward to partnering with Jim, our skilled leadership and the rest of Insulet's talented global team to advance our mission for our customers while also delivering robust revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value. And above all else, I look forward to helping make a positive impact on people around the world with diabetes. \n Now on to our first quarter results. First quarter exceeded our expectations, and we generated strong global new customer starts. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 23% revenue growth driven by global Omnipod growth of 21%, and our estimated global retention and utilization trends remain stable. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind for our total revenue on a reported basis compared to first quarter last year. \n U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 23%, driven by robust growth on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes customer bases as well as expanding volume through the pharmacy channel. Adoption of Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 continues to be the driving force, and we are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release with G7, which we expect will accelerate new customer starts in the second half of this year, following our planned full market release this summer. \n Our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5 success and robust demand. With many catalysts ahead of us this year, we're laying the foundation for sustained revenue growth for 2024 and beyond. \n International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, which was well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH remains the largest percentage of our overall international volume, last year's Omnipod 5 launches in both the U.K. and Germany continue to drive notable increases in new customer starts and were the primary drivers of our accelerated growth. \n On a reported basis, foreign currency was 210 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 110 points favorable versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 69.5%, up 230 basis points on a reported basis and up 460 basis points compared to prior year adjusted gross margin. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our internal expectations, was primarily due to volume growth in the U.S. pharmacy channel with a premium on the pods as well as our International Omnipod revenue performance and improved manufacturing efficiencies.\n While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including multiple product launches globally, the timing of some expected spend shifted into the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest to drive above-market growth while remaining committed to expanding operating margins through improvements in gross margin as well as efficiencies throughout our global business. \n Operating margin was 12.9%, and adjusted EBITDA was 20.2% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin as well as timing of spend.\n Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $750 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. As anticipated, our increased efforts to drive profitable growth are translating into expanding margins and a stronger overall financial profile.\n Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we're raising expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 15% to 19% and total company revenue growth to a range of 14% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance and now expect a range of 17% to 21% revenue growth. We expect growth to be driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption, which provides the benefits of reoccurring revenue stream due to our annuity model. \n We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half of 2024, consistent with normal historical seasonality trends. Additionally, our planned U.S. full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 this summer is expected to contribute to the acceleration of new customer starts in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to accelerate new customer starts this year, which we expect will drive further revenue growth next year and beyond. \n We have massive market opportunities not only from further type 1 MDI penetration but also as we continue to penetrate the type 2 market. We are building a type 2 product portfolio and are excited to have this be one of our accelerated growth drivers over the near and long term. \n For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. We expect growth to be driven by last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. \n The substantial rate in our international revenue outlook reflects the outperformance of new customer starts and revenue since we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany, and to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. We originally expected revenue growth in the first half of the year to be in the high single digits. With our revised outlook, we now expect first half growth of 13% to 15% and similar second half year-over-year growth profile, also up from prior expectations. \n We expect our recent Omnipod 5 launches in 1Q to contribute to new customer starts in the second half of the year and given the nature of our annuity model to more meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth in 2025. We have strong momentum internationally, and we are confident that Omnipod 5 will drive growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. \n For both the U.S. and International Omnipod, we expect quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in channels for new launches and reducing levels for prior Omnipod generations. We do not expect this to materially impact our full year outlook. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our expectations of a 50% to 60% decline. \n Turning to 2024 gross margin. We are reaffirming a range of 68% to 69%, closer to the midpoint of the range. While we have a number of opportunities that could result in further gross margin expansion this year, we want to be prudent with our expectations given risks that come with significant product launches and standing up a new manufacturing facility. We are in a fantastic position to continue driving further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to doing so. \n We also have an increased commitment to drive operating margin expansion. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D, clinical and our commercial launches, we now expect to drive some operating leverage as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. As a result, we are raising our operating margin expectations to approximately 13.5%, up 50 basis points from our original expectations. \n Although we don't guide to our effective tax rate, I will provide color since our income continues to grow. Our first quarter effective tax rate almost doubled to approximately 6% due to changes in income distribution among our jurisdictions. Given the positive trend in our earnings, we may reach a point this year where we conclude that the valuation allowance we have against our net deferred tax assets is no longer needed. We estimate this would result in a $200 million noncash reduction of income tax expense in the period the release is recorded, which we would adjust out for non-GAAP purposes. Subsequently, our effective tax rate may increase to an estimated annualized operational run rate of approximately 20% for the near term.\n Turning to our second quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 18% to 21% and total company growth of 15% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%. Growth drivers include the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, bringing with it the advantages of U.S. pharmacy channel, continued strong new customer starts and the benefits of our annuity model. With our new customer starts momentum, we expect sequential growth in second quarter, partially offset by wholesalers taking down G6 pod inventory as we begin to ramp G7 pods. And we expect to see some meaningful second half sequential dollar growth for the many catalysts we discussed.\n For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 12% to 15%, driven by the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5 in our initial markets, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we expect an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 200 basis points. Finally, we expect Q2 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $4 million to $5 million.\n In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect continued successful execution of our strategy as well as robust new customer starts in both our U.S. and international markets. In my first few weeks at Insulet, I have been incredibly impressed with what the company continues to accomplish, and I am even more energized by the incredible opportunities that lie ahead, which are greater than I had envisioned before joining. We are well positioned and remain committed to delivering sustained revenue growth and margin expansion for the balance of this year and well beyond. \n With that, operator, please open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Margaret Kaczor Andrew with William Blair. \nMargaret Kaczor: Maybe just to start with kind of a big picture question. 2024 certainly seems like a year probably as active as you guys have been with new launches with an eye maybe towards 2025 acceleration in revenues as the new patient starts to accelerate in the back half of this year. So one, I guess, is that how you guys are thinking about it? And then two, is it too forward to think that as new patients start to accelerate in the back half, those can add a step change in new start growth? Or is it going to be more of a steady acceleration as you launch all of these different initiatives in the back half of this year? \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Margaret. Great question. We think that the timing of the product launches is really critical to ramping over the course of the year in '24. And so that's why we're really excited to be in LMR and be able to say that we anticipate full release of G7 in the U.S. over the summer and to already be in LMR going really well with our sensor of choice offering with -- including the Libre 2 Plus in Europe. And we do think that both new customer starts continue to accelerate over the course of the year and revenue continues to accelerate, and we'll see the revenue results more strongly in the second half. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice quarter. Wanted to ask on what you're seeing competitively in the market, both in type 1 and type 2. Type 2 starts were particularly strong. It sounded like new patient growth wasn't a record but was still very robust, and I think it was expected to be below record given no G7 integration yet or Apple. But would love to hear how you feel you're doing competitively in terms of new patient share and any competitive switching? And also, if I could just tack on. I heard there was destocking in the second quarter. Was there any stocking or destocking in the first quarter? And how do we think about the dollar impact in the second quarter in the U.S.? \nJames Hollingshead: I think there's a bunch of things. And let me start with the stocking question and then come back to the competitive question. So stocking, we're only ever going to call that out if there's something unusual. And channel -- the stock in the channel is back to normal. We don't see anything unusual happening, and we're not going to talk about that unless we ever see something change that we think changes the trend or whatever. So that dynamic is totally ordinary in the quarter. \n So on the competitive position, we feel really strong about our competitive position. We're very, very confident in our competitive position. New customer starts in the first quarter in the U.S. came in right in line with our expectations, and obviously, in Europe did really, really well, which led us to raise our guide. \n And I think competitively -- give me an opportunity to just say a little bit about how we see the dynamic, which I'll try to be concise with. In the U.S. in type 1, the bulk of the market is still on MDI, as you all know. So we estimate that, as we've said before, 40% of type 1 patients in the U.S. are using some sort of pump technology and 60% are not. Our offering in Omnipod 5 has been designed to convert people off of MDI onto our technology because it's so simple to use, simple to put on, simple to use, simple to stay on, easy to access, great economics and great clinical outcomes. \n And so that's why we always say MDI is our target market. And from a competitive positioning point of view, we win that battle very, very handily. We clearly lead the market in MDI. And it's really Omnipod 5 that's growing in the market in type 1 for technology because we have such a clear leadership position there. In the remaining 40% that's penetrated, you do see there's a portion of that market which does have some competitive switching. \n And what we see over and over again and again in this quarter is that we have the net winners in the competitive switching game, and that's a smaller part of the market to begin with. And then it's only a fraction of that market that's up for conversion at any given time because of the 4-year lock-in on the tubed pumps. But we are clearly the net winners in any kind of competitive switching dynamics. \n So in sum, we lead in type 1, clearly. We lead in type 2, clearly. We lead very clearly in MDI, and we win the competitive switching game in the installed base. And so we feel very confident. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. And we see that over and over again. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. \nJeffrey Johnson: Jim, maybe we can stay on that type 2 point, so forgive me if you've already talked about this, and I think put a good focus on it. But we've seen the ATTD data that suggests GLP-1s might bring heavy insulin users back down into that like 60, 65 unit a day range where you can put them on a pump. We know you guys have shown some strong real-world data on T2 time in range. So some of your competitors. So it sounds like the KOLs are starting to push more and more for getting these type 2 intensives on AIDs as well. And you guys especially have been investing in the primary care channel where I think a lot of that T2 care is delivered. \n So how close are we getting to the precipice of kind of this inflection in type 2 uptake? And I know it's been going up in your numbers the last few quarters. We can see that. But it seems like we're still maybe not there but getting real close to an inflection not just for the market but maybe your competitive positioning in there with O5 as well. \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Jeff. Great question. We are really excited about the opportunity for AID in the type 2 market. And as we know, we're already the clear leader in that market with Omnipod DASH. So in the pump market with Omnipod DASH, very clear leader. And you all know we don't promote Omnipod 5 because we don't have the label. So we don't promote Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market. But it gets written off label fairly frequently, as you can kind of reverse engineer out of our numbers. \n That's why we're so excited to be getting so close to filing with the FDA for a label extension. Because right now, we're out in the market with one arm tied behind our back. And we have a very firm conviction that as we get that label extension, we'll be able to drive dramatic growth in the use of Omnipod 5 specific -- not just AID obviously but Omnipod 5 specifically in that market. \n So we're getting very close. As we said about the pivotal trial, we've not just completed enrollment, but we have last patient through the trial. So we're in the process of gathering, cleaning, the normal steps of pivotal. We're gathering, cleaning the data. We're preparing our FDA filing. We're well on track to file. We've given guidance that we will file by the end of the year. We are very well on track to do that. And based upon what we've seen from our competitors, we're clearly out in front of everybody else in that market. \n But also remember, Omnipod 5, the offering itself is going to be -- it has a very clear right to win in the type 2 space because of its ease of use, its discretion, its availability in the pharmacy channel, its great outcomes, which we'll demonstrate further with data in type 2. So we are very, very bullish on the type 2 market. It continues to be a very clear unmet need, and we feel like we have what will be the best offering in the market. And we'll probably be there first. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. \nMichael Polark: Maybe a quick follow-up on type 2 there. Is it the expectation that we'll see data from the SECURE trial at ADA? \nJames Hollingshead: Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. It's our intent to show data from the STeP trial at ADA and with a specific focus on showing the subset analysis of people who are on GLP-1s in that data. Yes. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: I wanted to follow up on the Q2 guidance. It looks like the guidance you gave is sequentially down, but you said in the prepared remarks you expect sequential growth in the second quarter offset by the wholesalers taking down the G6 inventory. And curious if you could help quantify what that guide assumes for the impact of the G6 inventory piece so we can kind of get the underlying Q2 guidance. \nAna Chadwick: Travis, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. I think the main point here is to take a step back, and as you look at the U.S., we not only reaffirmed our full year guidance. We actually are taking up the low end. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we have all these cascade of new product launches, both in the U.S. and international, we're making assumptions. And as we do that, the key here is to remember that we believe the second half will be greater growth than the first, but we continue to expect the growth. And I think to call the exact timing is we're giving our best estimate. But the key important thing is that we're raising overall guidance for revenue, including international and the low end in the U.S. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Jim, I wanted to circle back on new patient starts in the U.S. I heard robust U.S. type 1 and type 2 new starts in Ana's prepared remarks. Were new patients starts up year-over-year in Q1 in the U.S.? And do you still expect new starts to grow year-over-year in 2024? And talk about why you see G7 as a driver of new starts growth in the second half of the year. \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Larry. Year-over-year in Q1, overall new starts were not up, but MDI was up for us. So that gives you a sense of our strength in bringing customers out of MDI into the market. We expect sequential growth over the course of the year in new customer starts in the U.S. As I said before, I expect a record for us in the U.S. and globally in NCS for 2024. And what was the last part of your question, Larry? \nLarry Biegelsen: Just conceptually understand why G7 integration is a driver of that new start growth. \nJames Hollingshead: Thank you very much. So G7 will be a tailwind for us once we get to full market release because of the nature of prescriptions, new customer prescriptions for CGM in the U.S. market. So I know you all look at this. But if you go look at new customer scripts for CGM, G7 has overtaken G6. And so you guys have always used -- heard me use this metaphor of fishing in a stocked pond. We've done obviously very, very well fishing in the G6 pond and have led the new starts with G6. \n And in the quarter, I think you can see from our new customer starts, it has not been a headwind for us to have the G7 out of the market and be so well adopted because what we found -- and with new customer starts right in line with our expectation, what we found is that if people want to be on Omnipod 5, they'll stay on the G6 or if they want to start AID on Omnipod 5, they go get a G6. So that hasn't been a headwind. \n But G7 will be a tailwind because there are more and more patients out there on a G7. And as we've said all along on the Omnipod 5 ride since we've launched, the CGM -- our CGM partners pave road for us. And so DexCom is now paving the road with G7. We need to get a car on that road, right? So that's why the timing of G7 launch is really important to us, and we want to get on market with it with full release as quickly as we can. And that's why we believe G7 will be a tailwind in the second half and will drive more new customer starts in the second half because we'll add G7 to the portfolio. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. \nPatrick Wood: You guys have mentioned a few times learnings in type 2 and that side of things. And so I guess my basic question is -- and I know you've been investing there, and you've just upped the guide on the margin side of things. But these are very different patients, and PCPs are very different and require a different amount of training. As we ramp through the back half of this year and into next year, do you think there's like an investment cycle again needed from you guys in driving that type 2 market, particularly on the service and sort of support side? \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Patrick. It's a great question. That's part of the purpose of the commercial pilot, is to get out in the real world and see how those practices operate because historically, our call point has been endocrinology practices. And so we're out calling on primary care and specifically on primary care who, when you look at their scripting behavior overall with things like CGM and insulin, look more like endo practices than like true general practices, right? And so we've been out in the world calling on those practices to see how they manage patients, how they manage diabetes therapy. And we've learned a lot. \n And what we want to do out of that learning, coupled with the portfolio that we'll bring to market, is to figure out this -- kind of the term of the right selling motion. So that will include what's the right sales rep design, so the role description for that sales rep, what's the right support. Right now, we have quoted reps paired up with clinical service manager reps, who do both. Does that mix of rep look the same? Is it different? What's the reach? What's the so-called share of voice and design and commercial model? \n I think the reason we're so bullish on what we've learned out of the pilot is, first of all, as we've said in the past, Omnipod as a platform is so simple to use that often the phenomenon is when we walk into those practices and say, \"We're here to talk about an insulin pump,\" their first reaction is we don't do insulin pumps because they're too complicated. And then we show them Omnipod GO, and they say, \"Wait a minute. That's an insulin pump.\" And it's so simple to use that it leads to a more holistic conversation about insulin delivery. And often then they start to ask about basal/bolus solutions, which then leads us to talk about DASH. \n And so one of the key learnings is we think in those practices, there's an opportunity not just for Omnipod GO but ultimately for Omnipod 5 in intensive insulin therapy. And the other thing I think we're finding is that there's a range of patients out there. So I think the kind of stereotypical view is that type 1 patients are treated in endocrinology and type 2 -- a lot of type 2 patients are treated in general practice. But we're actually finding there's both in both. \n And so a lot of the intensive user -- intensive insulin using type 2 patients already in endocrinology, but we also see them in primary care. And we see actually a surprising number of type 1 patients being treated in primary care as well. So we think the opportunity there is different and more promising than when we initially launched the pilot, and we will be making a determination about the commercial model. And then in direct answer to your question, there probably will be some more investment in sales and support to capture it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: I guess I was wondering if you could comment on pump market growth just with all the enhancements going on with integrations and technologies across the space. Can you comment on whether you think the market growth is accelerating or you think it will accelerate in the coming quarters or next year? \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Matt. We think that you can see the normal cyclicality in the market, but the market is growing, first. And there's 2 drivers of market growth. The first one is the widespread adoption of CGM. And the second big driver of market growth is Omnipod 5 because it makes it so simple to come on to AID. And so as we continue to lead in MDI with a very clear leadership in the MDI position, those MDI patients are market growth for AID, and we are leading the way there. So the technology itself is driving market growth, and our CGM partners are doing it, and we're leading the way in AID. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. \nPhillip Dantoin: This is Phil on for Matt. And just to circle back to Travis' question from before because I'm not sure that was explicitly clear as it relates to Q2. For total Omnipod, can you confirm that Q2 growth will be sequentially up if you back out this wholesaler dynamic? And then just for some who are listening who might not be familiar, can you talk about the fact that G6 pods are different than G7 pods? \nJames Hollingshead: Let me start on the pods, and then I'll ask Ana to comment, go back to the Q2 financials. So the G6, G7 pods, when we get to full release of -- for the G7 integration. Those will be backwards compatible pods. So the current pods only -- can only connect with G6. But when we launch G7, the G7 pods will be G7 and G6 pods and be backwards compatible. So what that will mean for a customer or a user is that if they want to stay on the G6, they'll be able to stay on the G6 because the pods will work with it, but it will also accept G7. And so it will be kind of a sensor of choice within the Dexcom family of CGM. Ana, do you want to take the... \nAna Chadwick: Sure. Listen, I'll take another stab at here the 2Q guidance. And I just -- once again, I want to put it in overall perspective for the year. We're taking up our guidance in the U.S., even in the low end. And we expect overall that sequential growth to be there, as I stated. And I think the key point to mention here is we made our best assumption here as we have this transition of product out in the market. And we called our best estimate, and we will update as we progress through the year. But we feel very confident over the entire calendar year with the guide we've given. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: I guess I have a question on international. I think you mentioned that first and second half growth would be in the, I think you said, 13% to 15% range. Just given the annuity model, given the new products, geographies, why wouldn't second half growth be higher than first half? \nAna Chadwick: Thank you for the question. Listen, as I mentioned here, we took the entire guidance up 500 basis points, and that's given what Jim referred to. I mean the adoption we're seeing on Omnipod 5 is phenomenal and great. We're going to be in more markets as well. And the markets -- all of these European markets have slightly different dynamics. Some of them are in 4-year cycles, so on and so forth. \n So we feel good with the guidance that we're giving. And in anything that's new, our goal and the philosophy of this team and my philosophy is we want to give you numbers that we could hit. We definitely don't want to miss. So that's kind of the philosophy in which the spirit -- and we felt the 500 basis point guide up was significant. We will learn a lot more as we go through the next few months and as we learn more of these launches, and we will update accordingly. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co. \nSteven Lichtman: So yes, just building on that last question, you've given the annuity model. Really nice to see this near-term outperformance. And assuming it's led by steeper ramp in new starts, are there any new start metrics you can provide from outside of the U.S.? And are you getting a higher price point for O5 outside of the U.S., so this is a mix opportunity as well? \nJames Hollingshead: Sure. We don't -- as you know, Steve, we don't give guidance on actual numbers and so on. But we did try to allude, I think, in the prepared remarks to the fact that Omnipod 5 is out of the gate so strong in the U.K. and Germany that already in Europe, more than half of our new customer starts are Omnipod 5. So that will give you some color on the strength of the adoption. We'll launch in France over the summer. And then the France -- we're in Netherlands in LMR, and we'll get to FMR in the Netherlands, and then we'll launch in France over the summer. And there's a ramp, as you all know, to the dynamic. \n And so that's how you should expect to see it. If we ramp in those countries the way we are, we'll see a revenue impact. And depending on how quickly we can get France actually launched, which will happen -- we've given summer as kind of a range. That will have more or less effect within the year. But we expect to have great adoption in France because Omnipod DASH has been so successful and it's so demanded by patients. So just to give you a color on kind of the starts dynamic for us. \n In terms of ASP, yes, we've been very successful in negotiating for a premium on Omnipod 5 relative to Omnipod DASH in our European markets. That's different from what we did in the U.S., as you know, where we launched Omnipod 5 effectively at price parity. But in Europe, we want to take advantage of the fact that Omnipod 5 is new technology, and that's been an important component of each individual country launches to go in and negotiate for reimbursement that's more commensurate with the value, the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so there is a mix impact on revenue as we get Omnipod 5 into each of those markets. It's a little -- the actual premium itself is a little different by market. But so far, we've been very successful in securing a premium for Omnipod 5. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I have 2. And the first one is I want to make sure I have an idea of what to expect when Libre 2 is integrated with Omnipod 5 and how you think about launching that and uptake. And then the second one is in addition to the type 2 clinical data at ADA, what else should we be looking for? \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Joanne. Libre 2, we're very excited. As you can imagine, we're very excited to get our Libre 2 integration into market in LMR. So far, we're having great results with the patient experience in both the U.K. and the Netherlands. And as you know, the Libre 2 form factor, that sensor for our partner, Abbott, is their most adopted sensor. And so it opens up an entirely new kind of side to the market for us, kind of serviceable addressable market, if you want to think in those terms of all of those Libre 2 users who may, therefore, also want to go on to an AID system in Omnipod 5. And Omnipod 5 is so simple to use, and the form factor is so great that we think it will have very high appeal to that Libre 2 user population. So we're very, very excited to get it out to market. Great to see the early results. \n Turning to GLP-1 and ADA data. There will be other things we'll show at ADA. We're going to show -- we'll show some subset analysis out of our pivotal trial. I'm sure we'll show an update on our real-world evidence, which has consistently shown that we deliver fantastic time in range, along with very low hypoglycemia in increasingly large populations of real-world data sets, and we'll have some other studies that we haven't yet discussed. No later than ADA, you should see us report an update on our analysis of GLP-1, which I alluded to briefly in our prepared comments. Because it's in real claims data, you can see that people who adopt GLP-1s are more likely to adopt insulin in the same year. And so we'll be documenting that with the robust presentation of the claims data, which is very exciting. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a great start to the year. Just a quick question on the new patient starts from competitive switches. Jim, I know you guys talked last quarter about the fact that one of your competitors was holding on to their installed base a little bit more. Just curious what you -- has that gotten worse? You have another competitive launch happening. Wondering if they're also holding a little bit tighter to their installed base. And how do you see this evolving? Is this something that we should be thinking an 85-15 MDI competitive switch split? And I appreciate that MDI is the key to the growth story, but just curious about what you're... \nJames Hollingshead: Yes, it's a great question, Danielle. The first thing I would say just quickly is, on the 85-15, that was actually a pretty subtle shift in mix. That is a mix percentage, and it was fairly subtle. And we tend to give you guys -- we have an estimation on that. We don't have perfect insight into those mix data that we give on MDI versus competitive T1, T2. There's kind of an estimation range in those. And so I wouldn't over-index on the modeling in what we reported. It was a pretty subtle shift. \n Having said that, what we see -- I can't really speak to the challenges our competitors face in retaining the customers in their installed bases. What we see consistently both with our own proprietary market research, which we put in place in the last few quarters, and also with third-party data is that we are the clear net winners in the competitive switch game. So if you're a manufacturer, you can typically get a sense of how many customers you're converting from, from a competitor. But you don't often have great insight into what your loss rate is. \n And so we put in place a market analysis that allows us to better estimate that. And it's a very consistent dynamic for us since we launched Omnipod 5 that we are the net winners in that game. So we gain way more customers than we lose, both head-to-head with our competitors and then obviously overall in the market. And so that just speaks to how strong our competitive position is with Omnipod 5. It's clearly the best offer on the market, and that's what the market says with those results. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. \nWilliam Plovanic: Just really wanted to go back to type 2 and Omnipod GO, and I don't know if I missed this. Did you give any detail on timing for full market release? And if not, are you kind of waiting for the O5 to be available before you roll out so you have a full product set? And then with the ATTD data with time in range on the AID, I was wondering if some of this data has been driving kind of a shift in the market there as well. \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Bill. We haven't given timing on Omnipod GO. And obviously, we haven't yet filed Omnipod 5. And so the commercial pilot is intended to make sure that we have enough learning in place to put the right commercial model in place. And we'll figure out exactly how we'll bring the portfolio. So we have not updated on timing for Omnipod GO, but you can -- I think you can easily envision that with a portfolio of products, the commercial model looks different than with a single product, right? So I'll put it that way, I think. \n With the ATTD data, to me, the real-world evidence that we were able to show makes it really clear that the Omnipod 5 algorithm is a world-class algorithm. It produces fantastic results, clinical results. It produces it across age groups, across demographics. And as we've said before, one of the things that's unique about our real-world evidence is that it's from all comers. And so it's not only from highly engaged patients who upload their data. It's from all patients who are on Omnipod 5. And so when it has robust results, you can sort of see it as extra robust because it's a clear view into every corner of the user population. \n And on top of that, what it shows is we produce great time in range, as I said, but we continue to have very low hypoglycemia in our algorithm, which is a big competitive advantage for us. So that data is helping us now out in the field as we talk to physicians and continue to introduce Omnipod 5 to new users to demonstrate just how clinically effective Omnipod 5 is on top of and in addition to its great ease of use. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. \nMarie Thibault: I'll move away from the top line here and focus on margins. You had excellent operating margin again this quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the near-term cadence. Saw that you raised the guidance but also heard that you're expecting some incremental expansion of the sales force. So just any guidance on a quarterly cadence on that metric. \nAna Chadwick: Yes, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. We're in a really strong position as we look at our operating margin. And I'll break it down. From a gross margin perspective, we did that 69.5%. That's very strong. We look to have strength on that as we progress through the year. Now from an operating perspective, what we need to balance out here is the investments because we want to really position ourselves into the future. And as Jim and I have talked, it is kind of a good problem to have. And we have a cadence around analyzing our investments and making sure there's that rigor of those returns. \n So as we sit here, yes, we see upward mobility here in our margins. And at the same time, we want to be prudent in our capital allocation to continue to fuel the growth, and as you mentioned here, the sales force and the different investments in our product and product features and other things. So it's a real balance, and we will continue to drive margins up as our priority and continue to prioritize our investments. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron. \nChristopher Pasquale: Jim, I wanted to understand your GLP-1 comment better. The thesis around GLP-1 use in type 2 is that it would help those patients take a couple of steps back on the disease progression escalator, if you will. So maybe the insulin use can be delayed, or if they're already on insulin, they can use less. And now you're talking about the transition to insulin use actually being accelerated. So do you think being on a GLP-1 is really making them more likely to need insulin? Or is what you're picking up there just that these patients were not engaging with their disease previously and now they are and GLP-1s are the catalyst to get them more active? \nJames Hollingshead: Yes. Great question, Chris. Yes, obviously, we'd be speculating. So just to -- and we'll be publishing an update that we'll give you one more detail. So I don't want to steal the thunder of what we'll put out. So you can also look at the slides, and we can have a better conversation about it. But I'd just say we'd have to speculate what's actually happening. It's -- the analysis is based on claims data. And so it's very robust. It's very large end claims data. And what it shows is that for those patients who adopt GLP-1, they are much more likely to also adopt insulin in the same year. \n And given what we see -- and so I'm not going to speculate just for a second, okay? Given what we see with GLP-1s, we know GLP-1s lower A1c. So I think the dynamic is more likely the second -- your second suggestion, which is patients go in, they get put on a GLP-1 because their A1cs are really high. And then either they drop off of the GLP-1, which we'll also have some information on that in our deck, or they stay on GLP-1, but they haven't resolved their A1c issue. And therefore, they also go on insulin. And so that's what we see in the claims data, but we can assert out of the claims data what's actually happening in the clinic. And I'm sure it's different for every patient. But at the population level, that's the very clear and striking dynamic. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. \nBrett Gasaway: This is Brett on for Mike. Just wanted to go back to the guide, I guess, on the high and the low end in particular. What are some of the assumptions in terms of just the G7 launch like? Does it take a certain time in the summer that that's going to launch to hit the high end of the guide or the midpoint of the guide? Or is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of timing there? And then with that, just overall attrition and then the timing of the France launch as well, if there's any swing factors there in the OUS guide. \nAna Chadwick: All right. There's a few questions here, and maybe we'll tag team here between Jim and I. Let me take the guide first. Listen, it goes back to the fundamental. First and foremost, we're increasing our revenue guide. Second point in terms of timing, we are absolutely assuming that as we put the new G7 pods into our channels, there's going to be a reduction of the G6 as it gets sold through the channel. So there is a destocking of that G6, and we have an assumption there, I'll call it, roughly in the $10 million or so. \n Now the timing of all of this is really hard to call. That's why as I get the question asked, I keep bringing everybody back up to the full year, the second half of the year. But that, I just wanted to clarify because it's been asked a few times, and that's really our underlying assumption. \n And I want to go back to your second question around international. Can you repeat that? \nJames Hollingshead: France launch. \nAna Chadwick: So I'll start. As we've said, the timing of the France launch will be here over the summer. And the teams are ready. They worked out all the pricing, and they're working all the sales force and everything. So we expect, as we mentioned, that every country is slightly different. In France, there tends to be more of this 4-year cycle of contract renewals as people might have been previously in pumps and so on. So we are assuming in our financials more of that uptick into the later half of the year, very -- like later into the year as it ramps and it takes time but really being a tailwind for us in 2025. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: I wanted to just ask on the pharmacy channel. And so it's enjoyed exclusivity sort of getting patient access through their pharmacy benefit. Our team doesn't think there's really much risk to the current model reimbursement levels that insulin is achieving or securing. But are there any theoretical risk as some of the tubed pump competitors start to open up that channel for patients and just thinking about either reimbursement levels or just the model overall in terms of pump reimbursement into the pharmacy channel? \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, Josh. Really, really good question, and it's something we could have a very complicated conversation about, right? But the very simple answer from our point of view is that what's unique about pharmacy access for Omnipod 5 is that the product fits the channel really, really well. And tubed pumps are durable equipment, and they don't fit the channel very well. So as anybody trying to enter the market and get into the pharmacy channel with some sort of durable equipment plus some consumable thing, it will be very difficult. \n From them to do it, they'll have to do with lots of workarounds. There's going to be reimbursement challenges. There's going to be scripting challenges and all kinds of things that we could have a much longer conversation about and never say never. We're very mindful of competition. We have a lot of respect for our competitors. But it's taken us several years to build out the scale and scope we have in pharmacy channel. \n And as we referred to in our prepared remarks, Omnipod 5 is available in retail pharmacy within 5 miles of 85% of the U.S. population. That is going to be very, very difficult for any of our durable pump competitors to replicate. And the overall model of Omnipod 5 with its very easy access, ease of use, ease of setup, get it in a box at the pharmacy where you get your insulin, that model just fits very, very well, and I think the durable pump model does not fit the channel well. \nOperator: Thank you all so much for your questions. This does conclude our Q&A section. And I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. \nJames Hollingshead: Thanks, operator. In closing, we're off to a great start in 2024. We're transforming diabetes care globally with Omnipod 5, which now also includes our limited commercial launches with G7 in the U.S. and with G6 and Libre 2 Plus internationally. We've got a very strong market leadership position, the right product portfolio to address the needs of both the type 1 and the type 2 global markets and a clear and focused strategy to drive continued growth leveraging our significant competitive advantages. \n Looking ahead, the balance of the year is going to include a number of important milestones for us as we've been through on the call. We expect all of those milestones to help us drive new customer starts and margin expansion in the second half of this year and lay the foundation for significant long-term growth, all of that while continuing to deliver on our mission to simplify the lives of people with diabetes all over the world. \n I just want to thank the entire global Insulet team for your dedication and passion for our customers and for our mission. You're doing a great job, global Insulet team. Thank you very much. \n Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Hollingshead",
            "content": "Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Coming out of the 2023 that saw Insulet emerge as the clear industry leader, we entered 2024 with significant momentum. We were off to a great start in Q1, fueled by continuing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our global Insulet team continues to execute at a high level, bolstering our confidence in another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion. Our first quarter revenue results exceeded our expectations for every product line. Given those results and the cascade of innovations that we plan to deliver this year, we have increased our guidance for both top line and operating margin growth. \n On today's call, I want to do 3 things: provide a high-level review of our Q1 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; give an update on our broad innovation agenda for 2024 including our efforts to expand the Omnipod 5 platform and our progress in the type 2 market; and discuss our ongoing efforts to capture the value of scale across our business.\n Starting with financial performance. Our first quarter revenue and margins exceeded our expectations. We achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, including U.S. growth of 23% and international growth of 15%. In the U.S., we continue to build on our clear leadership in the market, and our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was #1 in new customer starts by a wide margin. Demand for Omnipod 5 remains very high, and U.S. new customer starts were robust and in line with our expectations. \n Omnipod 5 is designed to expand the market through its ease of use and easy access, and we continue to succeed in driving market growth. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our new starts came from people previously using multiple daily injections, our target market, and our competitive conversions remained very strong. The Omnipod platform also remains the top choice for people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Type 2 patients represented roughly 25% of our new starts in the quarter. \n Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be when we first brought it to market. This is true in the U.S. and also internationally, where it is dramatically accelerating our growth. Last year's successful launches in the U.K. and Germany continued to exceed our expectations as our teams generate strong new customer starts. In fact, in Q1, more than half of our total international new customer starts were Omnipod 5. \n Given Omnipod 5's early contribution in our European markets, we are raising our international revenue outlook by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. As a result, we now expect total Omnipod growth of 19% at the high end and 18% for total company, representing a milestone of $2 billion in total company revenue. Ana will provide more details on our increased guidance in a few moments. \n Our global results in Q1 make one thing very clear. Omnipod 5 is, without a doubt, highly differentiated and the best offer on the market. Its ease of use, pay-as-you-go economics, affordability and widespread access make it the obvious choice for insulin delivery for people with type 1 diabetes and soon for people with type 2 diabetes once we achieve label expansion. Omnipod 5 leads the market everywhere it goes, and we are not stopping there. \n During Q1, we made significant strides across our innovation portfolio. Because Omnipod 5 is the market leader, it's easy to forget that the current version remains our initial minimum viable product. In 2024, we will expand on the Omnipod 5 platform by bringing new sensor integrations, launching the system in new geographies and extending our phone control offering. \n In the U.S. during Q1, we entered limited market release of our integration with Dexcom's G7 and are on track for full market release this summer, which will allow us to expand choice for customers and capture the opportunity created by the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. In Europe, we successfully entered limited market release of our integration with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor in both the U.K. and the Netherlands, ahead of our midyear launch plans. \n This release represents 2 firsts. Omnipod 5 is the first AID system to offer integration with the Libre 2 sensor in Europe, which is Abbott's most widely adopted CGM. And Omnipod 5 in the Netherlands represents our first sensor of choice pod offering. These pods are compatible with both Abbott's Libre 2 Plus and Dexcom's G6 sensor. Early results from the U.K. and the Netherlands are extremely promising, and we look forward to providing future updates with regard to the timing of full market release. \n Staying in Europe, we are pleased to announce that we now plan to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in France also this summer. France has historically been one of our largest markets and one in which we know demand for our solutions is high. When we first launched Omnipod DASH in this market, it quickly became the insulin pump brand of choice, and we are confident in our ability to drive strong adoption with our advanced AID system. With the launch in France, we will achieve our stated goal of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers and reach this milestone ahead of our internal end-of-year expectations. \n We anticipate our recent Omnipod 5 international launches will fuel accelerated new customer starts in the second half of this year and revenue growth next year and beyond. We also plan to enter our U.S. limited market release for our iOS app this summer. Extending Omnipod 5 onto the iPhone platform is one of our most frequently requested features, and we are excited to bring this offer to market. \n Turning to the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, where we remain the U.S. market leader in this large and underserved patient population. The commercial pilot with Omnipod GO, our FDA-cleared offering for the over 3 million people in the U.S. who need daily basal-only insulin, continues to offer significant learnings. Because of our pilot efforts, we have developed a better understanding of this market, and we have expanded the definition of targeted patient segments. We now also have even greater confidence that we will be able to bring our innovative technology to a broader range of HCP and physician practices. We are refining our plans for extended commercial reach based on those learnings. \n We also know that there is significant current demand for solutions that support intensive insulin use for people with type 2 diabetes. In this market, Omnipod DASH continues to perform extremely well driven by its ease of use and accessibility. In that context, we are very excited about the progress we are making towards achieving FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 for type 2.\n During Q1, we reached a key milestone in our SECURE-T2D pivotal trial with the last patient completing the protocol. We are well on track to meet our goal of submitting to the FDA for label expansion by the end of the year. Once cleared, we expect to meaningfully accelerate Omnipod 5 adoption among the approximate 2.5 million people with insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes. And we will have the broadest offering of insulin delivery technology solutions on the market for this important patient population. \n Lastly, we continue to analyze the market impact of GLP-1 use. Analysis of actual claims data demonstrates that GLP-1 use accelerates the adoption of insulin among people living with type 2 diabetes. The data are definitive and striking and strengthen our conviction in the size of the unmet need and the size of the business opportunity for our growing type 2 portfolio. We are finalizing our analysis and look forward to providing a more detailed update soon. \n 2024 is shaping up as we planned to be a year filled with a cascade of innovations that will allow us to build on our position and market leadership, and we will take advantage of those innovations because of our expanding scale. Our business continues to enjoy several advantages that we've achieved through commercial scope and operational scale. \n First, our products have very broad reimbursement with more than 95% of covered lives in the U.S. for both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH. And through our nationwide distribution reach, Omnipod is available at retail pharmacies that are within 5 miles of over 85% of the U.S. population. \n Our strategy to increase awareness of Omnipod with endocrinologists and primary care physicians has resulted in an expanded base of health care providers writing scripts for our products, fueling our leadership position. In the U.S., in Q1, the number of U.S. Omnipod 5 prescribing HCPs grew to over 20,000, up from over 18,500 the prior quarter. These prescribers were endocrinologists, PCPs and other HCPs, and the split was approximately 1/3 each. And the prescribers span both the type 1 and type 2 markets, and both increased substantially year-over-year. \n In order to fuel our growth, we are further expanding our commercial reach. Internationally, we continue to prudently invest in our commercial expansion and in our market access capabilities. In the U.S., we are in the process of incrementally expanding our sales force, including the creation of new territories and expansion into targeted pediatric centers. Our broad sales, marketing and channel capabilities allow us to reach a large and growing population of patients and represent a growing set of advantages over aspiring competitors.\n Lastly, we also enjoyed significant financial benefits from our scaled manufacturing. Insulet has been on a 20-year journey of capability building and continuous improvement, which has allowed us to build world-class capabilities to drive ongoing quality and productivity. Manufacturing scale and scope have been big drivers of our gross margin expansion over that time, and we expect our new Malaysia facility will fuel continued efficiency gains. \n We are in the final stages of validating our manufacturing lines in Malaysia and expect to begin producing salable product in Q3. The facility represents a sizable investment of approximately $200 million over the course of 4 years through 2026, provides approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and is expected to house more than 1,000 full-time employees at full capacity.\n Our regional sourcing strategy includes using local suppliers for components contributing to resiliency and improved costs. This facility will also strengthen our global operational capabilities, drive increased capacity to meet our robust demand and support future international market expansion. We expect our Malaysia site to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production ramping over time. It represents one of the many opportunities we have to lower total landed product costs and expand margins over the near and long term.\n Our advantages in scope and scale put Insulet in a strong position to continue to invest in the growth of our business and to expand our margins. This is yet another way in which our business is unique among our direct competitors. \n With that, I'll introduce Ana, who is joining us for her first call as our CFO. As you will have seen in our announcement, Ana is a highly accomplished and proven leader. We are thrilled to have her join the Insulet team, and I'm personally looking forward to benefiting from her partnership as we execute our strategy to drive rapid growth and strengthen our financial profile. Over to you, Ana. Thanks, Margaret. Great question. We think that the timing of the product launches is really critical to ramping over the course of the year in '24. And so that's why we're really excited to be in LMR and be able to say that we anticipate full release of G7 in the U.S. over the summer and to already be in LMR going really well with our sensor of choice offering with -- including the Libre 2 Plus in Europe. And we do think that both new customer starts continue to accelerate over the course of the year and revenue continues to accelerate, and we'll see the revenue results more strongly in the second half. I think there's a bunch of things. And let me start with the stocking question and then come back to the competitive question. So stocking, we're only ever going to call that out if there's something unusual. And channel -- the stock in the channel is back to normal. We don't see anything unusual happening, and we're not going to talk about that unless we ever see something change that we think changes the trend or whatever. So that dynamic is totally ordinary in the quarter. \n So on the competitive position, we feel really strong about our competitive position. We're very, very confident in our competitive position. New customer starts in the first quarter in the U.S. came in right in line with our expectations, and obviously, in Europe did really, really well, which led us to raise our guide. \n And I think competitively -- give me an opportunity to just say a little bit about how we see the dynamic, which I'll try to be concise with. In the U.S. in type 1, the bulk of the market is still on MDI, as you all know. So we estimate that, as we've said before, 40% of type 1 patients in the U.S. are using some sort of pump technology and 60% are not. Our offering in Omnipod 5 has been designed to convert people off of MDI onto our technology because it's so simple to use, simple to put on, simple to use, simple to stay on, easy to access, great economics and great clinical outcomes. \n And so that's why we always say MDI is our target market. And from a competitive positioning point of view, we win that battle very, very handily. We clearly lead the market in MDI. And it's really Omnipod 5 that's growing in the market in type 1 for technology because we have such a clear leadership position there. In the remaining 40% that's penetrated, you do see there's a portion of that market which does have some competitive switching. \n And what we see over and over again and again in this quarter is that we have the net winners in the competitive switching game, and that's a smaller part of the market to begin with. And then it's only a fraction of that market that's up for conversion at any given time because of the 4-year lock-in on the tubed pumps. But we are clearly the net winners in any kind of competitive switching dynamics. \n So in sum, we lead in type 1, clearly. We lead in type 2, clearly. We lead very clearly in MDI, and we win the competitive switching game in the installed base. And so we feel very confident. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. And we see that over and over again. Thanks, Jeff. Great question. We are really excited about the opportunity for AID in the type 2 market. And as we know, we're already the clear leader in that market with Omnipod DASH. So in the pump market with Omnipod DASH, very clear leader. And you all know we don't promote Omnipod 5 because we don't have the label. So we don't promote Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market. But it gets written off label fairly frequently, as you can kind of reverse engineer out of our numbers. \n That's why we're so excited to be getting so close to filing with the FDA for a label extension. Because right now, we're out in the market with one arm tied behind our back. And we have a very firm conviction that as we get that label extension, we'll be able to drive dramatic growth in the use of Omnipod 5 specific -- not just AID obviously but Omnipod 5 specifically in that market. \n So we're getting very close. As we said about the pivotal trial, we've not just completed enrollment, but we have last patient through the trial. So we're in the process of gathering, cleaning, the normal steps of pivotal. We're gathering, cleaning the data. We're preparing our FDA filing. We're well on track to file. We've given guidance that we will file by the end of the year. We are very well on track to do that. And based upon what we've seen from our competitors, we're clearly out in front of everybody else in that market. \n But also remember, Omnipod 5, the offering itself is going to be -- it has a very clear right to win in the type 2 space because of its ease of use, its discretion, its availability in the pharmacy channel, its great outcomes, which we'll demonstrate further with data in type 2. So we are very, very bullish on the type 2 market. It continues to be a very clear unmet need, and we feel like we have what will be the best offering in the market. And we'll probably be there first. Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. It's our intent to show data from the STeP trial at ADA and with a specific focus on showing the subset analysis of people who are on GLP-1s in that data. Yes. Thanks, Larry. Year-over-year in Q1, overall new starts were not up, but MDI was up for us. So that gives you a sense of our strength in bringing customers out of MDI into the market. We expect sequential growth over the course of the year in new customer starts in the U.S. As I said before, I expect a record for us in the U.S. and globally in NCS for 2024. And what was the last part of your question, Larry? Thank you very much. So G7 will be a tailwind for us once we get to full market release because of the nature of prescriptions, new customer prescriptions for CGM in the U.S. market. So I know you all look at this. But if you go look at new customer scripts for CGM, G7 has overtaken G6. And so you guys have always used -- heard me use this metaphor of fishing in a stocked pond. We've done obviously very, very well fishing in the G6 pond and have led the new starts with G6. \n And in the quarter, I think you can see from our new customer starts, it has not been a headwind for us to have the G7 out of the market and be so well adopted because what we found -- and with new customer starts right in line with our expectation, what we found is that if people want to be on Omnipod 5, they'll stay on the G6 or if they want to start AID on Omnipod 5, they go get a G6. So that hasn't been a headwind. \n But G7 will be a tailwind because there are more and more patients out there on a G7. And as we've said all along on the Omnipod 5 ride since we've launched, the CGM -- our CGM partners pave road for us. And so DexCom is now paving the road with G7. We need to get a car on that road, right? So that's why the timing of G7 launch is really important to us, and we want to get on market with it with full release as quickly as we can. And that's why we believe G7 will be a tailwind in the second half and will drive more new customer starts in the second half because we'll add G7 to the portfolio. Thanks, Patrick. It's a great question. That's part of the purpose of the commercial pilot, is to get out in the real world and see how those practices operate because historically, our call point has been endocrinology practices. And so we're out calling on primary care and specifically on primary care who, when you look at their scripting behavior overall with things like CGM and insulin, look more like endo practices than like true general practices, right? And so we've been out in the world calling on those practices to see how they manage patients, how they manage diabetes therapy. And we've learned a lot. \n And what we want to do out of that learning, coupled with the portfolio that we'll bring to market, is to figure out this -- kind of the term of the right selling motion. So that will include what's the right sales rep design, so the role description for that sales rep, what's the right support. Right now, we have quoted reps paired up with clinical service manager reps, who do both. Does that mix of rep look the same? Is it different? What's the reach? What's the so-called share of voice and design and commercial model? \n I think the reason we're so bullish on what we've learned out of the pilot is, first of all, as we've said in the past, Omnipod as a platform is so simple to use that often the phenomenon is when we walk into those practices and say, \"We're here to talk about an insulin pump,\" their first reaction is we don't do insulin pumps because they're too complicated. And then we show them Omnipod GO, and they say, \"Wait a minute. That's an insulin pump.\" And it's so simple to use that it leads to a more holistic conversation about insulin delivery. And often then they start to ask about basal/bolus solutions, which then leads us to talk about DASH. \n And so one of the key learnings is we think in those practices, there's an opportunity not just for Omnipod GO but ultimately for Omnipod 5 in intensive insulin therapy. And the other thing I think we're finding is that there's a range of patients out there. So I think the kind of stereotypical view is that type 1 patients are treated in endocrinology and type 2 -- a lot of type 2 patients are treated in general practice. But we're actually finding there's both in both. \n And so a lot of the intensive user -- intensive insulin using type 2 patients already in endocrinology, but we also see them in primary care. And we see actually a surprising number of type 1 patients being treated in primary care as well. So we think the opportunity there is different and more promising than when we initially launched the pilot, and we will be making a determination about the commercial model. And then in direct answer to your question, there probably will be some more investment in sales and support to capture it. Thanks, Matt. We think that you can see the normal cyclicality in the market, but the market is growing, first. And there's 2 drivers of market growth. The first one is the widespread adoption of CGM. And the second big driver of market growth is Omnipod 5 because it makes it so simple to come on to AID. And so as we continue to lead in MDI with a very clear leadership in the MDI position, those MDI patients are market growth for AID, and we are leading the way there. So the technology itself is driving market growth, and our CGM partners are doing it, and we're leading the way in AID. Let me start on the pods, and then I'll ask Ana to comment, go back to the Q2 financials. So the G6, G7 pods, when we get to full release of -- for the G7 integration. Those will be backwards compatible pods. So the current pods only -- can only connect with G6. But when we launch G7, the G7 pods will be G7 and G6 pods and be backwards compatible. So what that will mean for a customer or a user is that if they want to stay on the G6, they'll be able to stay on the G6 because the pods will work with it, but it will also accept G7. And so it will be kind of a sensor of choice within the Dexcom family of CGM. Ana, do you want to take the... Sure. We don't -- as you know, Steve, we don't give guidance on actual numbers and so on. But we did try to allude, I think, in the prepared remarks to the fact that Omnipod 5 is out of the gate so strong in the U.K. and Germany that already in Europe, more than half of our new customer starts are Omnipod 5. So that will give you some color on the strength of the adoption. We'll launch in France over the summer. And then the France -- we're in Netherlands in LMR, and we'll get to FMR in the Netherlands, and then we'll launch in France over the summer. And there's a ramp, as you all know, to the dynamic. \n And so that's how you should expect to see it. If we ramp in those countries the way we are, we'll see a revenue impact. And depending on how quickly we can get France actually launched, which will happen -- we've given summer as kind of a range. That will have more or less effect within the year. But we expect to have great adoption in France because Omnipod DASH has been so successful and it's so demanded by patients. So just to give you a color on kind of the starts dynamic for us. \n In terms of ASP, yes, we've been very successful in negotiating for a premium on Omnipod 5 relative to Omnipod DASH in our European markets. That's different from what we did in the U.S., as you know, where we launched Omnipod 5 effectively at price parity. But in Europe, we want to take advantage of the fact that Omnipod 5 is new technology, and that's been an important component of each individual country launches to go in and negotiate for reimbursement that's more commensurate with the value, the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so there is a mix impact on revenue as we get Omnipod 5 into each of those markets. It's a little -- the actual premium itself is a little different by market. But so far, we've been very successful in securing a premium for Omnipod 5. Thanks, Joanne. Libre 2, we're very excited. As you can imagine, we're very excited to get our Libre 2 integration into market in LMR. So far, we're having great results with the patient experience in both the U.K. and the Netherlands. And as you know, the Libre 2 form factor, that sensor for our partner, Abbott, is their most adopted sensor. And so it opens up an entirely new kind of side to the market for us, kind of serviceable addressable market, if you want to think in those terms of all of those Libre 2 users who may, therefore, also want to go on to an AID system in Omnipod 5. And Omnipod 5 is so simple to use, and the form factor is so great that we think it will have very high appeal to that Libre 2 user population. So we're very, very excited to get it out to market. Great to see the early results. \n Turning to GLP-1 and ADA data. There will be other things we'll show at ADA. We're going to show -- we'll show some subset analysis out of our pivotal trial. I'm sure we'll show an update on our real-world evidence, which has consistently shown that we deliver fantastic time in range, along with very low hypoglycemia in increasingly large populations of real-world data sets, and we'll have some other studies that we haven't yet discussed. No later than ADA, you should see us report an update on our analysis of GLP-1, which I alluded to briefly in our prepared comments. Because it's in real claims data, you can see that people who adopt GLP-1s are more likely to adopt insulin in the same year. And so we'll be documenting that with the robust presentation of the claims data, which is very exciting. Yes, it's a great question, Danielle. The first thing I would say just quickly is, on the 85-15, that was actually a pretty subtle shift in mix. That is a mix percentage, and it was fairly subtle. And we tend to give you guys -- we have an estimation on that. We don't have perfect insight into those mix data that we give on MDI versus competitive T1, T2. There's kind of an estimation range in those. And so I wouldn't over-index on the modeling in what we reported. It was a pretty subtle shift. \n Having said that, what we see -- I can't really speak to the challenges our competitors face in retaining the customers in their installed bases. What we see consistently both with our own proprietary market research, which we put in place in the last few quarters, and also with third-party data is that we are the clear net winners in the competitive switch game. So if you're a manufacturer, you can typically get a sense of how many customers you're converting from, from a competitor. But you don't often have great insight into what your loss rate is. \n And so we put in place a market analysis that allows us to better estimate that. And it's a very consistent dynamic for us since we launched Omnipod 5 that we are the net winners in that game. So we gain way more customers than we lose, both head-to-head with our competitors and then obviously overall in the market. And so that just speaks to how strong our competitive position is with Omnipod 5. It's clearly the best offer on the market, and that's what the market says with those results. Thanks, Bill. We haven't given timing on Omnipod GO. And obviously, we haven't yet filed Omnipod 5. And so the commercial pilot is intended to make sure that we have enough learning in place to put the right commercial model in place. And we'll figure out exactly how we'll bring the portfolio. So we have not updated on timing for Omnipod GO, but you can -- I think you can easily envision that with a portfolio of products, the commercial model looks different than with a single product, right? So I'll put it that way, I think. \n With the ATTD data, to me, the real-world evidence that we were able to show makes it really clear that the Omnipod 5 algorithm is a world-class algorithm. It produces fantastic results, clinical results. It produces it across age groups, across demographics. And as we've said before, one of the things that's unique about our real-world evidence is that it's from all comers. And so it's not only from highly engaged patients who upload their data. It's from all patients who are on Omnipod 5. And so when it has robust results, you can sort of see it as extra robust because it's a clear view into every corner of the user population. \n And on top of that, what it shows is we produce great time in range, as I said, but we continue to have very low hypoglycemia in our algorithm, which is a big competitive advantage for us. So that data is helping us now out in the field as we talk to physicians and continue to introduce Omnipod 5 to new users to demonstrate just how clinically effective Omnipod 5 is on top of and in addition to its great ease of use. Yes. Great question, Chris. Yes, obviously, we'd be speculating. So just to -- and we'll be publishing an update that we'll give you one more detail. So I don't want to steal the thunder of what we'll put out. So you can also look at the slides, and we can have a better conversation about it. But I'd just say we'd have to speculate what's actually happening. It's -- the analysis is based on claims data. And so it's very robust. It's very large end claims data. And what it shows is that for those patients who adopt GLP-1, they are much more likely to also adopt insulin in the same year. \n And given what we see -- and so I'm not going to speculate just for a second, okay? Given what we see with GLP-1s, we know GLP-1s lower A1c. So I think the dynamic is more likely the second -- your second suggestion, which is patients go in, they get put on a GLP-1 because their A1cs are really high. And then either they drop off of the GLP-1, which we'll also have some information on that in our deck, or they stay on GLP-1, but they haven't resolved their A1c issue. And therefore, they also go on insulin. And so that's what we see in the claims data, but we can assert out of the claims data what's actually happening in the clinic. And I'm sure it's different for every patient. But at the population level, that's the very clear and striking dynamic. France launch. Thanks, Josh. Really, really good question, and it's something we could have a very complicated conversation about, right? But the very simple answer from our point of view is that what's unique about pharmacy access for Omnipod 5 is that the product fits the channel really, really well. And tubed pumps are durable equipment, and they don't fit the channel very well. So as anybody trying to enter the market and get into the pharmacy channel with some sort of durable equipment plus some consumable thing, it will be very difficult. \n From them to do it, they'll have to do with lots of workarounds. There's going to be reimbursement challenges. There's going to be scripting challenges and all kinds of things that we could have a much longer conversation about and never say never. We're very mindful of competition. We have a lot of respect for our competitors. But it's taken us several years to build out the scale and scope we have in pharmacy channel. \n And as we referred to in our prepared remarks, Omnipod 5 is available in retail pharmacy within 5 miles of 85% of the U.S. population. That is going to be very, very difficult for any of our durable pump competitors to replicate. And the overall model of Omnipod 5 with its very easy access, ease of use, ease of setup, get it in a box at the pharmacy where you get your insulin, that model just fits very, very well, and I think the durable pump model does not fit the channel well. Thanks, operator. In closing, we're off to a great start in 2024. We're transforming diabetes care globally with Omnipod 5, which now also includes our limited commercial launches with G7 in the U.S. and with G6 and Libre 2 Plus internationally. We've got a very strong market leadership position, the right product portfolio to address the needs of both the type 1 and the type 2 global markets and a clear and focused strategy to drive continued growth leveraging our significant competitive advantages. \n Looking ahead, the balance of the year is going to include a number of important milestones for us as we've been through on the call. We expect all of those milestones to help us drive new customer starts and margin expansion in the second half of this year and lay the foundation for significant long-term growth, all of that while continuing to deliver on our mission to simplify the lives of people with diabetes all over the world. \n I just want to thank the entire global Insulet team for your dedication and passion for our customers and for our mission. You're doing a great job, global Insulet team. Thank you very much. \n Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter."

            "name": "Ana Chadwick",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the first quarter financial results, I want to say how excited I am to be part of this outstanding company. Insulet is transforming diabetes management and improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people while driving strong financial performance. I am confident that we're just getting started, especially with the exciting developments in our pipeline. \n I look forward to partnering with Jim, our skilled leadership and the rest of Insulet's talented global team to advance our mission for our customers while also delivering robust revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value. And above all else, I look forward to helping make a positive impact on people around the world with diabetes. \n Now on to our first quarter results. First quarter exceeded our expectations, and we generated strong global new customer starts. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 23% revenue growth driven by global Omnipod growth of 21%, and our estimated global retention and utilization trends remain stable. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind for our total revenue on a reported basis compared to first quarter last year. \n U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 23%, driven by robust growth on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes customer bases as well as expanding volume through the pharmacy channel. Adoption of Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 continues to be the driving force, and we are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release with G7, which we expect will accelerate new customer starts in the second half of this year, following our planned full market release this summer. \n Our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5 success and robust demand. With many catalysts ahead of us this year, we're laying the foundation for sustained revenue growth for 2024 and beyond. \n International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, which was well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH remains the largest percentage of our overall international volume, last year's Omnipod 5 launches in both the U.K. and Germany continue to drive notable increases in new customer starts and were the primary drivers of our accelerated growth. \n On a reported basis, foreign currency was 210 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 110 points favorable versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 69.5%, up 230 basis points on a reported basis and up 460 basis points compared to prior year adjusted gross margin. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our internal expectations, was primarily due to volume growth in the U.S. pharmacy channel with a premium on the pods as well as our International Omnipod revenue performance and improved manufacturing efficiencies.\n While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including multiple product launches globally, the timing of some expected spend shifted into the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest to drive above-market growth while remaining committed to expanding operating margins through improvements in gross margin as well as efficiencies throughout our global business. \n Operating margin was 12.9%, and adjusted EBITDA was 20.2% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin as well as timing of spend.\n Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $750 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. As anticipated, our increased efforts to drive profitable growth are translating into expanding margins and a stronger overall financial profile.\n Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we're raising expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 15% to 19% and total company revenue growth to a range of 14% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance and now expect a range of 17% to 21% revenue growth. We expect growth to be driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption, which provides the benefits of reoccurring revenue stream due to our annuity model. \n We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half of 2024, consistent with normal historical seasonality trends. Additionally, our planned U.S. full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 this summer is expected to contribute to the acceleration of new customer starts in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to accelerate new customer starts this year, which we expect will drive further revenue growth next year and beyond. \n We have massive market opportunities not only from further type 1 MDI penetration but also as we continue to penetrate the type 2 market. We are building a type 2 product portfolio and are excited to have this be one of our accelerated growth drivers over the near and long term. \n For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. We expect growth to be driven by last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. \n The substantial rate in our international revenue outlook reflects the outperformance of new customer starts and revenue since we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany, and to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. We originally expected revenue growth in the first half of the year to be in the high single digits. With our revised outlook, we now expect first half growth of 13% to 15% and similar second half year-over-year growth profile, also up from prior expectations. \n We expect our recent Omnipod 5 launches in 1Q to contribute to new customer starts in the second half of the year and given the nature of our annuity model to more meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth in 2025. We have strong momentum internationally, and we are confident that Omnipod 5 will drive growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. \n For both the U.S. and International Omnipod, we expect quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in channels for new launches and reducing levels for prior Omnipod generations. We do not expect this to materially impact our full year outlook. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our expectations of a 50% to 60% decline. \n Turning to 2024 gross margin. We are reaffirming a range of 68% to 69%, closer to the midpoint of the range. While we have a number of opportunities that could result in further gross margin expansion this year, we want to be prudent with our expectations given risks that come with significant product launches and standing up a new manufacturing facility. We are in a fantastic position to continue driving further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to doing so. \n We also have an increased commitment to drive operating margin expansion. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D, clinical and our commercial launches, we now expect to drive some operating leverage as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. As a result, we are raising our operating margin expectations to approximately 13.5%, up 50 basis points from our original expectations. \n Although we don't guide to our effective tax rate, I will provide color since our income continues to grow. Our first quarter effective tax rate almost doubled to approximately 6% due to changes in income distribution among our jurisdictions. Given the positive trend in our earnings, we may reach a point this year where we conclude that the valuation allowance we have against our net deferred tax assets is no longer needed. We estimate this would result in a $200 million noncash reduction of income tax expense in the period the release is recorded, which we would adjust out for non-GAAP purposes. Subsequently, our effective tax rate may increase to an estimated annualized operational run rate of approximately 20% for the near term.\n Turning to our second quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 18% to 21% and total company growth of 15% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%. Growth drivers include the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, bringing with it the advantages of U.S. pharmacy channel, continued strong new customer starts and the benefits of our annuity model. With our new customer starts momentum, we expect sequential growth in second quarter, partially offset by wholesalers taking down G6 pod inventory as we begin to ramp G7 pods. And we expect to see some meaningful second half sequential dollar growth for the many catalysts we discussed.\n For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 12% to 15%, driven by the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5 in our initial markets, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we expect an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 200 basis points. Finally, we expect Q2 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $4 million to $5 million.\n In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect continued successful execution of our strategy as well as robust new customer starts in both our U.S. and international markets. In my first few weeks at Insulet, I have been incredibly impressed with what the company continues to accomplish, and I am even more energized by the incredible opportunities that lie ahead, which are greater than I had envisioned before joining. We are well positioned and remain committed to delivering sustained revenue growth and margin expansion for the balance of this year and well beyond. \n With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Travis, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. I think the main point here is to take a step back, and as you look at the U.S., we not only reaffirmed our full year guidance. We actually are taking up the low end. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we have all these cascade of new product launches, both in the U.S. and international, we're making assumptions. And as we do that, the key here is to remember that we believe the second half will be greater growth than the first, but we continue to expect the growth. And I think to call the exact timing is we're giving our best estimate. But the key important thing is that we're raising overall guidance for revenue, including international and the low end in the U.S. Sure. Listen, I'll take another stab at here the 2Q guidance. And I just -- once again, I want to put it in overall perspective for the year. We're taking up our guidance in the U.S., even in the low end. And we expect overall that sequential growth to be there, as I stated. And I think the key point to mention here is we made our best assumption here as we have this transition of product out in the market. And we called our best estimate, and we will update as we progress through the year. But we feel very confident over the entire calendar year with the guide we've given. Thank you for the question. Listen, as I mentioned here, we took the entire guidance up 500 basis points, and that's given what Jim referred to. I mean the adoption we're seeing on Omnipod 5 is phenomenal and great. We're going to be in more markets as well. And the markets -- all of these European markets have slightly different dynamics. Some of them are in 4-year cycles, so on and so forth. \n So we feel good with the guidance that we're giving. And in anything that's new, our goal and the philosophy of this team and my philosophy is we want to give you numbers that we could hit. We definitely don't want to miss. So that's kind of the philosophy in which the spirit -- and we felt the 500 basis point guide up was significant. We will learn a lot more as we go through the next few months and as we learn more of these launches, and we will update accordingly. Yes, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. We're in a really strong position as we look at our operating margin. And I'll break it down. From a gross margin perspective, we did that 69.5%. That's very strong. We look to have strength on that as we progress through the year. Now from an operating perspective, what we need to balance out here is the investments because we want to really position ourselves into the future. And as Jim and I have talked, it is kind of a good problem to have. And we have a cadence around analyzing our investments and making sure there's that rigor of those returns. \n So as we sit here, yes, we see upward mobility here in our margins. And at the same time, we want to be prudent in our capital allocation to continue to fuel the growth, and as you mentioned here, the sales force and the different investments in our product and product features and other things. So it's a real balance, and we will continue to drive margins up as our priority and continue to prioritize our investments. All right. There's a few questions here, and maybe we'll tag team here between Jim and I. Let me take the guide first. Listen, it goes back to the fundamental. First and foremost, we're increasing our revenue guide. Second point in terms of timing, we are absolutely assuming that as we put the new G7 pods into our channels, there's going to be a reduction of the G6 as it gets sold through the channel. So there is a destocking of that G6, and we have an assumption there, I'll call it, roughly in the $10 million or so. \n Now the timing of all of this is really hard to call. That's why as I get the question asked, I keep bringing everybody back up to the full year, the second half of the year. But that, I just wanted to clarify because it's been asked a few times, and that's really our underlying assumption. \n And I want to go back to your second question around international. Can you repeat that? So I'll start. As we've said, the timing of the France launch will be here over the summer. And the teams are ready. They worked out all the pricing, and they're working all the sales force and everything. So we expect, as we mentioned, that every country is slightly different. In France, there tends to be more of this 4-year cycle of contract renewals as people might have been previously in pumps and so on. So we are assuming in our financials more of that uptick into the later half of the year, very -- like later into the year as it ramps and it takes time but really being a tailwind for us in 2025."
