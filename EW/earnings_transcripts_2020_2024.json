        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us everyone. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released fourth quarter 2020 financial results.\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. Before we discuss fourth quarter's results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020. Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March, experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures and even though healthcare systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients, who need care. Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. We continue to invest in developing solutions that extend lives, improve the quality of life and offer greater value for the healthcare system. Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients. In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide.\nScott Ullem: Hey, thanks a lot Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourth quarter, we are pleased that we were able to achieve our sales guidance ranges across all product lines. Sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-year on an underlying basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 2% to $0.50 versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per share was similar at $0.49. For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying basis to $4.4 billion, adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86 and we generated over $700 million of adjusted free cash flow. During 2020, we achieved cost efficiencies, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2021. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.3% compared to 75.8% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Our rate should be lifted by an improved product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $339 million or 28.4% of sales, compared to $347 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced spending resulting from COVID and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 1% to $196 million or 16.4% of sales. This small increase was primarily the result of higher investments in TMTT and costs associated with discontinuing our SUTRAFIX program, partially offset by reduced performance-based compensation. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling seven clinical trials. Taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1% or 13.9% excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 350 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full-year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items was 12.5%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 150 basis points or $18 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million positive impact or about 2% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $287 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $400 million, less capital spending of $113 million. Now turning to the balance sheet, we have a strong balance sheet with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments as of the end of the year. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion. We have public bonds outstanding of about $600 million that don't mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were 632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We now expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million. So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2021. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. For TMTT, we expect sales of approximately $80 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $800 million to $900 million and Critical Care sales of $725 million to $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20. For the first quarter of 2021, we project total sales to be between $1.1billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.50. And so with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. While a year like 2020 could threaten to cause persistent disruptions, our strategy of patient-focused innovations remains unwavering. As we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm as excited as ever about the work happening at Edwards and more importantly what we envision for the future of patient care. I continue to believe we are poised for success and that our innovation and cultural imperative to put patients first will drive strong organic sales growth and create long-term value.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Mike. With that, we're ready to take questions. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and Management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. . Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nBob Hopkins: Great and good afternoon. Mike, I was wondering, since we just met in December, if you comment on maybe just two quick things, first question would be just how different is the environment out there right now, the selling environment out there right now versus what you seeing at the time of the Analyst Day, kind of on the margins are things getting a little worse, are they getting a little better, just would love some thoughts on that topic and then I have one quick follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yeah. I would say in general, it's been a little worse. It was already trending negative and we anticipated it was going to be a tough winter and it certainly has turned out to be that way, but probably a little worse since that time.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. And then the other thing I'd love to get your quick comments on is just thinking a little bit long-term on the tricuspid opportunity and the reason I ask is that obviously, Abbott has reported some numbers too and their tricuspid business is already annualizing at over $50 million, if you just take the results this quarter and multiply it times four, so it looks like some pretty robust interest in tricuspid repair right off the bat, so would love your thoughts on that market and how quickly you think that could develop and what hurdles might be. Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. It's interesting. So the tricuspid market size in terms of number of patients, it's very large, it's certainly as big as the mitral opportunity and we've talked about the fact that that patient group is greatly underserved. So in terms of people actually getting procedures, you're talking about 1%, 2%, 3% very low numbers. So if we can actually develop a great solution for them, it's going to be an important deal. They don't have great answers. And so the burden is going to be on us to develop great solutions and to create evidence that we are actually doing that. We have -- we have a high level of confidence that we can do it, of course mitral is going to be bigger here in the near term. It's got an earlier start, but we think there is a lot of potential in this. The patients themselves are very diverse and that's why we think, when it's all done for tricuspid patients, it's going to require a portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nDavid Lewis: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mike or Scott, I just want to followup here on guidance for a second. So obviously resurgence trends have probably trended more negatively than when you sort of gave earlier guidance in December, so while things are trending more negatively, you're still sort of holding things that are really going to drive even more significant inflection points, if you will, of course, we've got a great team, and a nice reputation and a nice really differentiated products, but the data is going to be the bigger issue and again it's -- it's got much more potential than this in the long run.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's all the questions we have, I'll turn it back to Mr. Mussallem for closing remarks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks for all the continued interest in Edwards, and even though COVID is challenging right now, we do see better days ahead and we're very optimistic about the future of Edwards Lifesciences. So Mark, Scott, and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, back to you, Mark.\nOperator: I don't think Mark's mic is open now, sir. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2020 financial results. During today\u2019s call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are not limited to financial guidance and expectations for longer term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with COVID-19 pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information maybe found in the press release, our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards\u2019 other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company\u2019s website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today\u2019s press release. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I am very proud of our passionate team and the way that they continue to serve patients during this difficult period. Our supply chain has delivered and our field team has continued to support the dedicated clinicians that count on Edwards. We are pleased to report better than expected third quarter results despite the challenges of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Sales of $1.1 billion increased 4% reflecting growth around the world. Global TAVR sales headlined our growth with continued adoption of our SAPIEN valve platform and a step-up in procedure volumes as newly diagnosed patients entered the system and were treated. In the third quarter, we are also pleased to report growing investments in new therapies and compelling clinical data announced at the recent TCT Connect Conference that we will be having a meaningful impact on future patient care. In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $745 million, up 6%. Growth was led by therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in Europe. Globally, our average selling price remains stable. Although third quarter treatment rates were lifted somewhat by the postponement of treatment in the second quarter, particularly in Europe, we believe that going forward there was no significant backlog of patients in the system. Taking a step back, we know that a sad consequence of the intense focus on the pandemic has been that many patients like those with structural heart disease are delaying screening and treatment are not being treated at all. Evidence continues to suggest that delaying valve replacement for patients with aortic stenosis inevitably results in adverse events and increased mortality. A recent Swiss study, AS Defer [ph] demonstrated that nearly 20% of patients who delayed a previous scheduled aortic valve replacement reported to the hospital with valve related symptoms or worsening heart failure. And closer to home, a study conducted last month by the structural heart program of Mount Sinai Hospital reported that 10% of patients waiting for aortic valve replacement, required urgent TAVR or passed away during the first month after elective procedures were halted due to COVID. After 3 months, 35% of patients affected by the ban on elective procedures required an urgent intervention or passed away. There is growing recognition that postponing treatment of AS has significant consequences. At the same time however, we know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients we serve as they continue to weigh the risk of COVID against the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Our observations indicate that most hospitals globally have determined that they can safely treat their AS patients in need and at the same time care for COVID patients. In conclusion, strong evidence indicates that TAVR is a proven therapy with excellent outcomes. It offers efficient use of hospital resources and can benefit many more patients whose structural heart disease is deadly and under-treated today. Now, turning back to the third quarter, TAVR results by region in the U.S., our TAVR sales increased in the mid single-digit range versus last year, despite approximately 30% growth in the year ago period. We were very encouraged by the improvement in procedure volumes in Q3, with 100% of our active sites across all 50 states, performing TAVR cases, up from approximately 90% in Q2. Third quarter growth across the more than 750 centers in the U.S. was highest in smaller centers, which are providing access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. Two-thirds of our U.S. TAVR centers have completed training and proctoring with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and physician feedback on ease-of-use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Outside of the U.S. in the third quarter, our underlying TAVR sales increased in the high single-digit range year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR, particularly in Europe, where growth continues to be faster than expected. Edwards\u2019 underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the high single-digit range. We saw unit increases in nearly every country across Europe. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform and although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, AS continues to be significantly under-treated. Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we are continuing to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3. Sales growth in Japan and other regions was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely under-treated disease and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. In China, where Edwards recently received regulatory approvals to begin treating high-risk patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis, we successfully completed our first cases in the third quarter. And although it will likely take significant time to expand our TAVR presence in China, we look forward to partnering with hospitals across the country to introduce this therapy through our comprehensive proven training program. In summary, we anticipate regional variability due to the pandemic. Yet based on our year-to-date performance, we continue to anticipate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 will be at the high-end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%. We anticipate a return to double-digit growth in 2021 and we expect quarterly growth rates to be \u2013 will be lower year-over-year in Q1 and Q4 with more normal market dynamics versus higher growth in Q2 and Q3 when the COVID impact was most severe. Global TAVR growth reinforces our belief in our projection of a $7 billion plus opportunity by 2024. Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, we continue to view this opportunity as one with substantial unmet patient needs and the potential to drive significant growth. Our focus will be on the advancement of three key value drivers, which we believe are the leading indicators of our success, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, favorable real world clinical outcomes and favorable results from rigorous pivotal trials, which will ultimately support approvals and adoption. As an example of our differentiated therapies, we recently received the CE Mark and began introducing PASCAL ACE implant system for mitral and tricuspid repair. PASCAL ACE has the differentiated features of PASCAL with a narrower profile. It is designed to complement PASCAL and provide further options to optimize treatment for patients with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. In mitral valve replacement, we continue to advance both transfemoral EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 platforms and we remain on track to initiate the U.S. pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 before the end of the year. In addition, with EVOQUE tricuspid, we are encouraged by the experience gained in our early feasibility study and are on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year end. We are pleased to demonstrate clinical success in these programs as reported at the recent TCT Connect Conference. We presented roll-in data from our Class 2D pivotal study. In the U.S. centers with no prior experience, the PASCAL system showed favorable 30-day outcomes in patients with degenerative mitral valves, including low complication rates, significant regurgitation reduction and improvements in quality of life. Our 1-year CE Mark class data for PASCAL micro repair demonstrated robust and sustained MR reduction. In addition, PASCAL tricuspid repair demonstrated positive 30-day results and Cardioband tricuspid follow-up demonstrated favorable 2-year results. And importantly, we are making progress on five TMTT pivotal studies. While initial pivotal clinical trial results could be delayed by a couple of quarters, we are now enrolling patients at pre-COVID rates and looking forward to generating a body of clinical evidence across our portfolio demonstrating excellent outcomes for each one of our therapies. Third quarter global sales were $12 million. Although the situation remains fluid, we are able to resume activation of new centers in Europe and increase commercial procedures. We continue to advance our commercialization of PASCAL in Europe and remain focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. In summary, we expect procedures and activation of centers to continue to be subject to COVID interruptions in Europe. We anticipate TMTT sales of around $40 million in 2020 versus our previous estimate of $30 million to $45 million. In addition, while still early in the 2021 forecasting process, our aspiration is to double 2020 TMTT sales in 2021. We continue to believe that TMTT opportunity remains significant and now expect a $3 billion global market by 2025. We reiterate our confidence in this long-term opportunity and are passionate about bringing a portfolio of solutions to the many patients in need. In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the third quarter of $203 million were similar to the 2019 levels, decreasing 1% on an underlying basis. During the third quarter, we observed that patients were more willing to seek heart valve surgery and hospitals more able to manage surgical patient flow. Ongoing prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals also contributed to rebounding case volumes. We remain very encouraged by the steady adoption of Edwards\u2019 premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valve conduit in the U.S. In the third quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions, driven by increased demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world. We continue to add new INSPIRIS centers in both the U.S. and Europe and adoption is growing in our existing centers. Following the first commercial cases of HARPOON in Q2 in Europe, we continue to focus on intensive physician training and robust data collection for this new beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are seeing positive initial patient results with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. In summary, we continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 will decline in the 5% to 15% range from 2019. Localized COVID-19 hotspots may continue to be headwinds to procedure growth. However, our expectation remains that in Q4, our sales will return to positive growth driven by the market adoption of our newest technologies. We are excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies. In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $181 million in line with the year ago period. Demand for our products used in cardiac surgeries was solid, but was offset by the COVID-driven impact of delayed elective procedures. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were lifted by a large one-time order in Europe associated with ICU capacity expansion. However, we continue to experience a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continue to limit their capital spending as a result of COVID. In summary, we continue to anticipate that Critical Care sales will be negative for 2020 largely due to anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., which is still within our original guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5%. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold. Our 4% underlying sales growth in the third quarter was better than we expected as we performed well across all our product lines and geographies, especially Europe. Earnings were also stronger than we expected driven primarily by the top line performance, combined with our constrained spending. As I have previously mentioned, we have implemented cost control measures during COVID, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver a strong operating profit margin and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of $0.51, a 9% increase over 2019. GAAP earnings per share, was $0.01 higher at $0.52. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 75.5%, down from 75.9% in the prior year quarter. This decrease was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental cost associated with responding to COVID partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $307 million or 26.9% of sales compared to $306 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased transcatheter structural heart and field personnel-related expenses, including expanding the TMTT field organization in Europe offset by reduced spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we did not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees nor to reduce investment plans supporting our long-term strategy. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were $196 million, or 17.1% of sales compared to $195 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased investments in transcatheter mitral valve replacement clinical trials partially offset by lower TAVR clinical trial costs and reduced spending resulting from COVID. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.7% or 11.2%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 450 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which was 130 basis points or $0.01 favorable to our expectations. We continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%. Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales growth by 60 basis points or $7 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect FX to have a neutral impact to full year 2020 sales versus 2019. Our previous guidance estimated a negative $30 million impact. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates lifted our earnings by \u2013 earnings per share by $0.01. Turning to the balance sheet, we have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit up to $1 billion. Our public bonds of approximately $600 million don\u2019t mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were $631 million and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to remain at this level. Recall that in June we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a 3-for-1 stock split. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $113 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $216 million, less capital spending of $103 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $361 million. Free cash flow is negatively impacted by a $100 million payment related to the settlement of the intellectual property matter last quarter. Now, I will finish up with our 2020 guidance for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that the worst of the 20 \u2013 of the COVID financial impact to Edwards is behind us although we anticipate regional hotspots and risks for the foreseeable future. Given that, we anticipate we will achieve fourth quarter year-over-year underlying sales growth similar to the third quarter. Within our product groups, we now expect TMTT sales of around $40 million. We continue to estimate TAVR growth to be at the high-end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%, Critical Care growth to be negative for 2020, but still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5% and surgical growth still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to minus 15% versus 2019. We are raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to be now between $1.85 and $1.95. And for the fourth quarter, we estimate adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.60. And with that, I will turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by saying that Edwards is a dedicated member of the critical healthcare infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees and partners in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients. Putting patients first has never been more important than it is today. And as we stand together with the global community, I am gratified for our extraordinary team and partners and I am optimistic about the future of delivering innovations to even more patients around the world. With that, I will turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I am pleased to announce that our 2020 investor conference will be held on Thursday, December 10. We anticipate a great event in a new virtual format that I hope you will really like. As usual, this event will include updates on our latest technologies, views on longer term market potential and our outlook for the year ahead. More information will be available in the upcoming weeks on our website. With that, we are ready to take questions. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions for me and thank you for taking them. So it\u2019s heading in to Analyst Day here, I know raising guidance probably makes limited sense. But I did want to parse out sort of the fourth quarter guidance and just to be very crystal clear on what it means. Do we take the fourth quarter TAVR commentary to mean no improvement sequentially in TAVR or is it more we see some improvement at a lower rate, but we are just adjusting that for potential risk of resurgence flu what have you?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, David. So, it\u2019s a little bit of all that. We grew 4% in the third quarter. And we said that we thought the fourth quarter growth would be similar to that, which we think is pretty remarkable in a environment like this and a real testament to our team and the supply chain. There are three factors that we considered when we set our Q4 sales guidance. One of them related to what we did last year, you will all have to remember as a total company, we grew 20% and 30% TAVR growth in Q4 of \u201819 even more in the U.S. So by comparison, it\u2019s quite a difference, matter of fact so the absolute sales number in Q4 is going to be certainly higher than the sales number in Q3. There is an issue I think associated with our thinking related to the persistence of COVID-19 in the U.S. and Europe. We think it\u2019s probably prudent at this stage just to be thoughtful because of the uncertainty associated with that. And then the one other factor that I will mention is, we don\u2019t believe that there is much of a significant backlog in Europe any longer, which probably gave us somewhat of a lift, a little bit of a lift in Q3 and not be repeated in Q4.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. But you are seeing improvement in September, Mike and you are seeing some improvement into October in that underlying TAVR business in the U.S.?\nMike Mussallem: So, yes, we are not going to get into specific months, David, but you just have to remember the steep curve that we were growing at. So, when we \u2013 even if the growth rate will remain constant think of how many additional patients are being treated each month.\nDavid Lewis: Yes. So just a sequential comp issue, totally understand. And then just maybe one clinical for me and I will jump back in queue. Just the Medtronic Head-to-Head study that you announced, Mike, just kind of curious if you think that population they described represents 40% of the available patients and frankly, some clinicians feel that trial may actually favor S3 and non-hemodynamic endpoints, just kind of curious on what patient population hit that targets and your thoughts on their strategy here and impacts to the market in general? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. I think it\u2019s a testament to the fact that TAVR is certainly a competitive field right. Our whole industry is competitive and certainly TAVR is that. When we reflect on it, we put more of our focus on bringing new patients into the system. And we just think this disease is so under-treated. It\u2019s a deadly disease. It\u2019s what\u2019s most important to us. If you look at why Edwards has grown in the past or why we are going to grow in the future, that\u2019s the biggest factor. I think that we are extremely happy with SAPIEN 3and the Ultra platform and there is just a large body of high-quality clinical evidence that supports those. So, to have a Head-to-Head study on one factor, it might be it, but we believe that clinicians make decisions based on the total patient outcomes and not one singular element.\nDavid Lewis: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nBob Hopkins: Okay, great. Thank you and good afternoon. Just two quick things. One is timing timeline question, the second is a TAVR follow-up. On the timeline side, Mike, I was wondering if you can just comment on any update on the readout on the asymptomatic trial and then also on timelines for U.S. PASCAL approval? I assume those are unchanged, but just wanted to check?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks Bob. Yes, COVID-19 did impact the pace of enrollment much in line with other trials. We have been encouraged by the pickup with enrollment in Q3 compared to Q2, but we are not really providing an update at this time or we will have more to talk about at the investor conference and so we ask you to stay tuned for that.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. And then on the TAVR follow-up side, I was curious if you are able to quantify how much reschedule procedures might have helped Q3? And I was also wondering if you could just comment on the COVID flare-up that\u2019s going on right now? Is that something that is slowing TAVR currently or you are just sort of taking that into consideration, you are taking that possibility into consideration as you give Q4 guidance? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, in the beginning part of that question, Bob, you wanted me to get a little deeper on was about the backlog question and how much was there?\nBob Hopkins: Yes. In Q3, do you have a \u2013 you may not have a, but just\u2026.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Well, so we didn\u2019t. So we saw \u2013 we feel like we saw a different story in the U.S. and Europe and so U.S. is the biggest part of our business. We don\u2019t think there was much clearing of the backlog in Q3. We think that there just wasn\u2019t much carryover U.S. hospitals tend not to run with big backlogs and Europe by contrast there occasionally can be those depending on the country and we did indeed work those down. We feel like at this point in time, there aren\u2019t backlogs that are going to significantly impact our Q4 performance. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s clear.\nBob Hopkins: Yes.\nMike Mussallem: We have pretty much in the U.S. all our hospitals performing cases which means that you also have all hospitals that are screening patients. And so we are into a little bit more of a normal cadence at this point. In terms of the COVID question, I think it\u2019s a general concern. We are not trying to signal something that an inflection point that we see just a general concern with the numbers that we are watching in the U.S. and Europe, but we think it\u2019s prudent for us to be careful because of the uncertainty.\nBob Hopkins: Yes, fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the question. I have two. The first one is can you walk us through the bridge to doubling TMTT revenues in 2021? How much is that coming from PASCAL and your level of confidence of reaching that at this stage? And then my second question is, is geographic reach outside of the three core markets, I think has been next focused on China, where we are on that launch and expansion? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne. As you can imagine, we are kind of early in our planning process for 2021. So, we are kind of feeling going out there a bit and extending ourselves when we talk about our aspiration to double. So, we will probably have more to talk about that to get in-depth when we are together at the investor conference. But much like this year, the majority of those sales are likely to be PASCAL. We are not necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s going to be the addition of new sites that are going to help do that and we will have PASCAL and PASCAL ACE that will help us and we will be doing treatment of not only MR patients, but TR patients next year, meaning tricuspid. So, that combination is what\u2019s leading us to have this aspiration to double. Your question about China, we are really pleased that we completed our first cases. We think it\u2019s going to take significant time. Even though we are really excited about this, it was a major milestone for Chinese patients, the first time a multinational company is in there. There is just a lot of hurdles for a couple of reasons, some are self-imposed, we are committed to make sure that we really carefully work with physicians so that they get well-trained on our systems and get great results every time. There is also a fair amount of, I don\u2019t know maybe bureaucracy is not the right term, but there is a lot of process related to really coming up in China. So, it\u2019s going to take us some time. And frankly, it\u2019s a new journey for us to bring a therapy that\u2019s just novel to China. So, we don\u2019t have a lot of experience with that.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nMike Mussallem: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nRaj Denhoy: Hi, good afternoon. I hate to come back to this point, but the guidance for TAVR for the year, I know you are talking about sort of 5%, the upper end of the previous range. It sort of implies that the fourth quarter is going to be relatively flat I guess to the kind of 6% into this quarter. And I appreciate the commentary around Europe and maybe not seeing a bolus there. But I guess I am just curious whether there is anything more to that right, is that really a kind of pullback from where you are seeing or is it really just kind of a flattening of the recovery here into the back half of the year or the last quarter of the year?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, maybe I am looking at this much different than you, Raj, I am really excited about what\u2019s going on with our business and the fact that we are going to be able to maintain this kind of growth rate and when you consider that last year TAVR grew 30% globally. As a matter of fact, I think it was 40% in the U.S., and then we are going to put a growth rate on top of it, while the global pandemic is going on. I mean, I feel pretty proud of that. And I don\u2019t know that it gets a lot better than that. So to think that there is something that we feel uncomfortable about is probably reading the signals wrong. And I maybe I didn\u2019t say it the way I really feel about it.\nRaj Denhoy: No, that\u2019s crystal clear. Yes, definitely glass half full, not half empty. So it\u2019s crystal clear. And maybe just on PASCAL rate, so a decent, a good quarter actually in terms of where you ended up there, is that any indication of what\u2019s happening on the ground in Europe, is your strategy of pricing at a premium starting to yield some results for you there?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, we were pleased with our results in PASCAL in the quarter. And again, it\u2019s very fluid situation and having those ramping this up during the pandemic is a little bit challenging, but we are really pleased with the way it\u2019s come up. It\u2019s because we added new centers in the quarter we continue to implement what we would call our high touch models. So, we are very engaged with clinicians involved in every case and working hard to make sure that they get great results each time. So, that\u2019s really turned out to be what\u2019s most important for us. The pricing is as much as the same as we have talked about in the past, we do have a premium, we think this was a really good therapy and performs at a superior level. Obviously, we need to back that up with data, but our strategy is unchanged.\nRaj Denhoy: Okay, very good. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nMike Mussallem: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Yes, thanks for taking the question. And I am sure you will get into this more at the Analyst Day, but I have to ask the double-digit growth next year. It\u2019s easy comps this year and I would imagine everybody expected double-digit growth. How should we put this in perspective? Is this maybe double-digit growth CAGR off of 2019 numbers, any way you can help frame it, because I am sure there is a wide variance around what people interpret that to mean?\nMike Mussallem: No, you are so right, Robbie, I mean, everybody should have some pretty terrific growth, I imagine if you are in airline, you could really have impressive growth rates coming off a low base. But one of the things that I think is remarkable about Edwards is we just didn\u2019t take as bigger dip as many other companies. So, to return to double-digit growth, I think still is meaningful. If there is something that I can add for color it\u2019s what I tried to relate related to the quarters. And so we would expect in quarters like one and four that are a little bit more comparable to a steady state we would be likely to see that lower growth rates and then see much higher growth rates, which would be unusual ones probably for Q2 and Q3 when COVID was hitting the hardest, but hopefully that ends up providing some color, but your point is well taken.\nRobbie Marcus: That\u2019s really helpful. Appreciate it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up here, one of your competitors smaller in the TAVR space recently talked about at TCT some fatigue and structural heart trial recruiting, it sounds like you are more like back to normal, should we expect trials to continue with pre-COVID levels here given that doctors are still catching up on patients to a degree or should we expect that it was a 6-month delay for most trials and the clock can restart here? Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Robbie. And as you might imagine, making predictions on something like this is challenging, we kind of stick our neck out here a little bit. When we are talking about our TMTT trials, we said we think it did go back to pre-COVID levels. And in TAVR, where we have some pretty aggressive enrollments, it\u2019s probably getting closer, there might be a little short of it, but it\u2019s moving along pretty well and we are hoping that the situation continues to be stable and roll that way.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.\nMike Mussallem: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I have just one follow-up on sort of the TAVR environment and one on maybe sort of pipeline for patients and the process for getting more of these patients in the center. So, the first just you mentioned, I think Mike in your prepared remarks said that smaller centers grew faster in the U.S. here in the third quarter. I am just wondering, is that is that off of more of a constrained performance in Q2 where you find that they are sort of leading or lagging. Is there any kind of pattern in large or small centers or regionally that you can talk about just color on how all these centers are coming back? And then I want to follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks Matt. And very fair question, we have given different guidance in the past for other quarters, we are more or less just trying to tell you what we saw, which is that the smaller centers seem to grow faster in terms of being explained the why behind that, we would be speculating to some extent. We make \u2013 we can make up stories that, maybe the larger centers are in big metropolitan areas that were harder hit by COVID, but we really don\u2019t have hard evidence to back that up, Matt, but we just did see it in the smaller centers more than the larger.\nMatt Miksic: It\u2019s great. And then the follow-up just on the challenges around ramping up patients coming into the centers and being diagnosed, I have seen some of the data you have presented on, the number of Echos taking a dip in the toughest part of the pandemic and I am assuming, recovering coming out of that, is it sort of as you look at or centers look at trying to get their pace of patients up and going again for the reasons you described and the risks of patients and so on? Is it that Echo, is that set part of the process, is it just getting patients in to see their cardiologists? Where do you think maybe the biggest challenges are or the biggest, the greatest progress that\u2019s been made in turning that around?\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean, I don\u2019t want to miss the really big issue, which is that by and large, our conversation with hospitals, they have really strongly believed that they now know how to do TAVR cases or to treat structural heart patients and COVID patients at the same time. When this first hit in Q2 that was a question mark and I think that for all the right reasons for patients and for the health of hospitals, they figured that out. So, that\u2019s been important. It\u2019s hard to speak in generalities around the whole world. But if we just take U.S., which is the biggest market, when the hospital sort of closed its doors and prepared for COVID, not only did they stop doing procedures, they stopped doing screening. And so when this got turned back on, they turned on both the screening process and the actual procedures at the same way. Now, I don\u2019t know that they have actually additional screening capacity beyond what they have had in the past. So that probably becomes somewhat of the constraint, but there probably were some patients that were either lost sadly just because they passed away or are just not in the system today, that would have been otherwise in a more normal year.\nMatt Miksic: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a question on PASCAL in Europe and I am curious, Mike, if you could give a little bit of color on how centers are adopting PASCAL, we saw with TAVR, a lot of these centers carry more than one device on the market? Are you see \u2013 on their shelves, I am sorry, are you seeing the same with the mitral repair product or they are switching essentially to PASCAL from MitraClip?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. And I know I probably will be generalizing to some extent. So that\u2019s all already dangerous. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we see people completely switch from one system to another, I think that we see them more or less split again that they are very interested in PASCAL, they invite us in, in many cases, they are learning. We are part of the procedures and help them work through it. As we think about, maybe just give you something else to think about, I know we are hyper focused on how much we sell on PASCAL in the quarter. But if you really look for leading indicators of what\u2019s going to be most important for TMTT, I think those three factors, how is this portfolio of differentiated therapies really developing? Are they coming along? Are those good procedures? Are they learnable, teachable? Are they fast procedure? Are they reproducible? How about your real world clinical outcomes? Well, you saw some of the leading indicators of that at TCT Connect and I think it\u2019s encouraging. And then just how are we doing on the clinical trials? We have got some very rigorous clinical trials that are going to provide really incredible data. And so those are going to be the things that both lead to approvals and adoption, so although the sales are an interesting one to track, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a strong or leading indicator of some of these other factors. We frankly put more energy to make sure we get great results than just trying to maximize sales.\nDanielle Antalffy: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then if I could ask one more question, and that is on the Head-to-Head trials that Medtronic is running or trials, the Smart trial. And just this whole dynamic of the hemodynamic gradient and I am curious if you guys have had to counter detail that at all in the fields or if this is more noise from Medtronic and something that actual physicians care about? Thank you so much.\nMike Mussallem: Sure. I know our folks probably answer questions about that on a regular basis. what we know is we are just really pleased with the SAPIEN 3, and especially SAPIEN 3 Ultra performance, we think people have relied on it, not just normally, but even during this pandemic. I think the performance speaks for itself, we have got some pretty impressive data that has been generated over time, whether it\u2019s stroke, paravalvular leak, low pacemaker rate, the list goes on and so we just had a high level of confidence in this and don\u2019t, well we wonder where that how important that factor is going to be in long term to look at one thing.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Maeder of Piper Sandler. Please state your question.\nAdam Maeder: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start just on PASCAL is I was hoping to get some additional detail there. I think you mentioned that it has a narrow profile. So how should we think about the clinical impact is it improved safety or efficacy is it for different anatomy just any color you could provide there would be great and then I had a follow-up?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks for that Adam. So first of all think of it as having almost the same differentiated features as PASCAL so it has got the independent panels it has got the spacer all those things like the PASCAL but with a narrower profile it is a night in all based system, the question you asked about, okay, how is it going to manifest itself clinically? We were expecting it to be a compliment, that as physicians gain experience, they will say, oh, maybe this is a good case, to use a PASCAL ACE. Frankly, we are still early in our experience. And those are some of the answers that we are going to get as we get deeper experience at this point, we are still, it\u2019s still new enough that we can\u2019t say definitively where that\u2019s going to fit on a long-term basis.\nAdam Maeder: Got it, okay. Thanks for the color there, Mike. And then for the follow-up, maybe switching to TAVR just curious if you had a sense for, the number of U.S. TAVR sites that were added in Q3 what are the expectations going forward? Do you think we are in an environment now where we can see new sites start to come back online at a healthy clip? Thanks so much for taking the questions.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. I am trying to think of the data I know that we talked about the fact that there were about 750. The last time we reported them, I don\u2019t remember what the number is. And so I have to go back and check on that. Just to give you a little bit color, we are probably anticipating the U.S. that this maxes out maybe in the 850 range. So I don\u2019t know if that helps you think about it, the rate that they are actually joining, I don\u2019t know, off the top of my head.\nAdam Maeder: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thank you for the question. So I just wanted to follow-up on that center question for next year, when you are thinking about the double-digit growth? Do you need to add a lot of centers to do that? Can you talk about your assumptions for center adds and how much of that growth comes from the existing versus new centers?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks for that. Well, you could imagine most of our growth is going to come from existing centers, new centers, by their nature are smaller. I don\u2019t know the specific number that\u2019s in there. Maybe that\u2019s a good question to ask if the investor conference, but that\u2019s not going to be the bulk of our growth, the bulk of our growth is going to come from growth in existing centers. I remember, we are at 750 already. So to drive these kind of big numbers, you can just you can anticipate that.\nMatt Taylor: And just to follow everybody kind of answering around this question. But I mean, the consensus is modeled around 19% or 20% growth when the old number and you are touching a double digit growth can you comment at all about consensus and whether you think that\u2019s aggressive realistic is there a scenario that you can do that number?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, maybe that is intimately familiar with the consensus as you are, but I will just remind you that of which say 19% is probably driven off a much lower base than Edwards is actually delivering in 2020. So, what you might want to do is to think about it more in terms of the actual sales rather than a sales growth rate.\nMatt Taylor: Okay. Alright. Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state you question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two, on the pipeline, one on catalyst in the 2021, what are the most important ones, Mike? What \u2013 I am not interested in laundry, I am not asking for a laundry list, but what do you think the most important ones are? And I am specifically interested to know if we could see the Collapse 2D data next year and EVOQUE for tricuspid CE Mark approval? And I have one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, I don\u2019t think we are going to see pivotal trial results in 2021. I think those are more likely to come in 2022. I do expect there to be a steady drumbeat of new data almost on a continuous basis. We have so many innovations going on, Larry, that I think at every meeting, you are going to see follow-ups on CE Mark studies, you are going to see first experiences, you are going to see a lot of things that are really powerful leading indicators, but in terms of the pivotal trial, I don\u2019t think that we have one in \u201821.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks. Like other tricuspid market, there does seem to be a lot of enthusiasm for transcatheter tricuspid therapies. And I guess my question for you is do you think we are going to need randomized controlled data to kind of drive that market outside the U.S. or do you think it could develop like we saw TAVR or develop before you came out with a partner trial there, you got pretty strong uptake for SAPIEN in Europe before the randomized controlled data? So what do you think, what\u2019s your view on the tricuspid module when it\u2019s going to take to drive that?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So Larry, I mean, you are pretty familiar, right. You came along for this journey, and TAVR. And even though we had nice sales for TAVR in Europe, they really didn\u2019t take off until we had the pivotal data in the U.S. and made a significant step up with those big pivotal studies. Now, having said that, kind of like TAVR, there is a lot of excitement on the part of clinicians to treat their tricuspid patients, there aren\u2019t many answers for them. And so they are anxious to have solutions. So, if we can deliver some results, we think it could be interesting, but by predicting the tricuspid adoption rate is still very difficult. I think it\u2019s going to be so important for us to get some long-term results on that before we can make it. We have a lot of studies coming TRISCEND II, the class of which was the EVOQUE trial. Of the EVOQUE TR pivotal trial, we have Class 2, which is the tricuspid trial. So, we have real trials that are pointed at and are exploring this and finding the answer to your question, but it\u2019s still early, Larry.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, one on TAVR, the asymptomatic market or moderate AS, if you will, either one of those, any numbers around how big these opportunities would be sizing either moderate or asymptomatic?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s interesting almost the more we learn about AS are the more we learn about AS. The market turns out to be pretty significant of people that are undiagnosed and not really in the system. And so it\u2019s difficult for us to say that quantitatively, we are \u2013 we do think the asymptomatic patients, is a significant population. And we think that the moderate AS is also a very significant population. We haven\u2019t been able to accurately size those at this point. That would be a good one maybe for us to get a little deeper when we are together in December, but this one we are competent that it\u2019s a driver and going to be a driver on a very long-term basis, but it\u2019s not clear what the size is at this point.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And now one quick one for Scott, maybe when you look at the spending for \u201821, Scott, as marketing spend comes back clinical trials open up, reopen or restart, I guess, how should we think about OpEx and anything on the FX dynamics for next year when you think about gross margins? Thank you guys.\nScott Ullem: Well, it\u2019s early to talk about what our permit or our operating margins may look like in 2021 I will tell you more eager to get back to full pace of travel of being out in the field to be in with customers and have ramping our clinical trials back up to your fully pre COVID levels. And so we are anticipating that those expenses will ramp as quickly as we are allowed to do it. In terms of FX for 2021, it is just premature to say when you know what happened in 2020, which is, we expected a big headwind from FX to sales. Ended up with that dissipated now we are expecting no headwinds to sales for FX. And so it just it\u2019s premature to speculate what that is going to look like in 2021. Although we will be talking more about that are at our investor conference when we give guidance in December.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please state your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Brandon on for Margaret, thanks for taking the questions. First one I just had on at TCT this year, there was lot of presentations or a lot of focus within the valves and valve treatment opportunity. But curious how meaningful this is today in practice or is this more of kind of a clinical focus. And you guys think that the data that is been collected so far is compelling enough to convince physicians to treat low risk patients while we are kind of waiting for long term durability data? And there was even some TAVR with SAVR So is that a meaningful opportunity as we move forward?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. We are really pleased to report that five year data about in TAVR and SAVR, if you will, and it said, Hey, pretty good quality of life and so forth, maintained through five years. And that data is always valuable. A little bit of what you have to do is to put it in perspective, remember that data goes back quite a ways. And so that was at that time, not sure we even had intermediate approved for very long. And so the average age of those patients were nearly 80 years old. So they were sick and at high risk. And when if you if you just take a look and see what those results look like. And now, in this fast moving TAVR, a world where improvements have been significant, we would expect that as technologies improve, and we move to lower risk patients that those results get even better. Just having a valve and a valve option for these younger patients with tissue valves or transcatheter valve is a big deal for a them to be able to avoid surgery. So we think it\u2019s something the clinical community and patients especially really value\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks and then just in terms of kind of the rebound that\u2019s going on within TAVR. I think in prior calls. We have kind of discussed that. It has been broad adoption within all this classes, any specific risk classes kind of leading the rebound now, and kind of are you happy with the progress being made into a low risk opportunity even through COVID? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks, no, we don\u2019t have any particular visibility of these patients by risk level that gives us a deeper insight to the question. You are asking about what we are seeing right now. So we just don\u2019t have much on that. In terms of the adoption of low risk, we saw a pretty steep inflection point once the data was presented last year. It is getting to a point now where it\u2019s been out there for more than a year, we are still seeing steady increases, but not at the same pace that we saw when it was first introduced last year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I will turn it back to management for closing remarks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay, well, thanks very much for your continued interest in Edwards, Scott, and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone and with that, Back to you, Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Diego. That does it from our perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. All parties you may disconnect. Have a good day. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold. Our 4% underlying sales growth in the third quarter was better than we expected as we performed well across all our product lines and geographies, especially Europe. Earnings were also stronger than we expected driven primarily by the top line performance, combined with our constrained spending. As I have previously mentioned, we have implemented cost control measures during COVID, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver a strong operating profit margin and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of $0.51, a 9% increase over 2019. GAAP earnings per share, was $0.01 higher at $0.52. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 75.5%, down from 75.9% in the prior year quarter. This decrease was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental cost associated with responding to COVID partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $307 million or 26.9% of sales compared to $306 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased transcatheter structural heart and field personnel-related expenses, including expanding the TMTT field organization in Europe offset by reduced spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we did not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees nor to reduce investment plans supporting our long-term strategy. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were $196 million, or 17.1% of sales compared to $195 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased investments in transcatheter mitral valve replacement clinical trials partially offset by lower TAVR clinical trial costs and reduced spending resulting from COVID. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.7% or 11.2%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 450 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which was 130 basis points or $0.01 favorable to our expectations. We continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%. Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales growth by 60 basis points or $7 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect FX to have a neutral impact to full year 2020 sales versus 2019. Our previous guidance estimated a negative $30 million impact. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates lifted our earnings by \u2013 earnings per share by $0.01. Turning to the balance sheet, we have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit up to $1 billion. Our public bonds of approximately $600 million don't mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were $631 million and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to remain at this level. Recall that in June we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a 3-for-1 stock split. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $113 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $216 million, less capital spending of $103 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $361 million. Free cash flow is negatively impacted by a $100 million payment related to the settlement of the intellectual property matter last quarter. Now, I will finish up with our 2020 guidance for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that the worst of the 20 \u2013 of the COVID financial impact to Edwards is behind us although we anticipate regional hotspots and risks for the foreseeable future. Given that, we anticipate we will achieve fourth quarter year-over-year underlying sales growth similar to the third quarter. Within our product groups, we now expect TMTT sales of around $40 million. We continue to estimate TAVR growth to be at the high-end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%, Critical Care growth to be negative for 2020, but still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5% and surgical growth still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to minus 15% versus 2019. We are raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to be now between $1.85 and $1.95. And for the fourth quarter, we estimate adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.60. And with that, I will turn it back over to Mike. Well, it's early to talk about what our permit or our operating margins may look like in 2021 I will tell you more eager to get back to full pace of travel of being out in the field to be in with customers and have ramping our clinical trials back up to your fully pre COVID levels. And so we are anticipating that those expenses will ramp as quickly as we are allowed to do it. In terms of FX for 2021, it is just premature to say when you know what happened in 2020, which is, we expected a big headwind from FX to sales. Ended up with that dissipated now we are expecting no headwinds to sales for FX. And so it just it's premature to speculate what that is going to look like in 2021. Although we will be talking more about that are at our investor conference when we give guidance in December."

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I am very proud of our passionate team and the way that they continue to serve patients during this difficult period. Our supply chain has delivered and our field team has continued to support the dedicated clinicians that count on Edwards. We are pleased to report better than expected third quarter results despite the challenges of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Sales of $1.1 billion increased 4% reflecting growth around the world. Global TAVR sales headlined our growth with continued adoption of our SAPIEN valve platform and a step-up in procedure volumes as newly diagnosed patients entered the system and were treated. In the third quarter, we are also pleased to report growing investments in new therapies and compelling clinical data announced at the recent TCT Connect Conference that we will be having a meaningful impact on future patient care. In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $745 million, up 6%. Growth was led by therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in Europe. Globally, our average selling price remains stable. Although third quarter treatment rates were lifted somewhat by the postponement of treatment in the second quarter, particularly in Europe, we believe that going forward there was no significant backlog of patients in the system. Taking a step back, we know that a sad consequence of the intense focus on the pandemic has been that many patients like those with structural heart disease are delaying screening and treatment are not being treated at all. Evidence continues to suggest that delaying valve replacement for patients with aortic stenosis inevitably results in adverse events and increased mortality. A recent Swiss study, AS Defer [ph] demonstrated that nearly 20% of patients who delayed a previous scheduled aortic valve replacement reported to the hospital with valve related symptoms or worsening heart failure. And closer to home, a study conducted last month by the structural heart program of Mount Sinai Hospital reported that 10% of patients waiting for aortic valve replacement, required urgent TAVR or passed away during the first month after elective procedures were halted due to COVID. After 3 months, 35% of patients affected by the ban on elective procedures required an urgent intervention or passed away. There is growing recognition that postponing treatment of AS has significant consequences. At the same time however, we know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients we serve as they continue to weigh the risk of COVID against the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Our observations indicate that most hospitals globally have determined that they can safely treat their AS patients in need and at the same time care for COVID patients. In conclusion, strong evidence indicates that TAVR is a proven therapy with excellent outcomes. It offers efficient use of hospital resources and can benefit many more patients whose structural heart disease is deadly and under-treated today. Now, turning back to the third quarter, TAVR results by region in the U.S., our TAVR sales increased in the mid single-digit range versus last year, despite approximately 30% growth in the year ago period. We were very encouraged by the improvement in procedure volumes in Q3, with 100% of our active sites across all 50 states, performing TAVR cases, up from approximately 90% in Q2. Third quarter growth across the more than 750 centers in the U.S. was highest in smaller centers, which are providing access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. Two-thirds of our U.S. TAVR centers have completed training and proctoring with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and physician feedback on ease-of-use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Outside of the U.S. in the third quarter, our underlying TAVR sales increased in the high single-digit range year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR, particularly in Europe, where growth continues to be faster than expected. Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the high single-digit range. We saw unit increases in nearly every country across Europe. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform and although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, AS continues to be significantly under-treated. Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we are continuing to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3. Sales growth in Japan and other regions was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely under-treated disease and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. In China, where Edwards recently received regulatory approvals to begin treating high-risk patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis, we successfully completed our first cases in the third quarter. And although it will likely take significant time to expand our TAVR presence in China, we look forward to partnering with hospitals across the country to introduce this therapy through our comprehensive proven training program. In summary, we anticipate regional variability due to the pandemic. Yet based on our year-to-date performance, we continue to anticipate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 will be at the high-end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%. We anticipate a return to double-digit growth in 2021 and we expect quarterly growth rates to be \u2013 will be lower year-over-year in Q1 and Q4 with more normal market dynamics versus higher growth in Q2 and Q3 when the COVID impact was most severe. Global TAVR growth reinforces our belief in our projection of a $7 billion plus opportunity by 2024. Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, we continue to view this opportunity as one with substantial unmet patient needs and the potential to drive significant growth. Our focus will be on the advancement of three key value drivers, which we believe are the leading indicators of our success, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, favorable real world clinical outcomes and favorable results from rigorous pivotal trials, which will ultimately support approvals and adoption. As an example of our differentiated therapies, we recently received the CE Mark and began introducing PASCAL ACE implant system for mitral and tricuspid repair. PASCAL ACE has the differentiated features of PASCAL with a narrower profile. It is designed to complement PASCAL and provide further options to optimize treatment for patients with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. In mitral valve replacement, we continue to advance both transfemoral EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 platforms and we remain on track to initiate the U.S. pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 before the end of the year. In addition, with EVOQUE tricuspid, we are encouraged by the experience gained in our early feasibility study and are on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year end. We are pleased to demonstrate clinical success in these programs as reported at the recent TCT Connect Conference. We presented roll-in data from our Class 2D pivotal study. In the U.S. centers with no prior experience, the PASCAL system showed favorable 30-day outcomes in patients with degenerative mitral valves, including low complication rates, significant regurgitation reduction and improvements in quality of life. Our 1-year CE Mark class data for PASCAL micro repair demonstrated robust and sustained MR reduction. In addition, PASCAL tricuspid repair demonstrated positive 30-day results and Cardioband tricuspid follow-up demonstrated favorable 2-year results. And importantly, we are making progress on five TMTT pivotal studies. While initial pivotal clinical trial results could be delayed by a couple of quarters, we are now enrolling patients at pre-COVID rates and looking forward to generating a body of clinical evidence across our portfolio demonstrating excellent outcomes for each one of our therapies. Third quarter global sales were $12 million. Although the situation remains fluid, we are able to resume activation of new centers in Europe and increase commercial procedures. We continue to advance our commercialization of PASCAL in Europe and remain focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. In summary, we expect procedures and activation of centers to continue to be subject to COVID interruptions in Europe. We anticipate TMTT sales of around $40 million in 2020 versus our previous estimate of $30 million to $45 million. In addition, while still early in the 2021 forecasting process, our aspiration is to double 2020 TMTT sales in 2021. We continue to believe that TMTT opportunity remains significant and now expect a $3 billion global market by 2025. We reiterate our confidence in this long-term opportunity and are passionate about bringing a portfolio of solutions to the many patients in need. In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the third quarter of $203 million were similar to the 2019 levels, decreasing 1% on an underlying basis. During the third quarter, we observed that patients were more willing to seek heart valve surgery and hospitals more able to manage surgical patient flow. Ongoing prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals also contributed to rebounding case volumes. We remain very encouraged by the steady adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valve conduit in the U.S. In the third quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions, driven by increased demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world. We continue to add new INSPIRIS centers in both the U.S. and Europe and adoption is growing in our existing centers. Following the first commercial cases of HARPOON in Q2 in Europe, we continue to focus on intensive physician training and robust data collection for this new beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are seeing positive initial patient results with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. In summary, we continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 will decline in the 5% to 15% range from 2019. Localized COVID-19 hotspots may continue to be headwinds to procedure growth. However, our expectation remains that in Q4, our sales will return to positive growth driven by the market adoption of our newest technologies. We are excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies. In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $181 million in line with the year ago period. Demand for our products used in cardiac surgeries was solid, but was offset by the COVID-driven impact of delayed elective procedures. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were lifted by a large one-time order in Europe associated with ICU capacity expansion. However, we continue to experience a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continue to limit their capital spending as a result of COVID. In summary, we continue to anticipate that Critical Care sales will be negative for 2020 largely due to anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., which is still within our original guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5%. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by saying that Edwards is a dedicated member of the critical healthcare infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees and partners in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients. Putting patients first has never been more important than it is today. And as we stand together with the global community, I am gratified for our extraordinary team and partners and I am optimistic about the future of delivering innovations to even more patients around the world. With that, I will turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, David. So, it's a little bit of all that. We grew 4% in the third quarter. And we said that we thought the fourth quarter growth would be similar to that, which we think is pretty remarkable in a environment like this and a real testament to our team and the supply chain. There are three factors that we considered when we set our Q4 sales guidance. One of them related to what we did last year, you will all have to remember as a total company, we grew 20% and 30% TAVR growth in Q4 of \u201819 even more in the U.S. So by comparison, it's quite a difference, matter of fact so the absolute sales number in Q4 is going to be certainly higher than the sales number in Q3. There is an issue I think associated with our thinking related to the persistence of COVID-19 in the U.S. and Europe. We think it's probably prudent at this stage just to be thoughtful because of the uncertainty associated with that. And then the one other factor that I will mention is, we don't believe that there is much of a significant backlog in Europe any longer, which probably gave us somewhat of a lift, a little bit of a lift in Q3 and not be repeated in Q4. So, yes, we are not going to get into specific months, David, but you just have to remember the steep curve that we were growing at. So, when we \u2013 even if the growth rate will remain constant think of how many additional patients are being treated each month. Yes, thanks. I think it's a testament to the fact that TAVR is certainly a competitive field right. Our whole industry is competitive and certainly TAVR is that. When we reflect on it, we put more of our focus on bringing new patients into the system. And we just think this disease is so under-treated. It's a deadly disease. It's what's most important to us. If you look at why Edwards has grown in the past or why we are going to grow in the future, that's the biggest factor. I think that we are extremely happy with SAPIEN 3and the Ultra platform and there is just a large body of high-quality clinical evidence that supports those. So, to have a Head-to-Head study on one factor, it might be it, but we believe that clinicians make decisions based on the total patient outcomes and not one singular element. Yes. Thanks Bob. Yes, COVID-19 did impact the pace of enrollment much in line with other trials. We have been encouraged by the pickup with enrollment in Q3 compared to Q2, but we are not really providing an update at this time or we will have more to talk about at the investor conference and so we ask you to stay tuned for that. Yes, in the beginning part of that question, Bob, you wanted me to get a little deeper on was about the backlog question and how much was there? Yes. Well, so we didn't. So we saw \u2013 we feel like we saw a different story in the U.S. and Europe and so U.S. is the biggest part of our business. We don't think there was much clearing of the backlog in Q3. We think that there just wasn't much carryover U.S. hospitals tend not to run with big backlogs and Europe by contrast there occasionally can be those depending on the country and we did indeed work those down. We feel like at this point in time, there aren't backlogs that are going to significantly impact our Q4 performance. So, I don't know if that's clear. We have pretty much in the U.S. all our hospitals performing cases which means that you also have all hospitals that are screening patients. And so we are into a little bit more of a normal cadence at this point. In terms of the COVID question, I think it's a general concern. We are not trying to signal something that an inflection point that we see just a general concern with the numbers that we are watching in the U.S. and Europe, but we think it's prudent for us to be careful because of the uncertainty. Yes. Thanks, Joanne. As you can imagine, we are kind of early in our planning process for 2021. So, we are kind of feeling going out there a bit and extending ourselves when we talk about our aspiration to double. So, we will probably have more to talk about that to get in-depth when we are together at the investor conference. But much like this year, the majority of those sales are likely to be PASCAL. We are not necessarily \u2013 it's going to be the addition of new sites that are going to help do that and we will have PASCAL and PASCAL ACE that will help us and we will be doing treatment of not only MR patients, but TR patients next year, meaning tricuspid. So, that combination is what's leading us to have this aspiration to double. Your question about China, we are really pleased that we completed our first cases. We think it's going to take significant time. Even though we are really excited about this, it was a major milestone for Chinese patients, the first time a multinational company is in there. There is just a lot of hurdles for a couple of reasons, some are self-imposed, we are committed to make sure that we really carefully work with physicians so that they get well-trained on our systems and get great results every time. There is also a fair amount of, I don't know maybe bureaucracy is not the right term, but there is a lot of process related to really coming up in China. So, it's going to take us some time. And frankly, it's a new journey for us to bring a therapy that's just novel to China. So, we don't have a lot of experience with that. Sure. Yes, maybe I am looking at this much different than you, Raj, I am really excited about what's going on with our business and the fact that we are going to be able to maintain this kind of growth rate and when you consider that last year TAVR grew 30% globally. As a matter of fact, I think it was 40% in the U.S., and then we are going to put a growth rate on top of it, while the global pandemic is going on. I mean, I feel pretty proud of that. And I don't know that it gets a lot better than that. So to think that there is something that we feel uncomfortable about is probably reading the signals wrong. And I maybe I didn't say it the way I really feel about it. Yes. So, we were pleased with our results in PASCAL in the quarter. And again, it's very fluid situation and having those ramping this up during the pandemic is a little bit challenging, but we are really pleased with the way it's come up. It's because we added new centers in the quarter we continue to implement what we would call our high touch models. So, we are very engaged with clinicians involved in every case and working hard to make sure that they get great results each time. So, that's really turned out to be what's most important for us. The pricing is as much as the same as we have talked about in the past, we do have a premium, we think this was a really good therapy and performs at a superior level. Obviously, we need to back that up with data, but our strategy is unchanged. Sure. No, you are so right, Robbie, I mean, everybody should have some pretty terrific growth, I imagine if you are in airline, you could really have impressive growth rates coming off a low base. But one of the things that I think is remarkable about Edwards is we just didn't take as bigger dip as many other companies. So, to return to double-digit growth, I think still is meaningful. If there is something that I can add for color it's what I tried to relate related to the quarters. And so we would expect in quarters like one and four that are a little bit more comparable to a steady state we would be likely to see that lower growth rates and then see much higher growth rates, which would be unusual ones probably for Q2 and Q3 when COVID was hitting the hardest, but hopefully that ends up providing some color, but your point is well taken. Yes, it's a good question, Robbie. And as you might imagine, making predictions on something like this is challenging, we kind of stick our neck out here a little bit. When we are talking about our TMTT trials, we said we think it did go back to pre-COVID levels. And in TAVR, where we have some pretty aggressive enrollments, it's probably getting closer, there might be a little short of it, but it's moving along pretty well and we are hoping that the situation continues to be stable and roll that way. Yes. Yes, thanks Matt. And very fair question, we have given different guidance in the past for other quarters, we are more or less just trying to tell you what we saw, which is that the smaller centers seem to grow faster in terms of being explained the why behind that, we would be speculating to some extent. We make \u2013 we can make up stories that, maybe the larger centers are in big metropolitan areas that were harder hit by COVID, but we really don't have hard evidence to back that up, Matt, but we just did see it in the smaller centers more than the larger. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean, I don't want to miss the really big issue, which is that by and large, our conversation with hospitals, they have really strongly believed that they now know how to do TAVR cases or to treat structural heart patients and COVID patients at the same time. When this first hit in Q2 that was a question mark and I think that for all the right reasons for patients and for the health of hospitals, they figured that out. So, that's been important. It's hard to speak in generalities around the whole world. But if we just take U.S., which is the biggest market, when the hospital sort of closed its doors and prepared for COVID, not only did they stop doing procedures, they stopped doing screening. And so when this got turned back on, they turned on both the screening process and the actual procedures at the same way. Now, I don't know that they have actually additional screening capacity beyond what they have had in the past. So that probably becomes somewhat of the constraint, but there probably were some patients that were either lost sadly just because they passed away or are just not in the system today, that would have been otherwise in a more normal year. Yes, it's a good question. And I know I probably will be generalizing to some extent. So that's all already dangerous. But I wouldn't say that we see people completely switch from one system to another, I think that we see them more or less split again that they are very interested in PASCAL, they invite us in, in many cases, they are learning. We are part of the procedures and help them work through it. As we think about, maybe just give you something else to think about, I know we are hyper focused on how much we sell on PASCAL in the quarter. But if you really look for leading indicators of what's going to be most important for TMTT, I think those three factors, how is this portfolio of differentiated therapies really developing? Are they coming along? Are those good procedures? Are they learnable, teachable? Are they fast procedure? Are they reproducible? How about your real world clinical outcomes? Well, you saw some of the leading indicators of that at TCT Connect and I think it's encouraging. And then just how are we doing on the clinical trials? We have got some very rigorous clinical trials that are going to provide really incredible data. And so those are going to be the things that both lead to approvals and adoption, so although the sales are an interesting one to track, I don't know that it's a strong or leading indicator of some of these other factors. We frankly put more energy to make sure we get great results than just trying to maximize sales. Sure. I know our folks probably answer questions about that on a regular basis. what we know is we are just really pleased with the SAPIEN 3, and especially SAPIEN 3 Ultra performance, we think people have relied on it, not just normally, but even during this pandemic. I think the performance speaks for itself, we have got some pretty impressive data that has been generated over time, whether it's stroke, paravalvular leak, low pacemaker rate, the list goes on and so we just had a high level of confidence in this and don't, well we wonder where that how important that factor is going to be in long term to look at one thing. Yes, thanks for that Adam. So first of all think of it as having almost the same differentiated features as PASCAL so it has got the independent panels it has got the spacer all those things like the PASCAL but with a narrower profile it is a night in all based system, the question you asked about, okay, how is it going to manifest itself clinically? We were expecting it to be a compliment, that as physicians gain experience, they will say, oh, maybe this is a good case, to use a PASCAL ACE. Frankly, we are still early in our experience. And those are some of the answers that we are going to get as we get deeper experience at this point, we are still, it's still new enough that we can't say definitively where that's going to fit on a long-term basis. Yes, thanks. I am trying to think of the data I know that we talked about the fact that there were about 750. The last time we reported them, I don't remember what the number is. And so I have to go back and check on that. Just to give you a little bit color, we are probably anticipating the U.S. that this maxes out maybe in the 850 range. So I don't know if that helps you think about it, the rate that they are actually joining, I don't know, off the top of my head. Yes, thanks for that. Well, you could imagine most of our growth is going to come from existing centers, new centers, by their nature are smaller. I don't know the specific number that's in there. Maybe that's a good question to ask if the investor conference, but that's not going to be the bulk of our growth, the bulk of our growth is going to come from growth in existing centers. I remember, we are at 750 already. So to drive these kind of big numbers, you can just you can anticipate that. Yes, maybe that is intimately familiar with the consensus as you are, but I will just remind you that of which say 19% is probably driven off a much lower base than Edwards is actually delivering in 2020. So, what you might want to do is to think about it more in terms of the actual sales rather than a sales growth rate. Yes, I don't think we are going to see pivotal trial results in 2021. I think those are more likely to come in 2022. I do expect there to be a steady drumbeat of new data almost on a continuous basis. We have so many innovations going on, Larry, that I think at every meeting, you are going to see follow-ups on CE Mark studies, you are going to see first experiences, you are going to see a lot of things that are really powerful leading indicators, but in terms of the pivotal trial, I don't think that we have one in \u201821. Yes. So Larry, I mean, you are pretty familiar, right. You came along for this journey, and TAVR. And even though we had nice sales for TAVR in Europe, they really didn't take off until we had the pivotal data in the U.S. and made a significant step up with those big pivotal studies. Now, having said that, kind of like TAVR, there is a lot of excitement on the part of clinicians to treat their tricuspid patients, there aren't many answers for them. And so they are anxious to have solutions. So, if we can deliver some results, we think it could be interesting, but by predicting the tricuspid adoption rate is still very difficult. I think it's going to be so important for us to get some long-term results on that before we can make it. We have a lot of studies coming TRISCEND II, the class of which was the EVOQUE trial. Of the EVOQUE TR pivotal trial, we have Class 2, which is the tricuspid trial. So, we have real trials that are pointed at and are exploring this and finding the answer to your question, but it's still early, Larry. Yes, that's a good question. It's interesting almost the more we learn about AS are the more we learn about AS. The market turns out to be pretty significant of people that are undiagnosed and not really in the system. And so it's difficult for us to say that quantitatively, we are \u2013 we do think the asymptomatic patients, is a significant population. And we think that the moderate AS is also a very significant population. We haven't been able to accurately size those at this point. That would be a good one maybe for us to get a little deeper when we are together in December, but this one we are competent that it's a driver and going to be a driver on a very long-term basis, but it's not clear what the size is at this point. Yes, thanks. We are really pleased to report that five year data about in TAVR and SAVR, if you will, and it said, Hey, pretty good quality of life and so forth, maintained through five years. And that data is always valuable. A little bit of what you have to do is to put it in perspective, remember that data goes back quite a ways. And so that was at that time, not sure we even had intermediate approved for very long. And so the average age of those patients were nearly 80 years old. So they were sick and at high risk. And when if you if you just take a look and see what those results look like. And now, in this fast moving TAVR, a world where improvements have been significant, we would expect that as technologies improve, and we move to lower risk patients that those results get even better. Just having a valve and a valve option for these younger patients with tissue valves or transcatheter valve is a big deal for a them to be able to avoid surgery. So we think it's something the clinical community and patients especially really value Yes, thanks, no, we don't have any particular visibility of these patients by risk level that gives us a deeper insight to the question. You are asking about what we are seeing right now. So we just don't have much on that. In terms of the adoption of low risk, we saw a pretty steep inflection point once the data was presented last year. It is getting to a point now where it's been out there for more than a year, we are still seeing steady increases, but not at the same pace that we saw when it was first introduced last year. Okay, well, thanks very much for your continued interest in Edwards, Scott, and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone and with that, Back to you, Mark."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2020 financial results. During today\u2019s call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren\u2019t limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with COVID-19 pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards\u2019 other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company\u2019s website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are included in today\u2019s press release. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. Before we get into the specifics of the second quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on the overall environment and how Edwards is striving to deliver during these challenging times. There\u2019s no question that the world has changed considerably as a result of the COVID pandemic. However, some things haven\u2019t changed, most importantly, our patient-focused strategy and our aspirations as a company. At Edwards, our dedication to providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease remains central to our credo. Our aspiration to excel as a trusted partner and to foster an inclusive culture where all employees grow and thrive is stronger than ever. And our desire to improve access to our therapies for underserved and undertreated patient populations around the world motivates our 14,000 employees every day. An unfortunate consequence of the intense focus of the pandemic during the first few months was that many patients, like those with structural heart disease were not treated. One interesting published source highlighted how the COVID-19 surge in March and April overwhelmed Dutch hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. In this study, they estimated there were more \u2013 there were approximately 10x more healthy life years lost from regular care not being delivered compared to COVID life years lost during that period. Closer to home in the U.S., recall that the data published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery suggests that patients waiting for aortic valve replacement had a 4% mortality at one month, 8% at three months and 12% after waiting six months. The provider community is aggressively and creatively adapting to be able to treat COVID patients, while at the same time, providing the necessary care to patients with life-threatening underlying conditions. We\u2019d like to thank all the health care providers on the frontline who\u2019ve had to face the challenges of COVID-19 without a road map. And who have made difficult decisions and innovate at the same time to provide the necessary quality of care for patients in need. While the number of COVID cases remains a priority for providers, we observed already in Q2, providers are adapting to ensure treatment of their structural heart patients. As alarming as COVID is, AS remains a deadly disease and treatment delays will inevitably result in increased mortality for a condition which has proven therapies with excellent clinical outcomes in the case of TAVR, also minimal use of hospital resources. Even with the heroic efforts of the health care community, we know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients we serve as they continue to weigh the risks of COVID-19 against the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Edwards is committed to providing the opportunity for faster procedures, shorter hospital stays and exceptional patient outcomes. Irrespective of the unpredictable surges of this deadly pandemic, there is a growing recognition that valve therapy should not be postponed. Not all procedures are the same. Valve replacement therapy is less elective, and these patients have a more urgent need. We have found ourselves more aligned than ever with the interest of patients and providers during this challenging time. Now turning to the second quarter. Despite challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, we\u2019re pleased to report much better-than-expected second quarter results. Sales of $925 million exceeded the top end of our April guidance of $700 million to $900 million, driven by the continued adoption of our life-saving technologies around the world. This performance was made possible by our dedicated team, which includes our committed field organization and our global supply chain. Sales were balanced across all major geographies and benefited from improving month-to-month trends as we progressed through the second quarter. We also started to gradually resume patient enrollment in clinical trials that were slowed at the end of the first quarter, and we\u2019re working with additional centers as many are now ready to reengage. Furthermore, at TVT Connect and the virtual EuroPCR last month, we highlighted positive clinical results in multiple breakthrough therapies. Even though many on our team were working remotely during Q2, we made positive progress on a number of very important new technology milestones that will be detailed later in our comments. Finally, we were pleased for recently announced intellectual property agreement, which allows us to fully dedicate time and resources to helping patients. In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $594 million declined 11% on an underlying basis. Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise pricing discipline. As noted on our first quarter call, sales were severely depressed in April as provider turned their attention to the pandemic response. However, we were encouraged by the steady improvement in procedure volumes throughout May and June when approximately 90% of our active sites performed TAVR cases. This is a testament to the dedicated heart teams and our committed clinical field teams. We hear from a number of clinicians that new patients are increasingly entering the system as they seek treatment for severe aortic stenosis. We\u2019ve seen a significant improvement from the steep trough in April. To put things in perspective, during the second quarter in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic, there were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN technology. In the U.S., our TAVR sales declined in the low teens versus last year. As expected, April marked the most severe month year-over-year. U.S. TAVR sales declines and procedure rates remained highly variable across the country. In the last week of April, we observed the first signs of recovery and in May and June, we experienced a significant step-up in procedure volumes as previously screened patients who temporarily delayed treatment, began to return. Recently, we submitted additional data supporting the safety of our SAPIEN 3 platform in bicuspid patients. And based on these data, FDA has approved the removal of the precaution from the labeling. Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our TAVR sales declined in the high single digits year-over-year on an underlying basis. In Europe, the pace of recovery was faster than expected despite difficult early headwinds from COVID-19. In Japan, second quarter procedures were less impacted by COVID-19 than initially expected. Aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease in that region where Edwards is very focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. It\u2019s also worth noting recent TAVR approvals outside the U.S., last month in China, Edwards received regulatory approval to begin treating patients suffering from severe AS and at high-risk for open heart surgery with SAPIEN 3. We look forward to partnering with hospitals throughout China to introduce this therapy. Earlier this month, Australia joined the list of countries that approved our SAPIEN platform for treatment of severe AS patients, independent of their risk score. We believe these approvals represent important milestones for patients outside the U.S. Now shifting gears to our latest TAVR innovation, SAPIEN 3 Ultra, clinical feedback on improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Last month, at the virtual TVT Connect conference, a propensity matched analysis of 1,300 patients was presented using data from the TBT registry to compare outcomes of patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and SAPIEN 3 valves. This was the largest analysis of TAVR outcomes with Ultra, to date. Both valves demonstrated outstanding outcomes for paravalvular leak, with Ultra redefining the benchmark for transcatheter heart valve technologies moving forward. This analysis indicated that 90% of the patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra had no reported paravalvular leak at discharge. We are also very encouraged by additional data in the study, which confirm SAPIEN\u2019s ability to facilitate a more expedited in-hospital experience for patients. This included fewer ICU stays, with over 40% of the patients requiring no ICU time at all and shorter total hospital lengths of stay with approximately 50% of patients discharged within 24 hours and 80% by 48 hours. In Q2, Ultra accounted for approximately 40% of our U.S. and European TAVR volumes, up from 30% at the end of the first quarter. You\u2019ll recall that we temporarily paused SAPIEN 3 Ultra proctoring at centers that were not already trained on the device, and we resumed training in the second quarter. In summary, while the sharp decline in April was not as prolonged as we expected, we continue to envision a second half similar to our April expectations. Although there continues to be a high level of site-to-site variability, based on our second quarter performance, we now anticipate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 will be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%. Based on how we\u2019ve begun the third quarter, we continue to expect in the third quarter \u2013 we continue to expect sales in the third quarter to be approximately flat to our strong 2019 third quarter and a fourth quarter that transitions to growth over 2019. Furthermore, as patients and clinicians increasingly choose TAVR, we remain confident that the opportunity will grow to over $7 billion by 2024. Turning to TMTT, which is the transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies for patients suffering from diseases of these heart valves. In the mitral position, we\u2019re developing repair therapies with PASCAL and Cardioband as well as replacement therapies with M3 and EVOQUE. In the tricuspid position, we\u2019re pursuing the PASCAL and Cardioband repair therapies and today, we are announcing a pivotal trial of EVOQUE for tricuspid valve replacement. We have early commercial sales in Europe with several of these therapies and we\u2019re advancing each of these platforms, including five pivotal studies underway in the U.S. We continue to be very pleased with our robust, real-world evidence with PASCAL mitral repair, as highlighted during a presentation at virtual EuroPCR. The analysis of more than 1,200 commercially treated patients demonstrated an excellent safety profile and confirm that significant reduction of mitral regurgitation can be achieved after only a short learning curve for physicians. As previously announced, we\u2019re pleased to have received CE mark for PASCAL repair system for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation. Based on our early and positive class tricuspid EFS data, we have initiated an introduction in Europe with a focus on excellent outcome for this new tricuspid repair therapy. Last quarter, we announced a temporary pause of new enrollments for our active mitral and tricuspid pivotal clinical trials. In consultation with investigators and hospitals, more than half of our trial sites have begun \u2013 have been reactivated and are beginning to treat patients. We anticipate enrollment in our three class studies will continue to ramp in the third and fourth quarter, and we\u2019re still targeting U.S. approval of PASCAL DMR in 2022. Now turning to replacement therapies. We\u2019re encouraged by the early clinical experience with EVOQUE tricuspid in 25 patients recently presented by Dr. Neil Fam, which demonstrated 100%, 30-day survival as well as very significant acute reduction of tricuspid regurgitation and improvement in functional status. We\u2019re pleased to announce that we\u2019ve received approval to initiate a pivotal study for the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system, which is designed to gain U.S. approval and has breakthrough device designation from the FDA. The TRISCEND II study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the EVOQUE system compared to optimal medical therapy in patients with severe TR. In mitral replacement, we continue to gain experience with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE. Both systems utilize a transfemoral delivery approach. We are encouraged by the early experience with EVOQUE in patients with severe MR and high surgical risk. Additionally, we anticipate enrollment in our SAPIEN M3 pivotal trial to begin by the end of the year. Second quarter global sales for TMTT were $6 million. We expect to progressively ramp in Q3 and Q4, and as we activate more centers in Europe and they resume procedures and patient referrals increase. In summary, we reiterate our confidence in the long-term opportunity in TMTT and are passionate about the significant progress we\u2019re making in bringing solutions to these deadly diseases to improve patients\u2019 lives around the world. We continue to expect total TMTT sales this year to be $30 million to $45 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the second quarter of $161 million declined 25% on an underlying basis, primarily related to the impact of COVID-19. This was better than our expectations back in April. The ongoing adoption of TAVR also contributed to U.S. surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds. Despite the decline in Q2 sales, we are encouraged by the recovery of procedure demand as we progress through the quarter, increased and improved management of ICU capacity as well as prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals, continue to \u2013 contributed to rebounding case volumes in late Q2. We continue to be encouraged by the steady adoption of our most advanced resilient tissue technology in the Edwards portfolio. Our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic tissue valve grew in both new and existing sites in the U.S. and abroad, driven by increasing demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world and remains the number one implanted surgical aortic valve in the U.S. and Japan. We recently gained U.S. approval and treated our first patients with our second resilient offering, the preassembled, ready-to-implant KONECT RESILIA aortic valve conduit. KONECT combines our leading RESILIA surgical valve technology with a proven surgical graft. This combination allows for the treatment of complex patient anatomies where it\u2019s necessary to replace a valve and repair the ascending aorta. Elsewhere in the surgical structural heart portfolio, recently, the first commercial cases of a Harpoon were successfully completed in Europe. This beating heart mitral valve repair system offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients. In summary, we continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 will decline 5% to 15% in 2019. Localized hotspots could continue to limit hospital capacity, slow disease diagnosis and impact patient willingness to undergo treatment. However, our expectation is that the recovery experienced in late Q2 will extend in the U.S. and Europe into Q3. We continue to anticipate that in Q4, our sales will return to positive growth driven by the market adoption of our newest technologies. We\u2019re excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $164 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis. Increased demand for our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remains strong, but were not enough to offset the COVID-driven impact of delayed elective procedures. Soft global demand was also partially offset by large orders in Europe associated with ICU capacity increases. We also experienced a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continued to limit their capital spending as a result of COVID-19. Toward the end of the quarter, however, we started to see positive signs of recovery in demand for our products used in cardiac surgeries, while demand in products used in more elective surgeries remains depressed. We\u2019d also like to highlight the recently announced collaboration between our Critical Care team and the Anesthesia Quality Institute. The main focus of this shared initiative will be to improve data collection and analysis of intraoperative hypotension, which, according to research, is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We\u2019re optimistic this joint effort will result in the advancement of patient care through the use of enhanced data collection to create updated guidelines. In summary, we now estimate that Critical Care sales growth will be negative for 2020, largely due to anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., but still within our previous guidance of minus 5% to plus 5%. Before I turn it over to Scott, I\u2019d like to make one last comment. We realize it\u2019s difficult to predict the progression of COVID-19, including additional waves and isolated flare-ups and the associated impact on the health care system. We are planning on dealing with the ups and downs of this pandemic for the foreseeable future. Because of the severe condition of the patients we serve and our strong patient-focused team, I remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully deliver during this global crisis. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Michael. Today, I\u2019ll provide additional second quarter, along with some [Audio Dip]\nOperator: This is the operator. We can\u2019t hear Scott\u2019s voice coming through.\nScott Ullem: So let me start over again, just in case you missed that. Today, I\u2019m going to provide additional perspective on the second quarter, along with some indicators of how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold. Our sales performance in the second quarter was better than we expected because the trough was not as deep as we anticipated. April was the weakest month of the quarter, and we saw sequential improvements in May and June as hospital procedure volumes started to recover. Earnings were also stronger than we expected, both because of the stronger top line as well as because of constrained spending. We implemented cost control measures, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver an adjusted 25% operating profit margin and adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of $0.34, which was 26% below last year\u2019s second quarter. GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.20 as a result of the intellectual property agreement, which I will address in a few minutes. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today\u2019s release. And now I\u2019ll cover the details of our second quarter results as well as discuss guidance for the balance of the year. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4%, down from 76.4% in the prior year quarter. This year\u2019s rate included incremental costs associated with responding to COVID and a negative impact from foreign exchange. In the second half of the year, we expect to see a less pronounced impact from COVID on our gross margin compared to the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $275 million or 29.7% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This reduced spending resulted from COVID, which interrupted our planned flow of operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we did not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees nor to reduce investment plans supporting our long-term growth strategy. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $182 million or 19.7% of sales, compared to $192 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of high clinical spending in the prior year for PARTNER III continued access as well as for CENTERA, and pause clinical trial activity this year due to COVID. We expect R&D expenses to resume sequential growth in the second half of the year. As Mike mentioned, earlier this month, we were pleased to settle the TMTT intellectual property matter. This impacts our income statement as well as our cash flow statement. The principal impact to our P&L was a $368 million pretax charge in the second quarter. In addition, we will incur a total of approximately $100 million in royalty expenses between now and May 2024, which will be recorded in cost of sales. The cash flow impact includes a onetime $100 million payment to Abbott made earlier this month, along with quarterly payments in future years. Turning to taxes. We had negative earnings in the second quarter due to the special settlement charge. As a result, we reported a $46 million tax benefit in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of special items, our tax rate was 8.2% for the quarter. This unusually low rate included an approximate $20 million benefit or $0.03 per share from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The stock-based compensation benefit was in line with our expectation. We continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter sales growth by approximately 1.1% or $12 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $30 million negative impact or about 1.0% to full year 2020 sales versus 2019. FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share reflecting our effective currency hedging program. Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion. Our public bonds of approximately $600 million don\u2019t mature until 2028. Additionally, we continue to generate healthy cash flows. Average adjusted shares outstanding in the second quarter were $630 million on a post-split basis, and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to [indiscernible]. Recall that in June, we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a three-for-one stock split. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $123 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $231 million, less capital spending of $108 million. We are not updating our free cash flow guidance for the year, although we continue to expect that it will fall short of our original expectation of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Now, I\u2019ll turn to guidance for the full year 2020. Our guidance assumes that the worst of the COVID financial impact to Edwards is behind us and that we\u2019ll see a progressive recovery during the second half of the year, anticipating that we\u2019ll be dealing with ups and downs along the way. Remember that Edwards\u2019 sales grew 19% in the second half of 2019, so we have high year-over-year comparisons. Even so, we expect total sales in the third quarter to return to 2019 levels and for sales to start growing again in the fourth quarter. So while the second quarter sales decline was less severe than we expected, our expectations for the second half of the year haven\u2019t significantly changed from earlier guidance in April. We estimate total company sales growth for the full year to be approximately flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%. We now estimate TAVR growth to be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5% and Critical Care growth to be negative for 2020, but still within our previous guidance of minus 5% to plus 5%. Surgical growth remains in a range of minus 5% to minus 15% versus 2019, and we continue to expect that TMTT sales will be $30 million to $45 million. Full year sales guidance for the total company continues to be $4 billion to $4.5 billion. And for the third quarter, we estimate sales of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $1.75 to $1.95 on a post-split basis, up 11% from our previous guidance of $1.58 to $1.75, or on a pre-split basis, $4.75 to $5.25. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by, once again, expressing our gratitude to our clinician partners in the global health care community for their tireless dedication to serving patients during this challenging time. We appreciate their strong leadership and brave commitment to patient care, and we\u2019re dedicated to supporting them as they address this global health crisis. I also want to recognize the extraordinary actions that our employees around the world have taken to overcome the unique challenges associated with COVID-19. Edwards is proud to be a member of a critical health care infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re ready to take questions now. [Operator Instructions] Diego?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good afternoon. It\u2019s great to see how effectively you\u2019ve navigated through the pandemic. Maybe I could just start with two questions on TAVR. First, taking your U.S. TAVR and European TAVR results and matching against our assumptions for the April and May decline. It seems that those units may have already returned to growth in June. Did the U.S. or EU TAVR businesses return to growth in June or even in the first weeks of July here?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. In general, we\u2019d rather not get into the week-to-week and month-to-month expectations. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the steady improvement in procedures across all of our businesses that we progressed through Q2. The specifics on June sales are not likely to be as helpful, as they probably include working down some backlog in addition to new patient screenings. So \u2013 and as we said, based on how we\u2019ve begun Q3, we continue to expect sales in Q3 to be approximately flat to our pretty strong 2019 Q3 and the Q4 is going to transition to growth over 2019.\nJosh Jennings: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, it would be great to get any data points that you can share regarding those two elements you just talked about in terms \u2013 it might be important for the pace of recovery from here. First, where do you think centers are in terms of working through the COVID-19-induced TAVR backlog? And then second, are you seeing evidence that new patient screenings in the referral channel is revving back up in step with the TAVR case volumes? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike Mussallem: Sure. Thanks, Josh. So we\u2019ve heard anecdotally of many centers who have already worked off their COVID-driven backlog. And as you may know, some centers operate with no backlog at all. The reason that some of the backlogs didn\u2019t grow is that when treatment stopped, so did screening. Now this isn\u2019t true all over the world. We know of some centers outside the U.S. where the waiting lists have gotten longer, and they\u2019re likely to get worked down over 2020. But in the U.S., we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s much of a backlog at this point. And unfortunately, due to the deadly nature of severe AS, some of these patients who delayed treatment may never be treated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Mike, just maybe one more specific one on TAVR and a follow-up on mitral. Just in terms of this recent resurgence, I think investors are very focused on the specific areas, Texas and Florida, and the age of these patients, has there been any sense in your mind in the month of July or late June, specifically in July, that this resurgence in some of these key geographic markets, has that had any impact on trends here in July?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, we have heard anecdotally of cases being canceled in places like Texas and Florida and some of the southern states. But then again, as we mentioned, we had a chance to sort of see how Q2 finished and see how Q3 started. And that\u2019s kind of built into our guidance. We anticipated there were going to be some levels of ups and downs. And so when we project the Q3 that we think is approximately flat to 2019, it takes that into account.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then as it relates to TMTT, with the lawsuit resolved and I know you kind of reiterated your TMTT guidance for the year, but if I could, with the lawsuit resolved, does the PASCAL strategy ex U.S. change in anyway, as it relates to either the spending associated with the launch, the breadth of the launch or the pricing of the valve in ex U.S. markets? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, David. No, broadly, there\u2019s no change in the strategy. We continue to have a lot of confidence in this platform. We will continue to offer at a premium price. We\u2019re very pleased with the way it\u2019s been performing, and we were happy to see that 1,200 patient experience reported at the virtual EuroPCR. One of the reasons why there\u2019s no real changes, we really try and focus on great outcomes, and so we\u2019re very deliberate about training center by center across Europe as we implement. And so you can see more of a continuation of what you\u2019ve seen in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nMike Mussallem: Bob, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit.\nOperator: We can\u2019t hear Mr. Hopkins. Please reconnect.\nMark Wilterding: Go ahead, Diego, we\u2019re on the same page.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much for taking the question. So one, if you could, just on you mentioned rebuilding the pipeline and sort of improving clinic visits. And I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the role that some of the newer technology investments that you made over the last couple of years and partnerships with some of the technology companies that have fit into this sort of telemedicine model, either CardioCare or Eko? Maybe talk about the role that they\u2019re playing, if any any, at this point in helping to close that gap? And then I had one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, the newest technologies are not quite ready to have a broad impact. But one of the things we\u2019ve seen is an incredible amount of agility and creativity on the part of the heart teams to make things happen. I mean, obviously, we tried to support them along the way. But they just pivoted. They find ways to get patients in. They found ways to bring patients to a safe place, to do a work up. They found ways to do some things virtually that they had always done in person. So it was remarkable to us to observe sort of a pivot on their part to make it happen.\nMatt Miksic: Okay. So a little more hustle maybe to get that done, it sounds like, for now anyway. And then the other is, you gave some color on the number of centers performing TAVR procedures. I\u2019m wondering given that new center growth has been such a big part of this market over the past several years, if you could talk a little bit about maybe the way in which some of the new centers are responding or staying in on trend, on pace, how they\u2019re being affected, if differently than some of the larger academic centers and how you expect to \u2013 that to kind of play out as we get further into the recovery?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Matt. So things have been very different by region of the world and certainly, region of the country. In terms of the new centers, they didn\u2019t have a tremendous impact on the second quarter. Most of it came from centers that were already in place. And again, we\u2019ve had a chance to spend time with a number of hospital CEOs, and we\u2019ve been impressed that they just set their mind to trying to make a pivot and be able to treat structural heart, in particular AS patients, during this time. So I think the last time that we addressed it, Matt, we said there were about 700 U.S. centers and that we were headed toward 850. I think COVID does slow that down some. So it will continue, but it wasn\u2019t a big part of the story in this quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Can you hear me okay? \nMike Mussallem: Yes, we hear you fine, Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Sorry. I apologize if I missed this, given I was in transition, but just a quick question on the fourth quarter guidance. I realize there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. You said you\u2019d return to growth. I\u2019m just curious, are you comfortable with where the Street is, at around 8% growth. Just trying to understand what\u2019s implicit in the guide?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Bob, you know what we\u2019re dealing with right now. There\u2019s so much uncertainty associated with the progression of COVID. It\u2019s very difficult. We\u2019re being somewhat courageous here to offer guidance at this point, with the uncertainty in front of us. So we\u2019re not ready to dial-in to anything very specific. We do have the confidence to say \u2013 no, we really believe we\u2019re going to be in growth mode, but we\u2019re not prepared to get that precise.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. And then just one question on China. Just curious, how you\u2019re thinking about the ramp in TAVR in China. If you could maybe talk about how you think about the market opportunity? And especially how much of an infrastructure do you think exists in China and how big an opportunity you think that could be over the next 12 months? Obviously, a nice opportunity long term, but just curious about the ramp.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Bob. We\u2019re really looking forward to launching in China. Our belief is that there were maybe, I don\u2019t know, 2,400, 2,500 cases performed in 2019. So a nice opportunity. And it\u2019s been served almost exclusive \u2013 or not almost, but exclusively by local companies. We\u2019re going to come in with a very different kind of approach, where we really focus on outstanding outcomes. We\u2019re going to try and really service those accounts. We\u2019re going to try and train them and make sure that they have great proctoring and support along the way. So we\u2019re not expecting this to be a fast start. Matter of fact, it will be slow and deliberate. We don\u2019t expect it to have an appreciable difference on our 2020 performance, but we really like what it could do on a long-term basis.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about global pricing and competition for a minute. I know you said your ASP globally was stable. Are you seeing any of your competitors or are you, going forward, pursuing any major changes to pricing or strategy that you\u2019re seeing?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. I can\u2019t say, Robbie, that we\u2019ve seen anything that\u2019s major during the quarter. So we feel like much of it has been somewhat consistent to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. We continue to be very disciplined ourselves. I\u2019m not positive exactly what other competitors are doing, but I haven\u2019t heard anything that\u2019s particularly noteworthy.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Congrats on getting the bicuspid warning \u2013 or not warning, but a negative suggestion removed from the label. How should we think about that in helping your adoption in low-risk here, where it is more important?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. So I think sometimes there was a misconception. We were never contraindicated. There was just always this notion that we didn\u2019t have the data that demonstrated safety. So now with the data that\u2019s been submitted, we\u2019re in a position there\u2019s no longer that safety concern. I don\u2019t know if it makes a big difference. We have routinely treated these patients right along. And so it\u2019s a positive for patients. We\u2019re not expecting it to have a big difference on our future volumes.\nRobbie Marcus: I appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on TAVR, Mike, one on TMTT. So Mike, early on, you talked about doctors adapting to COVID. And given the shorter length of stay with TAVR, do you see COVID accelerating the transition to TAVR from SAVR? And I had one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: No. Thanks, Larry. Yes, no, we really don\u2019t see that. You probably imagine what would be going on in 2020, if it wasn\u2019t for COVID, we would be enjoying, we think, some pretty hefty double-digit growth rates. And so no, COVID\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t see it as an accelerator, but we\u2019ve been so impressed by the ability of the system to adapt and find ways of treating COVID patients and their AS patients.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks. And Mike, I didn\u2019t hear you reiterate the $3 billion TMTT market in 2024. I apologize if I missed that. But is that \u2013 did you not reiterate it? And is the market developing slower than you expected? Or is just COVID may be pushing that $3 billion market size out a year or so? Thanks for taking my question.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Larry. We\u2019re not prepared to update how big we think the TMTT market is in 2024. You can tell we continue to be really excited about it. We wouldn\u2019t be putting this kind of energy into it, if we didn\u2019t think it was a big opportunity by 2024. And that\u2019s just the beginning, it\u2019s going to get much bigger beyond that. But you\u2019d have to say that given it\u2019s a developing market and it needs clinical trials for it to develop that COVID is somewhat of a setback. We\u2019ll see what it is. We\u2019re hoping that it\u2019s pretty contained but we\u2019re not prepared to update any thinking at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question.\nMatt Taylor: I just had a follow-up on the prior question about adding centers. I mean, could you just give us any color on how many centers have been added in the recent period? Are you able to do that? Or are hospitals really focused on managing patients and managing COVID. Can you talk about when that will resume?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I don\u2019t know the number, but my \u2013 I would say it\u2019s really low. I don\u2019t think that new centers were trying to do TAVR during the onset of a global pandemic. I mean it just wasn\u2019t there. So it wasn\u2019t really much of a factor. There may have been a few that I\u2019m not aware of, but I think it was an obstacle for people to start to add bigger issues.\nMatt Taylor: And just related to this a little bit, is the idea that as an incumbent and a market leader, does that give you an advantage during the COVID period because doctors don\u2019t want to train on new things or necessarily fuss with new or less-proven things or smaller companies?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, there may have been some advantage that we\u2019re the incumbent. But maybe the bigger issue is that we\u2019ve got some really trustworthy and proven results. We\u2019ve got \u2013 people can count on the SAPIEN platform in terms of how it\u2019s going to perform. They don\u2019t have to worry so much about a pacemaker that\u2019s going to mean the patient has to stay in the hospital longer, very little chance of ICU. So they just have more confidence in the system. And frankly, there\u2019s just not many opportunities if you have something brand-new to be able to train centers. And so there is some advantage, but I almost think the bigger advantage is from having a reliable system.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nRaj Denhoy: Thanks and good evening. Maybe I can start with Scott on the SG&A spending in the quarter. It was down almost, I guess, almost $40 million from last year. I know you didn\u2019t purposely cut a lot of expenses in the quarter. And I\u2019m curious about whether we should think about this as kind of a sustained level of expense at this point. Are there going to be changes in the way that you go-to-market now and given the access to hospitals? Will there be any sort of permanent change to the expense level for you guys?\nScott Ullem: Probably nothing material. I mean, we\u2019re learning a lot about how to operate in this environment, but we\u2019re expecting that the flow of operating expenses is probably going to start to increase again as our sales increase.\nRaj Denhoy: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe one for Mike. I\u2019m just curious your thoughts on \u2013 given that TAVR is in such an elderly population, do you think there\u2019s going to be any protracted impact on patients\u2019 willingness to go to the hospital [Audio Dip] longer to get to a more normalized level of demand for TAVR? Or do you think will snap back relatively quickly?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve actually been wondering that. And we spend a lot of time with people across the health care system that worry about how do you get patients to reengage and come back to the hospitals. Hospitals have really worked on it, and they try and provide a safe place. They\u2019re encouraging direct contact with the physician. But the one thing that we know about AS, it is a deadly disease. It\u2019s just got a lousy future. And so those patients are highly incented to enter the system. And I guess we\u2019re kind of learning like everybody else. We saw a rebound much faster in May and June than we were expecting.\nRaj Denhoy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please state your question.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Mike, a couple of quick ones on the mitral and tricuspid programs. Is the plan still to develop EVOQUE for mitral? Or is that becoming more of a tricuspid system? And then any update on Cardioband?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. We\u2019re very excited about starting this EVOQUE trial in the tricuspid position. It really turns out to be a great platform. It is a platform that can be used in mitral. We have decided that we were going to advance M3 first, as the first platform for mitral regurgitation. We still like EVOQUE. And it may have a role, but we\u2019re going to have EVOQUE lead in the tricuspid position and M3 lead in the mitral position.\nChris Pasquale: And anything new on Cardioband?\nMike Mussallem: We continue to do cases in Cardioband. Most of them get done in the tricuspid position, and we\u2019re very pleased with the positive clinical outcomes. It\u2019s not broadly adopted, but for those that are engaged in it, they\u2019re quite happy and the procedure times are coming down. We are really focused on updating that design. To be able to be one that is more easily used by many other clinicians and can lead to shorter times and more effective procedures. So that\u2019s also a key priority for the company.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a good execution to you. Mike, I had one clinical and one financial, maybe on the clinical side. I think I heard this correct, EVOQUE tricuspid, that\u2019s a transfemoral approach, correct? And does it imply the SAPIEN M3 \u2013 is that also a transfemoral approach, do I need to have?\nMike Mussallem: So the second part of the question, if you can just \u2013 can you just say it again, please, Vijay?\nVijay Kumar: On the SAPIEN M3\u2026\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Yes. So the M3 and EVOQUE systems are both transfemoral, right? So if that really gets at it, yes. So we think that they are \u2013 they have the opportunity here to be adopted, if we can demonstrate strong evidence.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s wonderful. And let\u2019s say, transformal on the arterial, not the venous side, correct, Mike?\nMike Mussallem: So on the mitral side, you were going to be coming up the venous side, right? So the transfemoral for MR is \u2013 and so also \u2013 so if you will, we come across the septum in the case of the mitral valve, whereas become transfemoral for the tricuspid valve.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful, Mike. That\u2019s great to hear, see that approach. Just one, Scott, quick one on the guidance here. For CAGR at the high end, it implies mid-single digits for the back half. You guys said mid-singles in first half, 3Q at the midpoint, the guide is for flattish. That would imply double-digit for Q4. Is that something Q4, assuming we don\u2019t have a second wave, that\u2019s something that you guys are comfortable with? Thank you.\nScott Ullem: Well, like I said, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re expecting there are going to be some ups and downs here in the third and the fourth quarter. But with some kind of risk adjustment to factor in, little flare ups that may happen, we do expect that the high end is probably the right way to pencil in TAVR for the full year, largely as a result of the overperformance in the second quarter, less as a result of our expectations for Q3 and Q4 having really changed much since April.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nPito Chickering: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Back to Bob\u2019s question on China. I understand the ramp will be slow here. But can you guys size what the market opportunity is for three to five years from now in China?\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Pito. It\u2019s hard for us to know. And let me tell you why, and we\u2019re not trying to be evasive here. We\u2019re going into a market where it\u2019s the individual pays, it\u2019s private pay. It comes out of their pocket. And so our experiences in other places of the world are just not as applicable. We also are going into a market where there\u2019s local competitors, and they were local first. So it\u2019s not clear to us how fast it\u2019s going to develop and how big it\u2019s going to be. We think there is a lot of disease, and we think there are a lot of people that will be interested in a first-class system to get their disease treated, but we\u2019re just not able to size it yet.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. It\u2019s been a pretty challenging quarter for obvious reasons. But can you give us any color on what your TAVR market share was in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And is the performance from Ultra driving any market share gains? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Pito. During this difficult time, it\u2019s really tough for us to know what market share is. So just know how fast the market grew is something we\u2019re just not comfortable to talk about. The data is lagging, it\u2019s incomplete, and we just don\u2019t have a clear picture.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon. Thank you for delivering this quarter. Two quick questions. I may have missed it. Can you talk about what percentage of revenue your run rate was as you exited the quarter?\nMike Mussallem: So say it again, Joanne, please?\nJoanne Wuensch: What percentage of revenue your run rate was as you exited the quarter?\nMike Mussallem: You mean what was \u2013 what did we exit as a growth rate?\nJoanne Wuensch: Or as your year-over-year, how you think about it? Or your growth rate? I\u2019m just trying to understand your jumping-off point.\nScott Ullem: Well, I could say for this, Joanne, I think if this is your question, in the U.S., our TAVR business declined in the low teens in the second quarter. Is that where you were going?\nJoanne Wuensch: I\u2019m trying to get a little bit more granular as you exited the quarter, not just for the full quarter.\nScott Ullem: Go ahead, Mike.\nMike Mussallem: No, we\u2019re just saying, Joanne, we don\u2019t feel comfortable that the exit rate is a good proxy for the rest of the year. Remember, probably some of the cases that we were doing in June were probably catch-up from what was postponed in \u2013 earlier in the quarter. And so probably not an ideal way to be able to do modeling. We\u2019ve tried to share with you our best estimate, and we\u2019ve even included how we started the third quarter and say, based on that, this is how we think Q3 is going to go, and we think it\u2019s likely to be flat. But the exit rate, although interesting, is probably not the best measure.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question has to do a little bit with clinical trial enrollment. I mean, could you just provide a little bit of color how people are beginning to reengage and bring patients into the enrollment process?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne. So what we were pleased with is we saw a willingness on the part of centers to get back involved. And I think we shared a 50% number. So about 50% of the people in the class trials that we said, hey, we\u2019re pausing, have already approached us and said, we\u2019re ready to go. Now from when they\u2019re ready to go to when they\u2019re actually treating patients, takes some time. There\u2019s actually a much smaller number of those centers that have actually treated patients. But they\u2019re coming back. So it\u2019s going to cost us time, Joanne, clearly, on these clinical trials. It will \u2013 yet to be seen, whether it\u2019s two quarters, more or less, I don\u2019t know. But there clearly is some kind of a pause and it will be somewhat dependent on the progression \u2013 precaution of COVID-19.\nJoanne Wuensch: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question from today comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please state your question.\nRick Wise: Thanks and good afternoon, Mike and Scott. Mike, I wanted to turn back to the IP agreement settlement. And maybe you could just expand a little bit. I\u2019m just curious if you could expand a little bit on the implications. With the agreement in hand, maybe talk to us a little bit about what you can do now that you felt uncomfortable tackling before? What does it free you to do either clinically marketing, just help us appreciate next steps there? And just when I think about over the few decades, honestly, and these kinds of agreements, it\u2019s often been a positive for the company signing it because the bar is raised on competition, et cetera. So what are the implications, the broader implications? It\u2019s nice to have it done. I get that part.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Rick. We\u2019re passionate about this whole area of being able to help these mitral and tricuspid patients. When you\u2019re involved in a lawsuit, it just consumes a lot of energy. And not only consumes the energy of the legal team, but it pulls much of the senior team into it, it pulls our field teams into it, it pulls our R&D teams into it. And it\u2019s just a distraction. Instead of having people focused on how can I do great things for patients? How do I advance this therapy? You\u2019re involved in some kind of a chess match. So it\u2019s a real joy for us to say that, that time-consuming distraction is gone and we can focus on the exciting innovations that help patients that are suffering from valve disease.\nRick Wise: And just last, briefly, I know this is not about next quarter, the second half, but just \u2013 I\u2019m always curious to hear your latest thinking on new indications, TAVR indications. We\u2019ve touched on bicuspid a little bit, but anything incremental on asymptomatic or moderate AS to share? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Rick. Yes, those are \u2013 those continue to be very important. You can imagine, things like early TAVR, where you kind of slow down a little bit when you go through something like COVID, but we are \u2013 continue to be passionate about being able to treat asymptomatic patients, and we\u2019re optimistic about that. And we also really want to get after these moderate patients. We continue to do a lot of thinking about that. We\u2019re not ready with a clinical trial design because that will be a very important one. But that\u2019s one that\u2019s clearly on our radar screen that we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate.\nRick Wise: Thanks, Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone. And so I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Michael. Today, I'll provide additional second quarter, along with some [Audio Dip] So let me start over again, just in case you missed that. Today, I'm going to provide additional perspective on the second quarter, along with some indicators of how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold. Our sales performance in the second quarter was better than we expected because the trough was not as deep as we anticipated. April was the weakest month of the quarter, and we saw sequential improvements in May and June as hospital procedure volumes started to recover. Earnings were also stronger than we expected, both because of the stronger top line as well as because of constrained spending. We implemented cost control measures, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver an adjusted 25% operating profit margin and adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of $0.34, which was 26% below last year's second quarter. GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.20 as a result of the intellectual property agreement, which I will address in a few minutes. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. And now I'll cover the details of our second quarter results as well as discuss guidance for the balance of the year. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4%, down from 76.4% in the prior year quarter. This year's rate included incremental costs associated with responding to COVID and a negative impact from foreign exchange. In the second half of the year, we expect to see a less pronounced impact from COVID on our gross margin compared to the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $275 million or 29.7% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This reduced spending resulted from COVID, which interrupted our planned flow of operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we did not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees nor to reduce investment plans supporting our long-term growth strategy. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $182 million or 19.7% of sales, compared to $192 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of high clinical spending in the prior year for PARTNER III continued access as well as for CENTERA, and pause clinical trial activity this year due to COVID. We expect R&D expenses to resume sequential growth in the second half of the year. As Mike mentioned, earlier this month, we were pleased to settle the TMTT intellectual property matter. This impacts our income statement as well as our cash flow statement. The principal impact to our P&L was a $368 million pretax charge in the second quarter. In addition, we will incur a total of approximately $100 million in royalty expenses between now and May 2024, which will be recorded in cost of sales. The cash flow impact includes a onetime $100 million payment to Abbott made earlier this month, along with quarterly payments in future years. Turning to taxes. We had negative earnings in the second quarter due to the special settlement charge. As a result, we reported a $46 million tax benefit in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of special items, our tax rate was 8.2% for the quarter. This unusually low rate included an approximate $20 million benefit or $0.03 per share from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The stock-based compensation benefit was in line with our expectation. We continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter sales growth by approximately 1.1% or $12 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $30 million negative impact or about 1.0% to full year 2020 sales versus 2019. FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share reflecting our effective currency hedging program. Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion. Our public bonds of approximately $600 million don't mature until 2028. Additionally, we continue to generate healthy cash flows. Average adjusted shares outstanding in the second quarter were $630 million on a post-split basis, and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to [indiscernible]. Recall that in June, we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a three-for-one stock split. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $123 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $231 million, less capital spending of $108 million. We are not updating our free cash flow guidance for the year, although we continue to expect that it will fall short of our original expectation of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Now, I'll turn to guidance for the full year 2020. Our guidance assumes that the worst of the COVID financial impact to Edwards is behind us and that we'll see a progressive recovery during the second half of the year, anticipating that we'll be dealing with ups and downs along the way. Remember that Edwards' sales grew 19% in the second half of 2019, so we have high year-over-year comparisons. Even so, we expect total sales in the third quarter to return to 2019 levels and for sales to start growing again in the fourth quarter. So while the second quarter sales decline was less severe than we expected, our expectations for the second half of the year haven't significantly changed from earlier guidance in April. We estimate total company sales growth for the full year to be approximately flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%. We now estimate TAVR growth to be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5% and Critical Care growth to be negative for 2020, but still within our previous guidance of minus 5% to plus 5%. Surgical growth remains in a range of minus 5% to minus 15% versus 2019, and we continue to expect that TMTT sales will be $30 million to $45 million. Full year sales guidance for the total company continues to be $4 billion to $4.5 billion. And for the third quarter, we estimate sales of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $1.75 to $1.95 on a post-split basis, up 11% from our previous guidance of $1.58 to $1.75, or on a pre-split basis, $4.75 to $5.25. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike. Probably nothing material. I mean, we're learning a lot about how to operate in this environment, but we're expecting that the flow of operating expenses is probably going to start to increase again as our sales increase. Well, like I said, we're not \u2013 we're expecting there are going to be some ups and downs here in the third and the fourth quarter. But with some kind of risk adjustment to factor in, little flare ups that may happen, we do expect that the high end is probably the right way to pencil in TAVR for the full year, largely as a result of the overperformance in the second quarter, less as a result of our expectations for Q3 and Q4 having really changed much since April. Well, I could say for this, Joanne, I think if this is your question, in the U.S., our TAVR business declined in the low teens in the second quarter. Is that where you were going? Go ahead, Mike."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Before we get into the specifics of the second quarter, I'd like to make a few comments on the overall environment and how Edwards is striving to deliver during these challenging times. There's no question that the world has changed considerably as a result of the COVID pandemic. However, some things haven't changed, most importantly, our patient-focused strategy and our aspirations as a company. At Edwards, our dedication to providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease remains central to our credo. Our aspiration to excel as a trusted partner and to foster an inclusive culture where all employees grow and thrive is stronger than ever. And our desire to improve access to our therapies for underserved and undertreated patient populations around the world motivates our 14,000 employees every day. An unfortunate consequence of the intense focus of the pandemic during the first few months was that many patients, like those with structural heart disease were not treated. One interesting published source highlighted how the COVID-19 surge in March and April overwhelmed Dutch hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. In this study, they estimated there were more \u2013 there were approximately 10x more healthy life years lost from regular care not being delivered compared to COVID life years lost during that period. Closer to home in the U.S., recall that the data published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery suggests that patients waiting for aortic valve replacement had a 4% mortality at one month, 8% at three months and 12% after waiting six months. The provider community is aggressively and creatively adapting to be able to treat COVID patients, while at the same time, providing the necessary care to patients with life-threatening underlying conditions. We'd like to thank all the health care providers on the frontline who've had to face the challenges of COVID-19 without a road map. And who have made difficult decisions and innovate at the same time to provide the necessary quality of care for patients in need. While the number of COVID cases remains a priority for providers, we observed already in Q2, providers are adapting to ensure treatment of their structural heart patients. As alarming as COVID is, AS remains a deadly disease and treatment delays will inevitably result in increased mortality for a condition which has proven therapies with excellent clinical outcomes in the case of TAVR, also minimal use of hospital resources. Even with the heroic efforts of the health care community, we know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients we serve as they continue to weigh the risks of COVID-19 against the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Edwards is committed to providing the opportunity for faster procedures, shorter hospital stays and exceptional patient outcomes. Irrespective of the unpredictable surges of this deadly pandemic, there is a growing recognition that valve therapy should not be postponed. Not all procedures are the same. Valve replacement therapy is less elective, and these patients have a more urgent need. We have found ourselves more aligned than ever with the interest of patients and providers during this challenging time. Now turning to the second quarter. Despite challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, we're pleased to report much better-than-expected second quarter results. Sales of $925 million exceeded the top end of our April guidance of $700 million to $900 million, driven by the continued adoption of our life-saving technologies around the world. This performance was made possible by our dedicated team, which includes our committed field organization and our global supply chain. Sales were balanced across all major geographies and benefited from improving month-to-month trends as we progressed through the second quarter. We also started to gradually resume patient enrollment in clinical trials that were slowed at the end of the first quarter, and we're working with additional centers as many are now ready to reengage. Furthermore, at TVT Connect and the virtual EuroPCR last month, we highlighted positive clinical results in multiple breakthrough therapies. Even though many on our team were working remotely during Q2, we made positive progress on a number of very important new technology milestones that will be detailed later in our comments. Finally, we were pleased for recently announced intellectual property agreement, which allows us to fully dedicate time and resources to helping patients. In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $594 million declined 11% on an underlying basis. Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise pricing discipline. As noted on our first quarter call, sales were severely depressed in April as provider turned their attention to the pandemic response. However, we were encouraged by the steady improvement in procedure volumes throughout May and June when approximately 90% of our active sites performed TAVR cases. This is a testament to the dedicated heart teams and our committed clinical field teams. We hear from a number of clinicians that new patients are increasingly entering the system as they seek treatment for severe aortic stenosis. We've seen a significant improvement from the steep trough in April. To put things in perspective, during the second quarter in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic, there were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN technology. In the U.S., our TAVR sales declined in the low teens versus last year. As expected, April marked the most severe month year-over-year. U.S. TAVR sales declines and procedure rates remained highly variable across the country. In the last week of April, we observed the first signs of recovery and in May and June, we experienced a significant step-up in procedure volumes as previously screened patients who temporarily delayed treatment, began to return. Recently, we submitted additional data supporting the safety of our SAPIEN 3 platform in bicuspid patients. And based on these data, FDA has approved the removal of the precaution from the labeling. Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our TAVR sales declined in the high single digits year-over-year on an underlying basis. In Europe, the pace of recovery was faster than expected despite difficult early headwinds from COVID-19. In Japan, second quarter procedures were less impacted by COVID-19 than initially expected. Aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease in that region where Edwards is very focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. It's also worth noting recent TAVR approvals outside the U.S., last month in China, Edwards received regulatory approval to begin treating patients suffering from severe AS and at high-risk for open heart surgery with SAPIEN 3. We look forward to partnering with hospitals throughout China to introduce this therapy. Earlier this month, Australia joined the list of countries that approved our SAPIEN platform for treatment of severe AS patients, independent of their risk score. We believe these approvals represent important milestones for patients outside the U.S. Now shifting gears to our latest TAVR innovation, SAPIEN 3 Ultra, clinical feedback on improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Last month, at the virtual TVT Connect conference, a propensity matched analysis of 1,300 patients was presented using data from the TBT registry to compare outcomes of patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and SAPIEN 3 valves. This was the largest analysis of TAVR outcomes with Ultra, to date. Both valves demonstrated outstanding outcomes for paravalvular leak, with Ultra redefining the benchmark for transcatheter heart valve technologies moving forward. This analysis indicated that 90% of the patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra had no reported paravalvular leak at discharge. We are also very encouraged by additional data in the study, which confirm SAPIEN's ability to facilitate a more expedited in-hospital experience for patients. This included fewer ICU stays, with over 40% of the patients requiring no ICU time at all and shorter total hospital lengths of stay with approximately 50% of patients discharged within 24 hours and 80% by 48 hours. In Q2, Ultra accounted for approximately 40% of our U.S. and European TAVR volumes, up from 30% at the end of the first quarter. You'll recall that we temporarily paused SAPIEN 3 Ultra proctoring at centers that were not already trained on the device, and we resumed training in the second quarter. In summary, while the sharp decline in April was not as prolonged as we expected, we continue to envision a second half similar to our April expectations. Although there continues to be a high level of site-to-site variability, based on our second quarter performance, we now anticipate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 will be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%. Based on how we've begun the third quarter, we continue to expect in the third quarter \u2013 we continue to expect sales in the third quarter to be approximately flat to our strong 2019 third quarter and a fourth quarter that transitions to growth over 2019. Furthermore, as patients and clinicians increasingly choose TAVR, we remain confident that the opportunity will grow to over $7 billion by 2024. Turning to TMTT, which is the transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies for patients suffering from diseases of these heart valves. In the mitral position, we're developing repair therapies with PASCAL and Cardioband as well as replacement therapies with M3 and EVOQUE. In the tricuspid position, we're pursuing the PASCAL and Cardioband repair therapies and today, we are announcing a pivotal trial of EVOQUE for tricuspid valve replacement. We have early commercial sales in Europe with several of these therapies and we're advancing each of these platforms, including five pivotal studies underway in the U.S. We continue to be very pleased with our robust, real-world evidence with PASCAL mitral repair, as highlighted during a presentation at virtual EuroPCR. The analysis of more than 1,200 commercially treated patients demonstrated an excellent safety profile and confirm that significant reduction of mitral regurgitation can be achieved after only a short learning curve for physicians. As previously announced, we're pleased to have received CE mark for PASCAL repair system for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation. Based on our early and positive class tricuspid EFS data, we have initiated an introduction in Europe with a focus on excellent outcome for this new tricuspid repair therapy. Last quarter, we announced a temporary pause of new enrollments for our active mitral and tricuspid pivotal clinical trials. In consultation with investigators and hospitals, more than half of our trial sites have begun \u2013 have been reactivated and are beginning to treat patients. We anticipate enrollment in our three class studies will continue to ramp in the third and fourth quarter, and we're still targeting U.S. approval of PASCAL DMR in 2022. Now turning to replacement therapies. We're encouraged by the early clinical experience with EVOQUE tricuspid in 25 patients recently presented by Dr. Neil Fam, which demonstrated 100%, 30-day survival as well as very significant acute reduction of tricuspid regurgitation and improvement in functional status. We're pleased to announce that we've received approval to initiate a pivotal study for the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system, which is designed to gain U.S. approval and has breakthrough device designation from the FDA. The TRISCEND II study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the EVOQUE system compared to optimal medical therapy in patients with severe TR. In mitral replacement, we continue to gain experience with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE. Both systems utilize a transfemoral delivery approach. We are encouraged by the early experience with EVOQUE in patients with severe MR and high surgical risk. Additionally, we anticipate enrollment in our SAPIEN M3 pivotal trial to begin by the end of the year. Second quarter global sales for TMTT were $6 million. We expect to progressively ramp in Q3 and Q4, and as we activate more centers in Europe and they resume procedures and patient referrals increase. In summary, we reiterate our confidence in the long-term opportunity in TMTT and are passionate about the significant progress we're making in bringing solutions to these deadly diseases to improve patients' lives around the world. We continue to expect total TMTT sales this year to be $30 million to $45 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the second quarter of $161 million declined 25% on an underlying basis, primarily related to the impact of COVID-19. This was better than our expectations back in April. The ongoing adoption of TAVR also contributed to U.S. surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds. Despite the decline in Q2 sales, we are encouraged by the recovery of procedure demand as we progress through the quarter, increased and improved management of ICU capacity as well as prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals, continue to \u2013 contributed to rebounding case volumes in late Q2. We continue to be encouraged by the steady adoption of our most advanced resilient tissue technology in the Edwards portfolio. Our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic tissue valve grew in both new and existing sites in the U.S. and abroad, driven by increasing demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world and remains the number one implanted surgical aortic valve in the U.S. and Japan. We recently gained U.S. approval and treated our first patients with our second resilient offering, the preassembled, ready-to-implant KONECT RESILIA aortic valve conduit. KONECT combines our leading RESILIA surgical valve technology with a proven surgical graft. This combination allows for the treatment of complex patient anatomies where it's necessary to replace a valve and repair the ascending aorta. Elsewhere in the surgical structural heart portfolio, recently, the first commercial cases of a Harpoon were successfully completed in Europe. This beating heart mitral valve repair system offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients. In summary, we continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 will decline 5% to 15% in 2019. Localized hotspots could continue to limit hospital capacity, slow disease diagnosis and impact patient willingness to undergo treatment. However, our expectation is that the recovery experienced in late Q2 will extend in the U.S. and Europe into Q3. We continue to anticipate that in Q4, our sales will return to positive growth driven by the market adoption of our newest technologies. We're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $164 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis. Increased demand for our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remains strong, but were not enough to offset the COVID-driven impact of delayed elective procedures. Soft global demand was also partially offset by large orders in Europe associated with ICU capacity increases. We also experienced a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continued to limit their capital spending as a result of COVID-19. Toward the end of the quarter, however, we started to see positive signs of recovery in demand for our products used in cardiac surgeries, while demand in products used in more elective surgeries remains depressed. We'd also like to highlight the recently announced collaboration between our Critical Care team and the Anesthesia Quality Institute. The main focus of this shared initiative will be to improve data collection and analysis of intraoperative hypotension, which, according to research, is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We're optimistic this joint effort will result in the advancement of patient care through the use of enhanced data collection to create updated guidelines. In summary, we now estimate that Critical Care sales growth will be negative for 2020, largely due to anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., but still within our previous guidance of minus 5% to plus 5%. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to make one last comment. We realize it's difficult to predict the progression of COVID-19, including additional waves and isolated flare-ups and the associated impact on the health care system. We are planning on dealing with the ups and downs of this pandemic for the foreseeable future. Because of the severe condition of the patients we serve and our strong patient-focused team, I remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully deliver during this global crisis. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by, once again, expressing our gratitude to our clinician partners in the global health care community for their tireless dedication to serving patients during this challenging time. We appreciate their strong leadership and brave commitment to patient care, and we're dedicated to supporting them as they address this global health crisis. I also want to recognize the extraordinary actions that our employees around the world have taken to overcome the unique challenges associated with COVID-19. Edwards is proud to be a member of a critical health care infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. In general, we'd rather not get into the week-to-week and month-to-month expectations. We've been encouraged by the steady improvement in procedures across all of our businesses that we progressed through Q2. The specifics on June sales are not likely to be as helpful, as they probably include working down some backlog in addition to new patient screenings. So \u2013 and as we said, based on how we've begun Q3, we continue to expect sales in Q3 to be approximately flat to our pretty strong 2019 Q3 and the Q4 is going to transition to growth over 2019. Sure. Thanks, Josh. So we've heard anecdotally of many centers who have already worked off their COVID-driven backlog. And as you may know, some centers operate with no backlog at all. The reason that some of the backlogs didn't grow is that when treatment stopped, so did screening. Now this isn't true all over the world. We know of some centers outside the U.S. where the waiting lists have gotten longer, and they're likely to get worked down over 2020. But in the U.S., we don't think that there's much of a backlog at this point. And unfortunately, due to the deadly nature of severe AS, some of these patients who delayed treatment may never be treated. Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, we have heard anecdotally of cases being canceled in places like Texas and Florida and some of the southern states. But then again, as we mentioned, we had a chance to sort of see how Q2 finished and see how Q3 started. And that's kind of built into our guidance. We anticipated there were going to be some levels of ups and downs. And so when we project the Q3 that we think is approximately flat to 2019, it takes that into account. Yes. Thanks, David. No, broadly, there's no change in the strategy. We continue to have a lot of confidence in this platform. We will continue to offer at a premium price. We're very pleased with the way it's been performing, and we were happy to see that 1,200 patient experience reported at the virtual EuroPCR. One of the reasons why there's no real changes, we really try and focus on great outcomes, and so we're very deliberate about training center by center across Europe as we implement. And so you can see more of a continuation of what you've seen in the past. Bob, you're breaking up a little bit. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, the newest technologies are not quite ready to have a broad impact. But one of the things we've seen is an incredible amount of agility and creativity on the part of the heart teams to make things happen. I mean, obviously, we tried to support them along the way. But they just pivoted. They find ways to get patients in. They found ways to bring patients to a safe place, to do a work up. They found ways to do some things virtually that they had always done in person. So it was remarkable to us to observe sort of a pivot on their part to make it happen. Yes. Thanks, Matt. So things have been very different by region of the world and certainly, region of the country. In terms of the new centers, they didn't have a tremendous impact on the second quarter. Most of it came from centers that were already in place. And again, we've had a chance to spend time with a number of hospital CEOs, and we've been impressed that they just set their mind to trying to make a pivot and be able to treat structural heart, in particular AS patients, during this time. So I think the last time that we addressed it, Matt, we said there were about 700 U.S. centers and that we were headed toward 850. I think COVID does slow that down some. So it will continue, but it wasn't a big part of the story in this quarter. Yes, we hear you fine, Bob. Yes. Bob, you know what we're dealing with right now. There's so much uncertainty associated with the progression of COVID. It's very difficult. We're being somewhat courageous here to offer guidance at this point, with the uncertainty in front of us. So we're not ready to dial-in to anything very specific. We do have the confidence to say \u2013 no, we really believe we're going to be in growth mode, but we're not prepared to get that precise. Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're really looking forward to launching in China. Our belief is that there were maybe, I don't know, 2,400, 2,500 cases performed in 2019. So a nice opportunity. And it's been served almost exclusive \u2013 or not almost, but exclusively by local companies. We're going to come in with a very different kind of approach, where we really focus on outstanding outcomes. We're going to try and really service those accounts. We're going to try and train them and make sure that they have great proctoring and support along the way. So we're not expecting this to be a fast start. Matter of fact, it will be slow and deliberate. We don't expect it to have an appreciable difference on our 2020 performance, but we really like what it could do on a long-term basis. Yes. I can't say, Robbie, that we've seen anything that's major during the quarter. So we feel like much of it has been somewhat consistent to what we've seen in the past. We continue to be very disciplined ourselves. I'm not positive exactly what other competitors are doing, but I haven't heard anything that's particularly noteworthy. Yes. Thanks. So I think sometimes there was a misconception. We were never contraindicated. There was just always this notion that we didn't have the data that demonstrated safety. So now with the data that's been submitted, we're in a position there's no longer that safety concern. I don't know if it makes a big difference. We have routinely treated these patients right along. And so it's a positive for patients. We're not expecting it to have a big difference on our future volumes. No. Thanks, Larry. Yes, no, we really don't see that. You probably imagine what would be going on in 2020, if it wasn't for COVID, we would be enjoying, we think, some pretty hefty double-digit growth rates. And so no, COVID's not \u2013 we don't see it as an accelerator, but we've been so impressed by the ability of the system to adapt and find ways of treating COVID patients and their AS patients. Yes. It's a good question, Larry. We're not prepared to update how big we think the TMTT market is in 2024. You can tell we continue to be really excited about it. We wouldn't be putting this kind of energy into it, if we didn't think it was a big opportunity by 2024. And that's just the beginning, it's going to get much bigger beyond that. But you'd have to say that given it's a developing market and it needs clinical trials for it to develop that COVID is somewhat of a setback. We'll see what it is. We're hoping that it's pretty contained but we're not prepared to update any thinking at this point. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I don't know the number, but my \u2013 I would say it's really low. I don't think that new centers were trying to do TAVR during the onset of a global pandemic. I mean it just wasn't there. So it wasn't really much of a factor. There may have been a few that I'm not aware of, but I think it was an obstacle for people to start to add bigger issues. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, there may have been some advantage that we're the incumbent. But maybe the bigger issue is that we've got some really trustworthy and proven results. We've got \u2013 people can count on the SAPIEN platform in terms of how it's going to perform. They don't have to worry so much about a pacemaker that's going to mean the patient has to stay in the hospital longer, very little chance of ICU. So they just have more confidence in the system. And frankly, there's just not many opportunities if you have something brand-new to be able to train centers. And so there is some advantage, but I almost think the bigger advantage is from having a reliable system. Yes. No, it's a good question. We've actually been wondering that. And we spend a lot of time with people across the health care system that worry about how do you get patients to reengage and come back to the hospitals. Hospitals have really worked on it, and they try and provide a safe place. They're encouraging direct contact with the physician. But the one thing that we know about AS, it is a deadly disease. It's just got a lousy future. And so those patients are highly incented to enter the system. And I guess we're kind of learning like everybody else. We saw a rebound much faster in May and June than we were expecting. Yes. Thanks. We're very excited about starting this EVOQUE trial in the tricuspid position. It really turns out to be a great platform. It is a platform that can be used in mitral. We have decided that we were going to advance M3 first, as the first platform for mitral regurgitation. We still like EVOQUE. And it may have a role, but we're going to have EVOQUE lead in the tricuspid position and M3 lead in the mitral position. We continue to do cases in Cardioband. Most of them get done in the tricuspid position, and we're very pleased with the positive clinical outcomes. It's not broadly adopted, but for those that are engaged in it, they're quite happy and the procedure times are coming down. We are really focused on updating that design. To be able to be one that is more easily used by many other clinicians and can lead to shorter times and more effective procedures. So that's also a key priority for the company. So the second part of the question, if you can just \u2013 can you just say it again, please, Vijay? Yes. Yes. So the M3 and EVOQUE systems are both transfemoral, right? So if that really gets at it, yes. So we think that they are \u2013 they have the opportunity here to be adopted, if we can demonstrate strong evidence. So on the mitral side, you were going to be coming up the venous side, right? So the transfemoral for MR is \u2013 and so also \u2013 so if you will, we come across the septum in the case of the mitral valve, whereas become transfemoral for the tricuspid valve. Thanks, Pito. It's hard for us to know. And let me tell you why, and we're not trying to be evasive here. We're going into a market where it's the individual pays, it's private pay. It comes out of their pocket. And so our experiences in other places of the world are just not as applicable. We also are going into a market where there's local competitors, and they were local first. So it's not clear to us how fast it's going to develop and how big it's going to be. We think there is a lot of disease, and we think there are a lot of people that will be interested in a first-class system to get their disease treated, but we're just not able to size it yet. Yes. Thanks, Pito. During this difficult time, it's really tough for us to know what market share is. So just know how fast the market grew is something we're just not comfortable to talk about. The data is lagging, it's incomplete, and we just don't have a clear picture. So say it again, Joanne, please? You mean what was \u2013 what did we exit as a growth rate? No, we're just saying, Joanne, we don't feel comfortable that the exit rate is a good proxy for the rest of the year. Remember, probably some of the cases that we were doing in June were probably catch-up from what was postponed in \u2013 earlier in the quarter. And so probably not an ideal way to be able to do modeling. We've tried to share with you our best estimate, and we've even included how we started the third quarter and say, based on that, this is how we think Q3 is going to go, and we think it's likely to be flat. But the exit rate, although interesting, is probably not the best measure. Yes. Thanks, Joanne. So what we were pleased with is we saw a willingness on the part of centers to get back involved. And I think we shared a 50% number. So about 50% of the people in the class trials that we said, hey, we're pausing, have already approached us and said, we're ready to go. Now from when they're ready to go to when they're actually treating patients, takes some time. There's actually a much smaller number of those centers that have actually treated patients. But they're coming back. So it's going to cost us time, Joanne, clearly, on these clinical trials. It will \u2013 yet to be seen, whether it's two quarters, more or less, I don't know. But there clearly is some kind of a pause and it will be somewhat dependent on the progression \u2013 precaution of COVID-19. Yes. Thanks, Rick. We're passionate about this whole area of being able to help these mitral and tricuspid patients. When you're involved in a lawsuit, it just consumes a lot of energy. And not only consumes the energy of the legal team, but it pulls much of the senior team into it, it pulls our field teams into it, it pulls our R&D teams into it. And it's just a distraction. Instead of having people focused on how can I do great things for patients? How do I advance this therapy? You're involved in some kind of a chess match. So it's a real joy for us to say that, that time-consuming distraction is gone and we can focus on the exciting innovations that help patients that are suffering from valve disease. Yes. Thanks, Rick. Yes, those are \u2013 those continue to be very important. You can imagine, things like early TAVR, where you kind of slow down a little bit when you go through something like COVID, but we are \u2013 continue to be passionate about being able to treat asymptomatic patients, and we're optimistic about that. And we also really want to get after these moderate patients. We continue to do a lot of thinking about that. We're not ready with a clinical trial design because that will be a very important one. But that's one that's clearly on our radar screen that we're going to continue to evaluate. Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone. And so I'll turn it back to you."

After the formal presentation, we will follow with a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].Without any further ado, I will now turn the call over to Mark Wilterding. Mr. Wilterding, you may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Victor. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released its first quarter 2020 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss the results included in the press release and accompanied financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations.These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those associated with COVID-19 pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product that safety information may be found in the press release, our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures, otherwise they\u2019re referring to GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are included in today's press release.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. Before we dive into our first quarter results and updated 2020 outlook, I'd like to give you a broader sense of what's happening at the company in light of COVID-19 and how Edwards has responded during these challenging times. As you'd expect, our priority has been to continue to serve patients counting on us, support our clinical partners and protect the wellbeing of our employees.We are striving to maintain continuous access of our lifesaving technologies, as well as offering frontline in-hospital support. Most importantly, on behalf of everyone at Edwards, I want to express our gratitude to our clinician partners and the global healthcare community for their tireless dedication to serving patients during this challenging time. We appreciate their strong leadership and brave commitment to patient care and we're dedicated to supporting them as they address this global health crisis.I'm encouraged by the recent indication of plateauing and even declining infection rates and deaths from COVID-19 in many areas around the world. But we know that healthcare workers on the frontline continue to face unprecedented challenges.In the words of Dr. Craig Smith from Columbia University, I am confident that we will sail through this together in due time. I also want to recognize the extraordinary actions of our 14,000 employees around the world that have taken to overcome the unique challenges associated with COVID-19.Edwards is proud to be a member of the critical healthcare infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness, and passion of our employees in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients and also volunteering their help in our communities during this difficult period of time. Thanks to our global supply chain team and our government and regulatory partnerships around the world.Despite significant challenges, our manufacturing operations have continued to deliver and we've been able to supply our technologies to more than 100 countries around the world. Our dedicated manufacturing employees have been able to consistently meet the global demand for our structural heart technologies.As noted at our December investor conference, we focused energy and resources to improve the capacity and agility of our global production facilities over the last few years and it's really become apparent at this time. In Europe, there's been an increased need for supply of our pressure monitoring products in critical care. We're grateful to our employees, who\u2019re making progress to more than double our production to keep up with this demand and serve critically ill patients in need.Our valued third-party suppliers are a critical piece of this infrastructure and we work closely with them in an effort to avoid disruption. We are proactively managing capacity, assessing alternative logistic options and closely managing the supply of components. Our team's commitment to delivering life saving technologies to patients is unwavering. I also want to commend our clinical field teams for their work providing real time support for patients and frontline clinicians at this time when it's needed most. Their courage and resiliency in assisting clinicians and patients has been truly impressive. In March alone, Edwards provided clinical support for TAVR procedures in all 50 states in the U.S., and in almost 60 countries around the world.At all times, we have adhered to important measures to protect the safety of our employees, while also continuing the critical work of providing life saving technologies for patients. We'll continue to rely on trusted global health sources, governments and local hospital policies to inform our decision making. Because of our strong team and patient focused culture, I have absolute confidence in our ability to successfully navigate this unprecedented global crisis.Finally, I want to recognize the important role and impact of our charitable partners in meeting both local and global community needs at this time. To respond to these needs driven by the pandemic, the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation issued emergency grants to more than 20 partner organizations and communities where our Edwards employees live and work around the world.Additionally, Edwards is providing donations of critical care technologies during this crisis to help physicians care for underserved patients. We will stay closely connected to our charitable partners to understand other ways that we can help in our communities. Also, in the first quarter our foundation achieved its longstanding goal of screening and treating more than 1.5 million underserved people in over 35 countries, through our Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. It\u2019s truly a remarkable effort by our charitable partners, and one that inspires me personally.We're using our knowledge gained from our first phase of Every Heartbeat Matters to set a new bold goal to improve the lives of 2.5 million more underserved structural heart and critical care patients by the end of 2025.Finally, before I get into our results, it was 20 years ago this month we rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, marking the spin off from Baxter and officially beginning our journey as Edwards Lifesciences. And it's been an incredible journey and we are not done yet. Not even close. While we continue to actively monitor COVID-19 and its potential business disruptions, we remain confident in our long-term patient focused strategy and innovation pipeline. There are still many patients in need. I remain very confident in our global team and culture that once this crisis passes, and it will pass, together, we will achieve many more successes.Now turning to first quarter results. Despite challenges associated with COVID-19, we reported $1.1 billion in sales this quarter, representing 14% sales growth. In Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement or TAVR, our first quarter global sales were $742 million, up 25% on an underlying basis. Our global TAVR sales growth through early March was consistent with our strong fourth quarter global growth rate. This was dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter as procedures fell as a result of the COVID-19 disruptions. As you might expect, procedure volumes in March varied greatly by geography, even by hospital as patients and providers turned their focus to the pandemic.Estimating TAVR procedure growth is more challenging than ever in the current environment. We anticipate being able to better position -- to be in a better position to estimate TAVR procedure growth and our competitive share once the global situation begins to normalize. Globally, average selling prices were stable.In U.S., our TAVR sales grew approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Our U.S. TAVR sales growth through early March was consistent with our strong fourth quarter growth rate driven by a step up in TAVR treatments as new patients entered the system independent of their surgical risk.During the last few weeks of the quarter, procedures dropped precipitously, and were highly variable across the country.The rollout of SAPIEN 3 Ultra continued to be very positive in the first quarter and clinician feedback on improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Ultra accounted for more than 30% of our U.S. and European TAVR volumes exiting the first quarter. To ensure the safety of our employees and clinician partners from the threat of COVID-19 however, we've decided to pause proctoring of centers that are not already trained on the device. We anticipate resuming the SAPIEN 3 Ultra rollout as soon as we go back to a more stable environment.As you may recall, we committed to following the PARTNER 3 patients for 10 years and in March, the two year follow up was presented at the virtual ACC Conference. Overall, we were extremely pleased that the clinical outcomes of SAPIEN 3 in low risk patients continues to be excellent at two years.Outside the U.S. in the first quarter TAVR sales grew in the mid-teens year-over-year on an underlying basis. In Europe, Edwards\u2019 growth was even stronger than our fourth quarter and better than expected through early March, before being impacted by dramatically slower procedure growth related to COVID-19. Despite this headwind, we were encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR across most countries.In Japan, we saw very good TAVR adoption. First quarter procedures in Japan were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19, although we expect it to negatively impact Q2 sales there.In summary, based on what we know today, we assume the impact of COVID-19 on our TAVR sales will be the most severe in the second quarter, followed by a gradual recovery in the third quarter and in fourth quarter that resembles our original expectations for sales. Although we're encouraged by recent news of improving infection rates from COVID-19, we also recognize the high degree of continued uncertainty in terms of hospital procedure volumes.We now estimate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 to be flat to 2019, with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%, versus our previous expectation of approximately 15% sales growth.However, what we know for certain is that severe aortic stenosis is relentless, and Edwards remains committed to delivering critical solutions to these patients even in the face of the extraordinary challenges caused by COVID-19. We remain confident that the opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024.In transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, first quarter global sales were approximately $10 million. From a commercial standpoint, we experienced strong momentum and accelerated adoption of PASCAL in Europe. We continue to be pleased with PASCAL's acute clinical outcomes and physician feedback remains positive. We were tracking to our expectations until the last few weeks of the quarter, when sales declined abruptly due to the impact of COVID-19.As previously announced, we've temporarily paused new enrollments in our mitral and tricuspid active pivotal clinical trials. We are coordinating closely with the trials\u2019 investigators and the decision to resume enrollment will be made in consultation with each investigator and hospital. We remain laser focused on our vision of transforming care for patients with mitral and tricuspid valvular disease by developing a portfolio of innovative therapies supported by a growing body of clinical evidence.We continue to gain experience and make meaningful progress across the portfolio and you can expect to hear informative updates regarding PASCAL, Cardioband and EVOQUE at the upcoming EuroPCR medical meeting. In Q2, we expect a significant negative impact on transcatheter mitral and tricuspid procedures as healthcare systems focus on fighting the pandemic since these procedures currently require general anesthesia and an ICU stay.We anticipate recovery beginning in Q3 and remain committed to our strategy of ensuring procedural success and differentiated patient outcomes through our high-touch support model. We are revising our revenue range to $30 million to $45 million for the full year from our previous expectation of $50 million to $70 million. We feel confident that we're well positioned to navigate and manage through these unprecedented challenges with our long-term strategy and dedicated focused team.We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity will reach approximately $3 billion by 2024 and are passionate about bringing solutions for these deadly diseases and improving patients\u2019 lives around the world. In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter sales of $193 million declined 9% on an underlying basis. As expected, driven by the rapid adoption of TAVR, the U.S. surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds experienced in the fourth quarter persisted into the first quarter.During the last few weeks of March, we experienced a sharp deceleration in procedures related to COVID-19. We remain very encouraged by the continued adoption of our premium INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, which is driving an increasing share of surgical aortic valve procedures. Based on favorable patient outcomes and positive physicians\u2019 feedback, it's not surprising that in INSPIRIS valve has become the number one implanted surgical aortic valve in the U.S. and Japan.In Europe, HARPOON, our beating heart mitral valve repair system is now available commercially and we plan to launch it as the environment stabilizes. In addition, we're also pleased to report that we recently received FDA approval to begin our U.S. pivotal IDE study and begin enrollment to begin -- and expect enrollment to begin in the second half of 2020. Recall that HARPOON offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients.In summary, because of the impact associated with COVID-19, we now expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 to decline 5% to 15% from 2019 versus our previous expectation of zero to 3% growth. Our expectation is that lower case rate at the end of Q1 in the U.S. and Europe will continue in Q2.We anticipate that our Q4 sales will return to positive growth, driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. As we move beyond COVID-19 and even as transcatheter technology expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies.To summarize, TAVR, TMTT and Surgical, as the COVID disruption subsides there ultimately are structural heart patients who delayed their treatment and will get treated. However, sadly, we expect that because of these delays, some patients will worsen and not survive the delay given the deadly nature of these chronic conditions. It's difficult to quantify the impact on patients at this time but recall data published in the Journal of Thoracic Surgery suggests that patients waiting for aortic valve replacement have a 4% mortality risk at one month, 8% at three months, and 12% after waiting six months. This is a very difficult time for structural heart patients as they weigh the risk of COVID-19 versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease.In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $183 million increased 1% on an underlying basis. Growth in the first quarter was driven by greater demand in Europe, primarily for our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices, partially offset by lower demand for our enhanced surgical recovery products. Recall that our Critical Care product line is focused on helping two distinct groups of patients. The larger of which require hemodynamic monitor -- monitoring in the surgical setting, and the smaller group who require support in the ICU.While the pandemic remains active, revenues from our enhanced surgical recovery products will be significantly lower, partially offset by increased demand for ICU products. We have also seen some delay in HemoSphere orders in the U.S., as hospitals limit their capital spending as they focus on COVID-19.In summary, because of the uncertainty related to COVID-19, we now estimate Critical Care sales growth for 2020 to be flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%, versus our previous expectation of 6% to 9% growth.And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Hey thanks a lot, Mike. Today I'll provide a perspective on the first quarter along with some additional directions on how the rest of the year may unfold based upon what we know today. I'm very pleased with the overall financial results in Q1, including our sales of $1.1 billion. Appreciate that our results reflected two very different periods during the quarter. Through early March, our total sales were running a little ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in TAVR in Europe. Pre-COVID we were running at underlying growth rates closer to the fourth quarter of 2019 than to our Q1 guidance expectations.The second phase of the quarter was when we felt the impact of COVID in Europe and the U.S. and sales in the last few weeks of March were substantially lower than we originally expected. Our sales in April remain depressed, even though COVID admissions appear to be plateauing.While our sales in Q1 were lower than expected, so was our spending, so that adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was $1.51, which was within our guidance range. GAAP earnings per share was $1.47. a full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.Now, I'll cover the details of our first quarter results as well as discuss guidance for the balance of the year. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 76.7% consistent with the prior year quarter. This year's rate benefited from a favorable product mix offset by lower foreign exchange hedge gains and spending in support of the new European Medical Device regulations. COVID didn't have much of an impact our GP rate in the first quarter. Although we'll see the negative impact from COVID later this year as the higher cost inventory is sold.Regarding operating expenses, first quarter expenses were lower than expected primarily as a result of the COVID impact. Some expenses declined naturally due to less travel and meeting expenses, as well as delayed clinical trial activity. We are implementing cost control measures. And at the same time, we have intentionally not implemented actions to significantly reduce our investment plans supporting our long-term growth strategy. Our priority has been to keep our people safe, secure and focused on helping patients.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $308 million or 27.3% of sales compared to $280 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by additions we have made in field clinical personnel to support TAVR cases in the U.S. and TMTT in Europe.Research and development expenses grew 9% to $187 million, or 16.6% of sales, compared to $171 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. As we announced previously, we made a strategic decision to pause TMTT clinical trials in response to the urgent COVID-19 response around the globe. This will have a moderate negative impact to sales and results in a corresponding reduction in planned research and development spending for the remainder of the year.Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.8%. This rate included a 270 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock based compensation, which was 230 basis points, or $0.04 unfavorable to our guidance expectation. Our rate this quarter also benefited from a favorable tax audit settlement. As a result of increased uncertainty, we now expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%.Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales growth by approximately 0.9% or $8 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $50 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full year 2020 sales versus 2019.Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by about a penny reflecting our effective currency hedging program.Turning to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet with approximately $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit up to $1 billion and our public bonds don't mature until 2028. Additionally, we continue to generate healthy cash flows. Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased 3 million shares for $615 million during the first quarter.We started buying back stock in the open market in February. In March, shares were purchased by a bank on behalf of Edwards through a preestablished 10b5 program. This program automatically went into effect when Edwards\u2019 stock price declined with the market selloff. We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $625 million. Average shares outstanding in Q1 was 211.7 million and we are updating our guidance for average shares outstanding for the full year to 210 million to 212 million, down from 212 million to 214 million.Please note that we will host our Annual Shareholder Meeting virtually this year on Thursday, May 7th. As outlined in our proxy statement filed last month, one of the proposals to be voted on by our shareholders will be to increase the number of shares outstanding for the purpose of effecting a 3 for 1 stock split. We expect to make split adjusted financial information available under our Investor Relations website following the execution of the split.Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $125 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $207 million less capital spending of $82 million. Our first quarter free cash flow is traditionally our lowest quarter during the year. We are not updating our free cash flow guidance for the year. Although, we expect it will fall short of our original expectation of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion.Now I'll turn to the guidance for full year 2020. As you know, we cannot accurately predict the progression of COVID nor the timeline or extent of the disruption to hospital procedures utilizing the therapies Edwards provides. As a result, there is a wide range of potential outcomes for sales and earnings and we will provide a wider-than-usual range of 2020 guidance based upon what we know today.We have modeled multiple scenarios based on the pace at which hospitals return to more normal treatment rates. Our guidance assumes the impact of COVID to be most severe in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery during the course of the third quarter and a fourth quarter that comes close to our original expectations. Based upon our recovery assumptions, Edwards\u2019 sales growth for the full year is estimated to be flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%. That reflects TAVR and Critical Care growth of flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%; Surgical, minus 15% to minus 5% versus 2019; and TMTT revenues of $30 million to $45 million.The recovery of our structural heart businesses will be influenced by many factors and tempered by the time it takes for patients to seek and receive treatment. It's common for the screening process alone to take two to three months. 2020 sales guidance for the total company is now expected to be $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion versus our previous range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion. For the second quarter, we estimate sales of $700 million to $900 million.We've also modeled more conservative recovery scenarios versus our base case, such as a recovery beginning later in the year, or a recovery followed by a resurgence in COVID that extend these conditions into 2021. We are not providing financial guidance related to those scenarios. But we are prepared to operate under those conditions if necessary. Our guidance does not anticipate a second wave of COVID-19.So overall, while providing guidance that\u2019s subject to an abnormally high level of risk, we're providing you a transparent view of our forecast. We'll obviously continue to provide visibility into how our thinking evolves in the quarters ahead.Before I turn it back to Mike, I'll make one additional comment about our team at Edwards. In the last couple of months we've learned how to communicate in new ways internally and with all of our external partners, keep the global infrastructure and systems of Edwards running smoothly, and even close our books remotely. It has made us a stronger team and I'm confident we will continue to succeed with our patient-centered strategy and sustainable growth goals.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. So whether you're new to our story, or you follow the company since we went public 20 years ago, you know that our talented and dedicated team at Edwards has always put patients first. Never has this been more important than today. As we stand together with the global community, I'm grateful for our extraordinary team and our partners, and I'm optimistic about the future of continuing to deliver innovations to patients around the world.And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Mike. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Victor?\nOperator: Thank you. You have now reached our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nBob Hopkins: Thanks, Mike. So glad to hear everybody is well and congratulations on the strong results. I guess my first question is just on the guidance that you're providing. It seems like the Q2 guide at the midpoint is down about 25% year-over-year. Just curious, is that the run rate that you're on currently or is your current run rate a little worse than that?\nMike Mussallem: So the -- it varies different as you can imagine by geography. It also varies very different by business. I can summarize it this way Bob. Q2 is going to be a really tough quarter. It's come down hard, and we're living that right now. Even the numbers that we're providing for Q2 is probably moderately better than it is right now. I might add that our structural heart businesses feel it even more acutely than our critical care business.\nBob Hopkins: And then the follow-up -- and thanks for that, is just on the Q4 guidance, you just -- Mike or Scott, what are the things you guys considered, what are the things that sort of informed your view that we'll be all the way back to a normal quarter in Q4, despite this kind of, once in a lifetime, once in a generation type event we're going through right now? I am just curious, what are the data points that gave you that confidence that by Q4 you'll be all the way back to normal?\nMike Mussallem: So it's a good question, Bob. And this is very tough to do. So we know that it's challenging time to estimate revenues. We're starting to see positive signs already. And so in the tone of the tenor we really -- we hear people preparing themselves to start recovery. And we know that that's going to take some time. We also know that the diseases we treat are very serious and that we expect those diseases are not easy to postpone. And we know that many of the patients that might have been treated in Q1, Q2 and so forth, might indeed be treated in Q4. And so the combination of those factors that encourage us to say that we\u2019re likely -- and again, there's a broad range of possibilities but we\u2019re likely to be in a more typical volume situation in Q4.\nMark Wilterding: Victor, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nDavid Lewis: So one kind of just follow-up question and I\u2019ve a quick second one. Mike, just thinking of the fourth quarter recovery and not really talking about 2021 yet, but a lot of investors are fixated on if fourth quarter is going to be normal, it probably implies some sense of procedure recapture. But given the age of these patients and as you think about the low risk referral channel, to what extent do you think about or to what extent should investors be concerned about disruption to that referral channel, just considering the age of that patient and their willingness to sort of re-access the system in a post-COVID world? And then a quick follow-up for you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, no, it's very real. One thing for sure David is our patients were scared. They're afraid of COVID and it's meant that they have in many cases decided to stay home. So, there's many factors that influence the recovery. But if you do think of it as a bowl, as a funnel, there's been a bunch of patients that are waiting. So beginning the screening process again, that really needs to begin months in advance of the fourth quarter, is going to be key. It's going to be a big effort by the whole community. But I think the community is going to come to grips with the fact that this these heart valve patients, and AS patients in particular, really need to be treated and that they're in a dangerous situation, and we think that they are going to respond to that.So right now, the screening rates have not returned to prior levels, not even close. But we're anticipating that that's going to happen. And that's what will cause Q4 to be what it is.\nDavid Lewis: And I know it's challenging to think about share right now just given the moving dynamics. But if we assume the first 2.5 months of the quarter, we're running kind of close to 30% consistent with fourth quarter, it's pretty clear that you were taking share in the market certainly in certain regions. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing out there in the channel in the early part of the quarter as it relates to whether you think share was tied to capitalizing better than peers on new center expansion? Or you think this is now sort of definitive evidence that the unique attributes of S3 and low risk patients are sort of shining through with the clinicians?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks, David. Well, you know how we feel about SAPIEN 3 platform. We think it's outstanding and we think the PARTNER 3 study reinforced that and it's even nice to see this data that was generated at two years. But as we said, trying to estimate overall procedure growth is just really challenging right now in the current environment. We're going to be in a much better position to do that sometime in the future, but right now trying to speak to competitive share just seems inappropriate to us and will be -- make a lot more sense to do that once things normalize.\nMark Wilterding: Victor, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: A couple of questions here. I wanted to spend a moment on the ACC data. What did you think about the two year data? We did get some pushback comments from investors that at the two year mark the TAVR versus SAVR results close the gap a little bit. I would like to see your thought or hear your thoughts on that? And then I just want to go back to your comments on procedures. I'm trying to get my head around this concept of a catch up in terms of the patients that are being delayed. Did you dial that in, in your thought process for sort of a normal fourth quarter and/or are these patients ultimately just left out of the system? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So I'm going to have a little bit of a follow-up on your second question, Joanne. Let me try and get at your first one. Overall we were just -- we were extremely pleased with the outcomes of SAPIEN 3 in low risk patients at two years. Now remember what this was. This was a one -- it was a one year trial, right, with a one year endpoint. But we agreed to follow these patients for 10 years. And so you're going to get a snapshot each year into the future.Yes, the numbers did come closer together. But one of the things that's positive is numerically TAVR stays superior to surgery at two years. Then it gets -- and it's still numerically better. So the numbers are quite small at this point, Joanne. So just a couple of deaths or a couple of strokes can change that - can be the difference between statistical superiority and just being called equivalent. And so if it's very small differences, but no we weren\u2019t discouraged by that at all. We continue to be very encouraged.And your second question is about catch up and resuming normal of expected treatments. So I want to make sure that I'm answering what you're asking, Joanne. Are you asking what about the patient? Even if we catch up, there's a lot of patients that won't have been treated during 2020. Are you asking me to comment on those?\nJoanne Wuensch: Yes. Because we have been trying to think about, okay, patients who are deferred now, at what stage should they come back into the system and the answer may be at the end of the year, 2021 or sadly never?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So if this is a really tough time for patients. And ultimately, there may be some structural heart patients who\u2019ve delayed the treatment, who never get treated. And just because of deadly nature, some are not likely to survive. If you just run the numbers here, it gets to be an extraordinary large group of patients and that distresses us greatly. It's just the difficult times, the disease is clearly progressive. And so we know about some patients already anecdotally who have passed away on the waiting list, which is very sad. But no, this is a tough time as the world has turned their attention to COVID. It's not a great set of conditions for structural heart patients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Taylor: I guess from that line of thinking, I was just hoping you might give us some color that you're getting from your customers, or that you're thinking about in terms of supporting them through kind of the different phases of recovery? Have you talked to your possible customers about how they're going to manage in triage, some of the structural heart cases in the early phases of recovery and how they'll move to more normal operations to kind of inform some of your assumptions here?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. Yes, we certainly have had a lot of conversations about that. And so what I'll share here will be somewhat anecdotal. It varies a great deal by region. You can imagine the situation in New York City is very different than what you might see in other parts of the U.S. and in other parts of the world, frankly.In the U.S. there are many people that are turning their attention to trying to get back to doing procedures again. You know hospitals are very dependent on doing procedures to be able to maintain their income and they also know that there are patients out there with real needs, and so they want to get back to it. There are various state regulations that they need to work through and then there's just a lot of machinery to start again.And in our case, we have to influence patients to come in and get screened again and begin that whole process. And so when procedures stop, screening also stops. And so that's the restarting of the system that's going on right now. And it's going to take some time, but I think people are clearly motivated to get it going and it is going to be highly variable, depending on where you are.\nMatt Taylor: Just one follow-up. I know you've paused the TMTT trial, which makes sense. Do you have any sense for in your framework that you laid out here when you might be able to get those restarted?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, that's a challenging one for us. The way it was paused, we're going to be able to open up individual centers when they're ready. If you're going to ask us broadly, what does that mean? Probably around two quarters. It's going to -- you're going to have a site-by-site restart. But I think a fair estimate is something like that we'd be disappointed if it went much longer. And we know that we have a lot of really motivated clinical investigators who encourage us to stop, but I think they are going to be the same people that encourage us to get started again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. You may now proceed with your question.\nRick Wise: Hi, Mike. A couple of questions. One bigger picture to start with. And you've touched on this a little bit but as you reflect on -- as I start to reflect on a post-COVID environment, and again, you've highlighted that patients are going to be anxious coming back to hospitals, et cetera. It seems to me there's an argument that the post-COVID recovery environment actually accelerate TAVR adoption, given the desire to get patients better, faster, get them out of the hospital quicker. The opposite side of that coin obviously is that could accelerate pressures on surgical valve growth outlook. Is there any merit in that accelerate TAVR and pressure on surgical valve thought?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Rick. And as you might imagine, there is indeed a wide range of outcomes. And so although it's very hard to say, but I think there are a number of people that are going to be motivated to go. The resources and equipment to restart TAVR given the short length of stay and the fact that it doesn't need an ICU could encourage people to try and get that procedure going, particularly considering how serious AS is. And so yes, there is a scenario where it could come up faster. But the other thing that we have to be clear on is, we've watched the system really screech to a halt. And so this -- it's a restart process. And indeed, I'm sure you know from your own research that patients are scared. And so getting them to re-enter whether it's hospitals or whether hospitals create places that patients can go and feel more comfortable, this is going to be the test of getting the system restarted. It's just a -- it's a wide range of possibilities.\nRick Wise: And just as a second question. You emphasized a couple of times that there will be informative updates, which sounds like, I don't know, strong language to me at EuroPCR on PASCAL, Cardioband and EVOQUE. Can you just share with us what you're thinking, what it could -- not what the data will be, but what the updates are likely to consist of and what we should expect? Thank you so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks very much, Rick. Yes, there are going to be a number of things accompanying probably a late-breaker and some oral abstracts and some posters, but probably two of that we call your attention to, on EVOQUE in the tricuspid position. I believe the early experience is going to be shared, which I believe is going to be 19 patients at 30 days. And so that will be the first time that the community has had a chance to see how that valve performs. And then in PASCAL, the CLASS study, actually the CE Mark study that evaluated both DMR and FMR patients, we will have 62 patients at one year and 109 patients at 30 days and six months. So it will be a nice informative update on those product lines for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: So Mike, how are you thinking about the pace of recovery for TAVR and may be SAVR compared to other types of procedures? Do you think valve procedures will come back faster because they're more medically necessary or do you think the advanced age of the patients make them reluctant to go to hospital? How do you think about that dynamic? And I had one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Larry. I don't have a strong view on other procedures. You know us, we're so focused on structural heart diseases, that's where we really put our energy. What we do know is that AS is particularly deadly and there is some data there that reinforces that. And so that makes us think that there is going to be a strong motivation for people to do this. And at a time when hospitals really want to get back to providing the care, and also I think they're frankly concerned about their economics, here is something that they can do that I think is really good for patients and it also helps them get back on their feet again.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then, Scott, just on the guidance, just to put a finer point on it. Q3, should we be thinking about that as basically kind of flattish year-over-year or actually maybe down a little bit? Thanks for taking the questions.\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks for the question, Larry. It's tough to say, and we've intentionally not tried to breakout Q2 versus Q3 versus Q4. What we know is that our assumption is based upon second quarter being the most severe followed by a gradual recovery in the third quarter and a fourth quarter that ultimately better resembles our original expectation for sales. But where that crosses from being below our original expectations to meeting our expectations, there is something that we just can't put a fine point on it at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on Bob's question about second quarter. So we pretty much have one-third of the quarter in the bag here and $700 million to $900 million. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of what has to happen from this point to get to $700 million, what has to happen to get to $900 million? I know there is a wide range of outcomes. But just help us understand what hits the bottom end from here, what hits the top end? Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. We're not accustomed to sort of slice it by month, Robbie, but I'll try and give you a little bit of color here. So the -- a lot of it is going to depend what COVID does itself and whether COVID keeps receding or not. Based on what we've seen so far, there needs to be improvement from where we are today to get to the middle of the range or certainly the top of the range. If we continue where we are today, we're going to be much closer to the bottom of the range. And it's just a wide range of possibilities in terms of how this quarter will play out. We probably never had a quarter that has a greater level of uncertainty as the second.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. And Scott, I love hearing when companies do right by their employees during tough times. I was wondering if you help us think about some of the moving pieces down the P&L here for gross margin, SG&A and R&D, it sounds like you're investing in R&D. But maybe just help us put it all together down the P&L and how you reach the EPS? Thanks.\nScott Ullem: Yes, sure. So on gross margin, there are number of things that are really unusual that are happening right now, and it includes, obviously starting with reduced manufacturing volumes. We're proactively managing our capacity and our supply chain. We are looking for alternatives in terms of logistics and trying to offset expedited freight that will show up in our gross margin in a negative degree. And we just got other extra costs that are involved in supporting our manufacturing operations in our seven facilities around the world. So there will be pressure on gross profit.In terms of SG&A, we've had some natural declines just in travel and conferences and the timing on headcount growth because we're still a growth company. But there are just some natural headwinds to being able to complete those investments on the time schedule that we had originally envisioned.In R&D, most of it is just delays in clinical trial enrollment that we've talked about, and that's what's going to a certain extent gate our ability to invest in that R&D growth. And then you get into tax and shares outstanding, which we've talked about a little bit. I'm not sure those are really as dependent upon the recovery or specific to Q2 being so soft. Does that get to your question?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. And I just might add that we have tried to really focus on prioritizing and protecting our employees and their jobs and we're not planning layoffs associated with this pandemic. And as I said earlier, we continue to support cases in every state and the countries around the world and we're going to do everything we can to continue to be a great partner through this entire process.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, thanks for fitting us in. So a couple of follow-ups. One on new centers. Mike, if you could talk a little bit about -- that's been an important trend for developing the market and rolling out across the U.S., what were you seeing and what do you expect over the next couple of quarters as the system kind of restarts? And then I had one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. I don't have hard data on that one. We currently estimate that there is more than 700 centers and we said that -- and this was following the NCD that was approved last year that we're probably headed toward 850 in total. So I don't know the exact number to where we are right now. I can tell you that since COVID hit, we've stopped doing the training and are really focused on the existing sites. And so that\u2019s probably going to change that adoption rate to some extent. But the bigger driver in terms of the way the Q1 was going before COVID hit was new patients coming off the sidelines. And that wasn't all concentrated in new sites, that was across the board.\nMatt Miksic: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just the other on sort of some of the other geographies, and we're all quite focused obviously on what's happening in the U.S. and the hopeful signs that some hospitals that you mentioned are starting to open back up or thinking about opening back up to more like the surgeries. But in other geographies, can you give us some sense of either re-improving, reemerging elective procedures or the ability anywhere else in the world or how would you compare the rest, let's say, Europe and Asia to what you're seeing here?\nMike Mussallem: Sure. So we would say in Europe, we saw a phenomena that was very similar to the U.S., which is a strict drop-off in March. Within Europe, some countries got hit much harder than others. But the net-net effect was Europe wasn't so different than the U.S. and we actually think that the recovery in Europe and the U.S. may not be so different. Interestingly enough, procedures in Japan in Q1 were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. We think that there is going to be a more pronounced effect in Q2. And it just seems from our perspective that the kind of the wave of COVID-19 patients in Japan is trailing what's happening in the U.S. and Europe by a matter of maybe weeks of some sort tough to know for sure. Those are the biggest markets. I mean there are other places around the world where TAVR is still young, like Australia and Latin America where there is still growth and not much impact from COVID. But those are kind of small numbers by comparison.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRaj Denhoy: I just wanted to build on these comments you made about the fourth quarter and getting back to where you thought you would have been kind of prior to this. And so when one thinks about kind of 2021, right, do you think about a growth rate in 2021 that is kind of normalized or do you think we actually will be at kind of a heightened growth rate in that year as we maybe make up some of these loss procedures in 2021? When do you expect the fall off to be as significant on a dollar basis as we're going to see here in 2020?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Sorry Raj, I mean, we're -- obviously it's premature for us to get into 2021 in a big way, but you can tell. When we say that we're going to start approaching recovery in Q4, you'd like to think that in 2021 we've got some pretty favorable comparisons. And so I would anticipate that.\nRaj Denhoy: Understood. And maybe just as a follow-up, a little bit of a follow-up to the last question. Germany is getting set to open up in a broad way, I guess the entire country in just next week. Have you picked up anything in terms of in anticipation for procedures to start to ramp in Germany or any early feedback as that country gets ready to open up again?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. We don't have anything broad at this point, Raj, but we do hear anecdotal comments. I mean the physicians there are very active researchers and many of them want to start conversations about getting going again. So there's a few anecdotal conversations about that, but really no hard data about how Germany will start up.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll try to ask both of them at the same go. One, Mike, back to ACC, your competition was making some noise on bicuspid data in low risk. Just curious to get your views on have you seen any impact in the market? And related, on the competitive front, any update on the mitral litigation side? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Sure. Yes, thanks, Vijay. So there's a lot of data on bicuspid and there has been some extensive published real world experiences. At Edwards, you know we're not contraindicated for these patients that we treat bicuspid patients with SAPIEN valves all the time. And our real world outcomes and these patients have been outstanding with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3. So we think that body of evidence is just going to grow and we expect there will be more data at cardiology conferences in the future. Your other question was about the IP. Yes, so big picture, I think we believe that our IP positions and we're prepared to defend them. We don't believe litigations necessarily in the best interest of patients, and we're going to hope that we can move through this. But there is a lot of litigation going on in a lot of countries with a lot of dates. And so it will be a continued source of noise at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. You may now ask your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Just if I could -- I just have one question. Just if I could on the recovery and the commentary, Mike, around losing some of these patients. I appreciate that these patients are very sick. However, in my checks, I'm hearing that the most urgent patients, i.e. designated their disease will progress too much that there they'll be re-hospitalized or won't survive over the next few months are being done today. Therefore, will these patients necessarily be lost? I guess I'm a little more bullish on the recovery curve as you probably saw with my upgrade. So just trying to get a sense of how confident you are that, that is going to be the case, because it sounds to me like a lot of those very sick patients are actually getting done? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: So you're right. Danielle. Certainly, there are very sick patients that aren't being done, right, we're not doing zero. But it's much lower than we expected to be doing at this time. And what I was trying to express, if you just think about it in a growth sense and it's a little bit dehumanizing. But if you think about what we were going to do and how many patients we're going to be treated during 2020 compared to the number of patients that we believe we're going to treat now, it's a much smaller number and that's a deep concern. We know that many AS patients do not get treated. And that's why that's actually one of the reasons why we are so enthusiastic about our work because we can get after this population that's not treated. So that pool of untreated patients just gets bigger, and we know that there is mortality associated with that.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.\nOperator: We have one final question with Josh Jennings here. Mr. Jennings, your line is now open.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks for fitting me in here. I guess, I'll just keep it to one. Just in terms of your outlook for the competitive landscape, when a competitor is in the market, potentially a new competitor with an approval later this year, any change in terms of all in terms of the competitive headwinds, because we just imagine that getting cases proctored and moving forward with the launch could be a little bit challenging for the competitors. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that? Thanks again.\nOperator: This is the conference operator. My apologies. I believe we may have just lost our speaker. Mr. Wilterding, can you hear me? Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. I believe our speaker has concluded the presentation here. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Hey thanks a lot, Mike. Today I'll provide a perspective on the first quarter along with some additional directions on how the rest of the year may unfold based upon what we know today. I'm very pleased with the overall financial results in Q1, including our sales of $1.1 billion. Appreciate that our results reflected two very different periods during the quarter. Through early March, our total sales were running a little ahead of our expectations, with notable strength in TAVR in Europe. Pre-COVID we were running at underlying growth rates closer to the fourth quarter of 2019 than to our Q1 guidance expectations.The second phase of the quarter was when we felt the impact of COVID in Europe and the U.S. and sales in the last few weeks of March were substantially lower than we originally expected. Our sales in April remain depressed, even though COVID admissions appear to be plateauing.While our sales in Q1 were lower than expected, so was our spending, so that adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was $1.51, which was within our guidance range. GAAP earnings per share was $1.47. a full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.Now, I'll cover the details of our first quarter results as well as discuss guidance for the balance of the year. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 76.7% consistent with the prior year quarter. This year's rate benefited from a favorable product mix offset by lower foreign exchange hedge gains and spending in support of the new European Medical Device regulations. COVID didn't have much of an impact our GP rate in the first quarter. Although we'll see the negative impact from COVID later this year as the higher cost inventory is sold.Regarding operating expenses, first quarter expenses were lower than expected primarily as a result of the COVID impact. Some expenses declined naturally due to less travel and meeting expenses, as well as delayed clinical trial activity. We are implementing cost control measures. And at the same time, we have intentionally not implemented actions to significantly reduce our investment plans supporting our long-term growth strategy. Our priority has been to keep our people safe, secure and focused on helping patients.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $308 million or 27.3% of sales compared to $280 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by additions we have made in field clinical personnel to support TAVR cases in the U.S. and TMTT in Europe.Research and development expenses grew 9% to $187 million, or 16.6% of sales, compared to $171 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. As we announced previously, we made a strategic decision to pause TMTT clinical trials in response to the urgent COVID-19 response around the globe. This will have a moderate negative impact to sales and results in a corresponding reduction in planned research and development spending for the remainder of the year.Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.8%. This rate included a 270 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock based compensation, which was 230 basis points, or $0.04 unfavorable to our guidance expectation. Our rate this quarter also benefited from a favorable tax audit settlement. As a result of increased uncertainty, we now expect our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%.Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter sales growth by approximately 0.9% or $8 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $50 million negative impact or about 1.5% to full year 2020 sales versus 2019.Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted earnings per share by about a penny reflecting our effective currency hedging program.Turning to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet with approximately $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit up to $1 billion and our public bonds don't mature until 2028. Additionally, we continue to generate healthy cash flows. Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased 3 million shares for $615 million during the first quarter.We started buying back stock in the open market in February. In March, shares were purchased by a bank on behalf of Edwards through a preestablished 10b5 program. This program automatically went into effect when Edwards' stock price declined with the market selloff. We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $625 million. Average shares outstanding in Q1 was 211.7 million and we are updating our guidance for average shares outstanding for the full year to 210 million to 212 million, down from 212 million to 214 million.Please note that we will host our Annual Shareholder Meeting virtually this year on Thursday, May 7th. As outlined in our proxy statement filed last month, one of the proposals to be voted on by our shareholders will be to increase the number of shares outstanding for the purpose of effecting a 3 for 1 stock split. We expect to make split adjusted financial information available under our Investor Relations website following the execution of the split.Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $125 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $207 million less capital spending of $82 million. Our first quarter free cash flow is traditionally our lowest quarter during the year. We are not updating our free cash flow guidance for the year. Although, we expect it will fall short of our original expectation of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion.Now I'll turn to the guidance for full year 2020. As you know, we cannot accurately predict the progression of COVID nor the timeline or extent of the disruption to hospital procedures utilizing the therapies Edwards provides. As a result, there is a wide range of potential outcomes for sales and earnings and we will provide a wider-than-usual range of 2020 guidance based upon what we know today.We have modeled multiple scenarios based on the pace at which hospitals return to more normal treatment rates. Our guidance assumes the impact of COVID to be most severe in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery during the course of the third quarter and a fourth quarter that comes close to our original expectations. Based upon our recovery assumptions, Edwards' sales growth for the full year is estimated to be flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%. That reflects TAVR and Critical Care growth of flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%; Surgical, minus 15% to minus 5% versus 2019; and TMTT revenues of $30 million to $45 million.The recovery of our structural heart businesses will be influenced by many factors and tempered by the time it takes for patients to seek and receive treatment. It's common for the screening process alone to take two to three months. 2020 sales guidance for the total company is now expected to be $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion versus our previous range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion. For the second quarter, we estimate sales of $700 million to $900 million.We've also modeled more conservative recovery scenarios versus our base case, such as a recovery beginning later in the year, or a recovery followed by a resurgence in COVID that extend these conditions into 2021. We are not providing financial guidance related to those scenarios. But we are prepared to operate under those conditions if necessary. Our guidance does not anticipate a second wave of COVID-19.So overall, while providing guidance that's subject to an abnormally high level of risk, we're providing you a transparent view of our forecast. We'll obviously continue to provide visibility into how our thinking evolves in the quarters ahead.Before I turn it back to Mike, I'll make one additional comment about our team at Edwards. In the last couple of months we've learned how to communicate in new ways internally and with all of our external partners, keep the global infrastructure and systems of Edwards running smoothly, and even close our books remotely. It has made us a stronger team and I'm confident we will continue to succeed with our patient-centered strategy and sustainable growth goals. Yes. Thanks for the question, Larry. It's tough to say, and we've intentionally not tried to breakout Q2 versus Q3 versus Q4. What we know is that our assumption is based upon second quarter being the most severe followed by a gradual recovery in the third quarter and a fourth quarter that ultimately better resembles our original expectation for sales. But where that crosses from being below our original expectations to meeting our expectations, there is something that we just can't put a fine point on it at this point. Yes, sure. So on gross margin, there are number of things that are really unusual that are happening right now, and it includes, obviously starting with reduced manufacturing volumes. We're proactively managing our capacity and our supply chain. We are looking for alternatives in terms of logistics and trying to offset expedited freight that will show up in our gross margin in a negative degree. And we just got other extra costs that are involved in supporting our manufacturing operations in our seven facilities around the world. So there will be pressure on gross profit.In terms of SG&A, we've had some natural declines just in travel and conferences and the timing on headcount growth because we're still a growth company. But there are just some natural headwinds to being able to complete those investments on the time schedule that we had originally envisioned.In R&D, most of it is just delays in clinical trial enrollment that we've talked about, and that's what's going to a certain extent gate our ability to invest in that R&D growth. And then you get into tax and shares outstanding, which we've talked about a little bit. I'm not sure those are really as dependent upon the recovery or specific to Q2 being so soft. Does that get to your question?"

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Before we dive into our first quarter results and updated 2020 outlook, I'd like to give you a broader sense of what's happening at the company in light of COVID-19 and how Edwards has responded during these challenging times. As you'd expect, our priority has been to continue to serve patients counting on us, support our clinical partners and protect the wellbeing of our employees.We are striving to maintain continuous access of our lifesaving technologies, as well as offering frontline in-hospital support. Most importantly, on behalf of everyone at Edwards, I want to express our gratitude to our clinician partners and the global healthcare community for their tireless dedication to serving patients during this challenging time. We appreciate their strong leadership and brave commitment to patient care and we're dedicated to supporting them as they address this global health crisis.I'm encouraged by the recent indication of plateauing and even declining infection rates and deaths from COVID-19 in many areas around the world. But we know that healthcare workers on the frontline continue to face unprecedented challenges.In the words of Dr. Craig Smith from Columbia University, I am confident that we will sail through this together in due time. I also want to recognize the extraordinary actions of our 14,000 employees around the world that have taken to overcome the unique challenges associated with COVID-19.Edwards is proud to be a member of the critical healthcare infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness, and passion of our employees in maintaining their important work on behalf of patients and also volunteering their help in our communities during this difficult period of time. Thanks to our global supply chain team and our government and regulatory partnerships around the world.Despite significant challenges, our manufacturing operations have continued to deliver and we've been able to supply our technologies to more than 100 countries around the world. Our dedicated manufacturing employees have been able to consistently meet the global demand for our structural heart technologies.As noted at our December investor conference, we focused energy and resources to improve the capacity and agility of our global production facilities over the last few years and it's really become apparent at this time. In Europe, there's been an increased need for supply of our pressure monitoring products in critical care. We're grateful to our employees, who're making progress to more than double our production to keep up with this demand and serve critically ill patients in need.Our valued third-party suppliers are a critical piece of this infrastructure and we work closely with them in an effort to avoid disruption. We are proactively managing capacity, assessing alternative logistic options and closely managing the supply of components. Our team's commitment to delivering life saving technologies to patients is unwavering. I also want to commend our clinical field teams for their work providing real time support for patients and frontline clinicians at this time when it's needed most. Their courage and resiliency in assisting clinicians and patients has been truly impressive. In March alone, Edwards provided clinical support for TAVR procedures in all 50 states in the U.S., and in almost 60 countries around the world.At all times, we have adhered to important measures to protect the safety of our employees, while also continuing the critical work of providing life saving technologies for patients. We'll continue to rely on trusted global health sources, governments and local hospital policies to inform our decision making. Because of our strong team and patient focused culture, I have absolute confidence in our ability to successfully navigate this unprecedented global crisis.Finally, I want to recognize the important role and impact of our charitable partners in meeting both local and global community needs at this time. To respond to these needs driven by the pandemic, the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation issued emergency grants to more than 20 partner organizations and communities where our Edwards employees live and work around the world.Additionally, Edwards is providing donations of critical care technologies during this crisis to help physicians care for underserved patients. We will stay closely connected to our charitable partners to understand other ways that we can help in our communities. Also, in the first quarter our foundation achieved its longstanding goal of screening and treating more than 1.5 million underserved people in over 35 countries, through our Every Heartbeat Matters initiative. It's truly a remarkable effort by our charitable partners, and one that inspires me personally.We're using our knowledge gained from our first phase of Every Heartbeat Matters to set a new bold goal to improve the lives of 2.5 million more underserved structural heart and critical care patients by the end of 2025.Finally, before I get into our results, it was 20 years ago this month we rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, marking the spin off from Baxter and officially beginning our journey as Edwards Lifesciences. And it's been an incredible journey and we are not done yet. Not even close. While we continue to actively monitor COVID-19 and its potential business disruptions, we remain confident in our long-term patient focused strategy and innovation pipeline. There are still many patients in need. I remain very confident in our global team and culture that once this crisis passes, and it will pass, together, we will achieve many more successes.Now turning to first quarter results. Despite challenges associated with COVID-19, we reported $1.1 billion in sales this quarter, representing 14% sales growth. In Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement or TAVR, our first quarter global sales were $742 million, up 25% on an underlying basis. Our global TAVR sales growth through early March was consistent with our strong fourth quarter global growth rate. This was dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter as procedures fell as a result of the COVID-19 disruptions. As you might expect, procedure volumes in March varied greatly by geography, even by hospital as patients and providers turned their focus to the pandemic.Estimating TAVR procedure growth is more challenging than ever in the current environment. We anticipate being able to better position -- to be in a better position to estimate TAVR procedure growth and our competitive share once the global situation begins to normalize. Globally, average selling prices were stable.In U.S., our TAVR sales grew approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Our U.S. TAVR sales growth through early March was consistent with our strong fourth quarter growth rate driven by a step up in TAVR treatments as new patients entered the system independent of their surgical risk.During the last few weeks of the quarter, procedures dropped precipitously, and were highly variable across the country.The rollout of SAPIEN 3 Ultra continued to be very positive in the first quarter and clinician feedback on improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Ultra accounted for more than 30% of our U.S. and European TAVR volumes exiting the first quarter. To ensure the safety of our employees and clinician partners from the threat of COVID-19 however, we've decided to pause proctoring of centers that are not already trained on the device. We anticipate resuming the SAPIEN 3 Ultra rollout as soon as we go back to a more stable environment.As you may recall, we committed to following the PARTNER 3 patients for 10 years and in March, the two year follow up was presented at the virtual ACC Conference. Overall, we were extremely pleased that the clinical outcomes of SAPIEN 3 in low risk patients continues to be excellent at two years.Outside the U.S. in the first quarter TAVR sales grew in the mid-teens year-over-year on an underlying basis. In Europe, Edwards' growth was even stronger than our fourth quarter and better than expected through early March, before being impacted by dramatically slower procedure growth related to COVID-19. Despite this headwind, we were encouraged by the strong adoption of TAVR across most countries.In Japan, we saw very good TAVR adoption. First quarter procedures in Japan were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19, although we expect it to negatively impact Q2 sales there.In summary, based on what we know today, we assume the impact of COVID-19 on our TAVR sales will be the most severe in the second quarter, followed by a gradual recovery in the third quarter and in fourth quarter that resembles our original expectations for sales. Although we're encouraged by recent news of improving infection rates from COVID-19, we also recognize the high degree of continued uncertainty in terms of hospital procedure volumes.We now estimate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 to be flat to 2019, with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%, versus our previous expectation of approximately 15% sales growth.However, what we know for certain is that severe aortic stenosis is relentless, and Edwards remains committed to delivering critical solutions to these patients even in the face of the extraordinary challenges caused by COVID-19. We remain confident that the opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024.In transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, first quarter global sales were approximately $10 million. From a commercial standpoint, we experienced strong momentum and accelerated adoption of PASCAL in Europe. We continue to be pleased with PASCAL's acute clinical outcomes and physician feedback remains positive. We were tracking to our expectations until the last few weeks of the quarter, when sales declined abruptly due to the impact of COVID-19.As previously announced, we've temporarily paused new enrollments in our mitral and tricuspid active pivotal clinical trials. We are coordinating closely with the trials' investigators and the decision to resume enrollment will be made in consultation with each investigator and hospital. We remain laser focused on our vision of transforming care for patients with mitral and tricuspid valvular disease by developing a portfolio of innovative therapies supported by a growing body of clinical evidence.We continue to gain experience and make meaningful progress across the portfolio and you can expect to hear informative updates regarding PASCAL, Cardioband and EVOQUE at the upcoming EuroPCR medical meeting. In Q2, we expect a significant negative impact on transcatheter mitral and tricuspid procedures as healthcare systems focus on fighting the pandemic since these procedures currently require general anesthesia and an ICU stay.We anticipate recovery beginning in Q3 and remain committed to our strategy of ensuring procedural success and differentiated patient outcomes through our high-touch support model. We are revising our revenue range to $30 million to $45 million for the full year from our previous expectation of $50 million to $70 million. We feel confident that we're well positioned to navigate and manage through these unprecedented challenges with our long-term strategy and dedicated focused team.We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity will reach approximately $3 billion by 2024 and are passionate about bringing solutions for these deadly diseases and improving patients' lives around the world. In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter sales of $193 million declined 9% on an underlying basis. As expected, driven by the rapid adoption of TAVR, the U.S. surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds experienced in the fourth quarter persisted into the first quarter.During the last few weeks of March, we experienced a sharp deceleration in procedures related to COVID-19. We remain very encouraged by the continued adoption of our premium INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, which is driving an increasing share of surgical aortic valve procedures. Based on favorable patient outcomes and positive physicians' feedback, it's not surprising that in INSPIRIS valve has become the number one implanted surgical aortic valve in the U.S. and Japan.In Europe, HARPOON, our beating heart mitral valve repair system is now available commercially and we plan to launch it as the environment stabilizes. In addition, we're also pleased to report that we recently received FDA approval to begin our U.S. pivotal IDE study and begin enrollment to begin -- and expect enrollment to begin in the second half of 2020. Recall that HARPOON offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients.In summary, because of the impact associated with COVID-19, we now expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 to decline 5% to 15% from 2019 versus our previous expectation of zero to 3% growth. Our expectation is that lower case rate at the end of Q1 in the U.S. and Europe will continue in Q2.We anticipate that our Q4 sales will return to positive growth, driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. As we move beyond COVID-19 and even as transcatheter technology expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies.To summarize, TAVR, TMTT and Surgical, as the COVID disruption subsides there ultimately are structural heart patients who delayed their treatment and will get treated. However, sadly, we expect that because of these delays, some patients will worsen and not survive the delay given the deadly nature of these chronic conditions. It's difficult to quantify the impact on patients at this time but recall data published in the Journal of Thoracic Surgery suggests that patients waiting for aortic valve replacement have a 4% mortality risk at one month, 8% at three months, and 12% after waiting six months. This is a very difficult time for structural heart patients as they weigh the risk of COVID-19 versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease.In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $183 million increased 1% on an underlying basis. Growth in the first quarter was driven by greater demand in Europe, primarily for our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices, partially offset by lower demand for our enhanced surgical recovery products. Recall that our Critical Care product line is focused on helping two distinct groups of patients. The larger of which require hemodynamic monitor -- monitoring in the surgical setting, and the smaller group who require support in the ICU.While the pandemic remains active, revenues from our enhanced surgical recovery products will be significantly lower, partially offset by increased demand for ICU products. We have also seen some delay in HemoSphere orders in the U.S., as hospitals limit their capital spending as they focus on COVID-19.In summary, because of the uncertainty related to COVID-19, we now estimate Critical Care sales growth for 2020 to be flat to 2019 with a range of minus 5% to plus 5%, versus our previous expectation of 6% to 9% growth.And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. So whether you're new to our story, or you follow the company since we went public 20 years ago, you know that our talented and dedicated team at Edwards has always put patients first. Never has this been more important than today. As we stand together with the global community, I'm grateful for our extraordinary team and our partners, and I'm optimistic about the future of continuing to deliver innovations to patients around the world.And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. So the -- it varies different as you can imagine by geography. It also varies very different by business. I can summarize it this way Bob. Q2 is going to be a really tough quarter. It's come down hard, and we're living that right now. Even the numbers that we're providing for Q2 is probably moderately better than it is right now. I might add that our structural heart businesses feel it even more acutely than our critical care business. So it's a good question, Bob. And this is very tough to do. So we know that it's challenging time to estimate revenues. We're starting to see positive signs already. And so in the tone of the tenor we really -- we hear people preparing themselves to start recovery. And we know that that's going to take some time. We also know that the diseases we treat are very serious and that we expect those diseases are not easy to postpone. And we know that many of the patients that might have been treated in Q1, Q2 and so forth, might indeed be treated in Q4. And so the combination of those factors that encourage us to say that we're likely -- and again, there's a broad range of possibilities but we're likely to be in a more typical volume situation in Q4. Yes, no, it's very real. One thing for sure David is our patients were scared. They're afraid of COVID and it's meant that they have in many cases decided to stay home. So, there's many factors that influence the recovery. But if you do think of it as a bowl, as a funnel, there's been a bunch of patients that are waiting. So beginning the screening process again, that really needs to begin months in advance of the fourth quarter, is going to be key. It's going to be a big effort by the whole community. But I think the community is going to come to grips with the fact that this these heart valve patients, and AS patients in particular, really need to be treated and that they're in a dangerous situation, and we think that they are going to respond to that.So right now, the screening rates have not returned to prior levels, not even close. But we're anticipating that that's going to happen. And that's what will cause Q4 to be what it is. Yes, thanks, David. Well, you know how we feel about SAPIEN 3 platform. We think it's outstanding and we think the PARTNER 3 study reinforced that and it's even nice to see this data that was generated at two years. But as we said, trying to estimate overall procedure growth is just really challenging right now in the current environment. We're going to be in a much better position to do that sometime in the future, but right now trying to speak to competitive share just seems inappropriate to us and will be -- make a lot more sense to do that once things normalize. Yes. So I'm going to have a little bit of a follow-up on your second question, Joanne. Let me try and get at your first one. Overall we were just -- we were extremely pleased with the outcomes of SAPIEN 3 in low risk patients at two years. Now remember what this was. This was a one -- it was a one year trial, right, with a one year endpoint. But we agreed to follow these patients for 10 years. And so you're going to get a snapshot each year into the future.Yes, the numbers did come closer together. But one of the things that's positive is numerically TAVR stays superior to surgery at two years. Then it gets -- and it's still numerically better. So the numbers are quite small at this point, Joanne. So just a couple of deaths or a couple of strokes can change that - can be the difference between statistical superiority and just being called equivalent. And so if it's very small differences, but no we weren't discouraged by that at all. We continue to be very encouraged.And your second question is about catch up and resuming normal of expected treatments. So I want to make sure that I'm answering what you're asking, Joanne. Are you asking what about the patient? Even if we catch up, there's a lot of patients that won't have been treated during 2020. Are you asking me to comment on those? Yes. So if this is a really tough time for patients. And ultimately, there may be some structural heart patients who've delayed the treatment, who never get treated. And just because of deadly nature, some are not likely to survive. If you just run the numbers here, it gets to be an extraordinary large group of patients and that distresses us greatly. It's just the difficult times, the disease is clearly progressive. And so we know about some patients already anecdotally who have passed away on the waiting list, which is very sad. But no, this is a tough time as the world has turned their attention to COVID. It's not a great set of conditions for structural heart patients. Yes, thanks. Yes, we certainly have had a lot of conversations about that. And so what I'll share here will be somewhat anecdotal. It varies a great deal by region. You can imagine the situation in New York City is very different than what you might see in other parts of the U.S. and in other parts of the world, frankly.In the U.S. there are many people that are turning their attention to trying to get back to doing procedures again. You know hospitals are very dependent on doing procedures to be able to maintain their income and they also know that there are patients out there with real needs, and so they want to get back to it. There are various state regulations that they need to work through and then there's just a lot of machinery to start again.And in our case, we have to influence patients to come in and get screened again and begin that whole process. And so when procedures stop, screening also stops. And so that's the restarting of the system that's going on right now. And it's going to take some time, but I think people are clearly motivated to get it going and it is going to be highly variable, depending on where you are. Yes, that's a challenging one for us. The way it was paused, we're going to be able to open up individual centers when they're ready. If you're going to ask us broadly, what does that mean? Probably around two quarters. It's going to -- you're going to have a site-by-site restart. But I think a fair estimate is something like that we'd be disappointed if it went much longer. And we know that we have a lot of really motivated clinical investigators who encourage us to stop, but I think they are going to be the same people that encourage us to get started again. Yes. Thanks, Rick. And as you might imagine, there is indeed a wide range of outcomes. And so although it's very hard to say, but I think there are a number of people that are going to be motivated to go. The resources and equipment to restart TAVR given the short length of stay and the fact that it doesn't need an ICU could encourage people to try and get that procedure going, particularly considering how serious AS is. And so yes, there is a scenario where it could come up faster. But the other thing that we have to be clear on is, we've watched the system really screech to a halt. And so this -- it's a restart process. And indeed, I'm sure you know from your own research that patients are scared. And so getting them to re-enter whether it's hospitals or whether hospitals create places that patients can go and feel more comfortable, this is going to be the test of getting the system restarted. It's just a -- it's a wide range of possibilities. Yes. Thanks very much, Rick. Yes, there are going to be a number of things accompanying probably a late-breaker and some oral abstracts and some posters, but probably two of that we call your attention to, on EVOQUE in the tricuspid position. I believe the early experience is going to be shared, which I believe is going to be 19 patients at 30 days. And so that will be the first time that the community has had a chance to see how that valve performs. And then in PASCAL, the CLASS study, actually the CE Mark study that evaluated both DMR and FMR patients, we will have 62 patients at one year and 109 patients at 30 days and six months. So it will be a nice informative update on those product lines for sure. Yes. Thanks, Larry. I don't have a strong view on other procedures. You know us, we're so focused on structural heart diseases, that's where we really put our energy. What we do know is that AS is particularly deadly and there is some data there that reinforces that. And so that makes us think that there is going to be a strong motivation for people to do this. And at a time when hospitals really want to get back to providing the care, and also I think they're frankly concerned about their economics, here is something that they can do that I think is really good for patients and it also helps them get back on their feet again. Yes. We're not accustomed to sort of slice it by month, Robbie, but I'll try and give you a little bit of color here. So the -- a lot of it is going to depend what COVID does itself and whether COVID keeps receding or not. Based on what we've seen so far, there needs to be improvement from where we are today to get to the middle of the range or certainly the top of the range. If we continue where we are today, we're going to be much closer to the bottom of the range. And it's just a wide range of possibilities in terms of how this quarter will play out. We probably never had a quarter that has a greater level of uncertainty as the second. Yes. And I just might add that we have tried to really focus on prioritizing and protecting our employees and their jobs and we're not planning layoffs associated with this pandemic. And as I said earlier, we continue to support cases in every state and the countries around the world and we're going to do everything we can to continue to be a great partner through this entire process. Yes. I don't have hard data on that one. We currently estimate that there is more than 700 centers and we said that -- and this was following the NCD that was approved last year that we're probably headed toward 850 in total. So I don't know the exact number to where we are right now. I can tell you that since COVID hit, we've stopped doing the training and are really focused on the existing sites. And so that's probably going to change that adoption rate to some extent. But the bigger driver in terms of the way the Q1 was going before COVID hit was new patients coming off the sidelines. And that wasn't all concentrated in new sites, that was across the board. Sure. So we would say in Europe, we saw a phenomena that was very similar to the U.S., which is a strict drop-off in March. Within Europe, some countries got hit much harder than others. But the net-net effect was Europe wasn't so different than the U.S. and we actually think that the recovery in Europe and the U.S. may not be so different. Interestingly enough, procedures in Japan in Q1 were not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. We think that there is going to be a more pronounced effect in Q2. And it just seems from our perspective that the kind of the wave of COVID-19 patients in Japan is trailing what's happening in the U.S. and Europe by a matter of maybe weeks of some sort tough to know for sure. Those are the biggest markets. I mean there are other places around the world where TAVR is still young, like Australia and Latin America where there is still growth and not much impact from COVID. But those are kind of small numbers by comparison. Yes. Sorry Raj, I mean, we're -- obviously it's premature for us to get into 2021 in a big way, but you can tell. When we say that we're going to start approaching recovery in Q4, you'd like to think that in 2021 we've got some pretty favorable comparisons. And so I would anticipate that. Yes. We don't have anything broad at this point, Raj, but we do hear anecdotal comments. I mean the physicians there are very active researchers and many of them want to start conversations about getting going again. So there's a few anecdotal conversations about that, but really no hard data about how Germany will start up. Sure. Yes, thanks, Vijay. So there's a lot of data on bicuspid and there has been some extensive published real world experiences. At Edwards, you know we're not contraindicated for these patients that we treat bicuspid patients with SAPIEN valves all the time. And our real world outcomes and these patients have been outstanding with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3. So we think that body of evidence is just going to grow and we expect there will be more data at cardiology conferences in the future. Your other question was about the IP. Yes, so big picture, I think we believe that our IP positions and we're prepared to defend them. We don't believe litigations necessarily in the best interest of patients, and we're going to hope that we can move through this. But there is a lot of litigation going on in a lot of countries with a lot of dates. And so it will be a continued source of noise at this point. So you're right. Danielle. Certainly, there are very sick patients that aren't being done, right, we're not doing zero. But it's much lower than we expected to be doing at this time. And what I was trying to express, if you just think about it in a growth sense and it's a little bit dehumanizing. But if you think about what we were going to do and how many patients we're going to be treated during 2020 compared to the number of patients that we believe we're going to treat now, it's a much smaller number and that's a deep concern. We know that many AS patients do not get treated. And that's why that's actually one of the reasons why we are so enthusiastic about our work because we can get after this population that's not treated. So that pool of untreated patients just gets bigger, and we know that there is mortality associated with that. Thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Diego, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, our Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards released fourth quarter 2021 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities; regulatory approvals; clinical trials; litigation; reimbursement; competitive matters; and foreign currency fluctuations. These speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update these statements after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. We\u2019re proud of our performance in 2021. Although, hospitals continued to be impacted by COVID, it was a year of significant milestones and investment for Edwards and our teams were relentless. In TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. In particular, we invested in increasing awareness, pursued further therapy expansion and advance new technologies. We completed enrollment of the EARLY TAVR trial, an important pivotal study studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before their symptoms develop. Separately, we initiated enrollment in our PROGRESS trial for moderate AS patients, and we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to start our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. In TMTT, we achieved our significant 2021 milestones, as we continue to make meaningful progress on advancing our three key value drivers: a portfolio of pioneering therapies for patients; positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. We are pleased to have treated over 3,000 patients in 2021 with our differentiated portfolio of TMTT therapies, gaining valuable learnings through both our clinical and commercial experiences. Each of our platforms demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance. I'm also pleased to announce that we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial in 2021, an important milestone that keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the adoption of our premium technologies. We also implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring advancements in critical care. Most importantly in 2021, even more patients benefited from Edwards' life-saving technologies than ever before. I'm also proud to say that throughout the year, our employees remain dedicated to keeping our commitments to patients and to one another. Despite the ongoing pandemic that fueled global challenges, our employees found innovative ways to support hospital procedures and to ensure our ability to supply our life-saving therapies was not impacted. And through their efforts, we were able to get our technologies into the hands of our trusted partners around the world so they could serve their patients. Now I'd like to cover several 2021 financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details. In 2021, we are pleased to achieve all of our key financial expectations. Underlying sales increased 18% to $5.2 billion, driven by balanced organic sales growth in each region. We achieved 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, while also increasing R&D, 19%. The significant increase in R&D and infrastructure investments this year helped strengthen our long-term outlook. And as you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity we have to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care system. Turning to our financial results. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies, although at the lower end of our October expectations due to the pronounced impact of Omicron on hospital resources in December, especially in the US. Full year 2021 global TAVR sales of $3.4 billion increased 18% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Despite intermittent challenges associated with the pandemic throughout the year, sales were in line with our original guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion and were driven by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with our SAPIEN platform. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales were $872 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength outside the US. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable as we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy. In the US, our TAVR sales grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, the Omicron variant had a noticeable impact on hospital resources in December as cases were postponed or limited in a number of hospitals. Growth in the US was highest in small to mid volume centers, which are helping provide access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. Outside the US, in the fourth quarter our sales grew approximately 20% year-over-year on an underlying basis and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions. In Europe, Edwards' growth was in the mid-teens, and we estimate that our competitive position was stable. Growth was broad-based across the region. It's worth noting that a recent cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically dominant when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating French patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at low surgical mortality -- who are at low risk of surgical mortality. We're also encouraged by the recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, which now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over 75. We believe both of these developments represents an important long-term opportunity to bring TAVR therapy to even more patients in need. Sales growth in Japan was also strong, where therapy adoption is still relatively low. Several important milestones were achieved in Q4. For the first time, the number of TAVR procedures performed in Japan was comparable with the surgical aortic valve replacements. Furthermore, in each prefecture in Japan, there is now at least one hospital offering SAPIEN. Following the recent reimbursement approval for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. In addition to our geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. In Q4, we completed enrollment of our EARLY-TAVR pivotal trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic AS patients. Separately, we initiated enrollment in PROGRESS, an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment before they have symptoms or before their AS becomes severe rather than risking irreversible damage to their heart as the disease progresses. We also took steps to advance our innovative product portfolio. In Q4, we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study our next-generation TAVR device, SAPIEN X4. Additionally, in Q4, we received FDA approval to use SAPIEN 3 with our Alterra adaptive pre-stent for congenital heart patients. This should result in a quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that these younger patients will require over their lifetime. In summary, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, we continue to anticipate 2022 underlying TAVR sales growth of 12% to 15%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. Our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges early in 2022, turning to more normalized growth environment as headwinds from Omicron subside and hospital resource constraints stabilize. We remain confident in this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Turning to TMTT. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we completed enrollment of our Class IID pivotal trial, and we remain on track to present data in the second half of 2022. This important milestone keeps us on track for US approval late this year of PASCAL for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. We also continue to expect European approval of our next-generation PASCAL Precision System later this year. At the PCR London Valves conference in Q4, PASCAL 30-day outcomes from our MiCLASP post-market approval study of more than 250 patients in Europe were presented. The data highlighted safe and effective MR reduction in a post-market setting. We also progressed on the enrollment of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease. In mitral replacement, we continue to expand our experience with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. Early experience with these sub-French transfemoral therapies increase our confidence in both platforms. Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies, results from the TRISCEND study were presented at the Annual TCT Conference in November and demonstrated that early patient outcomes with the EVOQUE tricuspid were favorable and sustained at six months. We are encouraged by the procedural success rates and also the significant TR reduction and sustained improvements in quality of life measures experienced by these patients. We continue to make meaningful progress in enrolling our two tricuspid pivotal trials, the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system and the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We anticipate a late 2022 approval of EVOQUE tricuspid in Europe and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients that have very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter revenue of $25 million grew sequentially from the third quarter, as we saw increased adoption of the PASCAL system despite the negative COVID impact in December. Full year 2021 global sales more than doubled to $86 million. As we continue to expand the availability of PASCAL to more centers in Europe, we are pleased with the excellent outcomes for patients supported by our high-touch model. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease in 2022, with the milestones that we outlined in our recent investor conference. Despite the COVID impact so far this year, we continue to expect TMTT sales of $140 million to $170 million for 2022. We estimate the global TMTT opportunity will grow to approximately $5 billion by 2028, and we remain committed to bringing our groundbreaking portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases. We are confident our portfolio strategy positions us well for leadership. In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $889 million, up 15% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2021 global sales of $221 million increased 9% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Although, we saw that hospital staffing shortages continued to worsen throughout the quarter, especially in the US, life-saving surgical therapies continue to be prioritized over elective procedures. We're excited about the continued global adoption of INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA valve. We remain encouraged by the growing evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including 2 studies being presented at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Conference this weekend. The COMMENCE study demonstrates excellent hemodynamics of this tissue technology across all aortic valve sizes at 5 years. While a European economic value study shows a cost reduction with the use of INSPIRIS versus mechanical valves. In summary, we continue to expect that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid single digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by adoption of our premium technologies and procedure growth. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients, extend our global leadership and be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $835 million increased 14% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. 2021 growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales as capital spending resumed. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU also remained in high demand due to the elevated COVID hospitalizations in both the US and Europe. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $212 million increased 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong demand for HemoSphere. Demand for our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors also remained robust in the fourth quarter, including ClearSight, our noninvasive finger cuff, which achieved sustained performance at or above pre-COVID levels. As discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of a full range of technologies creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, and we remain excited about our pipeline of innovative critical care products. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2021, including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of this year. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 12.6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.53. Our fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by the wave of COVID that began late in the quarter, especially in the US. Earnings per share in the quarter was below our expectations as it was impacted by weaker-than-expected sales and we accelerated certain spending into the fourth quarter of 2021 that we had planned to incur during 2022, including preparation for TMTT product launches. For the full year 2021, we are pleased with our performance as sales increased 18% on an underlying basis to $5.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $2.22. I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2022. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 75.3% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This year, our rate should be lifted by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and an improved product mix, partially offset by investments in our manufacturing capacity. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $424 million or 31.9% of sales compared to $339 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by the resumption of medical congresses and commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year as well as the addition of personnel in preparation for new product launches. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 30%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 19% to $233 million or 17.5% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased TMTT clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth. During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $18 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects an accounting adjustment associated with reduced expectations of making a future milestone payment for a previous acquisition. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.9% or 12.7%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included an approximate three percentage point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.6%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2022 to be between 11% and 15%, which includes an estimated benefit of three percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales by approximately 1% or $10 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million negative impact or about 2% to full year 2022 sales as compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $284 defined as cash flow from operating activities of $374 million, less capital spending of $90 million. Full year 2021 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up from $734 million in 2020. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow to be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. In 2022, we expect our cash flow will be reduced by approximately $200 million due to a change in tax regulations involving the timing of the deductions for research and development expenses. Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the year. Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased approximately $100 million during the fourth quarter. We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $1.1 billion. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were $632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $630 million and $635. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2022. Despite a slow start to the year associated with Omicron's impact on hospital resources, we are planning for conditions to gradually improve and therefore, are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2022. For total Edwards, we continue to expect sales to grow at a low double-digit rate to $5.5 billion to $6 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.7 billion to $4 billion. And for TMTT, we expect sales of $140 million to $170 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.65. For the first quarter of 2022, we project total sales to be between $1.27 billion and $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.62. And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. So in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in 2021, advancing new transformational therapies and delivering strong financial performance. We expect continued growth and progress in 2022. We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well long-term success. As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the number one largest health burden, we believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028. We are confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and the health care system. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Mike. With that, we're ready to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting our question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start first, a little more color on fourth quarter and first quarter assumptions. US TAVR came in a little lighter than expected, I don't think it's a huge surprise, given all the commentary and trends we're hearing with Omicron late in the quarter. But maybe just walk us through what you saw throughout fourth quarter? What you're seeing in first quarter and what you're assuming for the balance of first quarter?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So yes, fourth quarter started very nicely. We saw a nice momentum in October and November, and we really saw a very strong impact in December. So, it was primarily focused in the US, and it was centered around really hospital capacity. They really -- they reached their limits in many cases and started deferring procedures. We've seen that continue to lead to a slow start in 2022. So at this point, I would say sales are below what we would have typically expected for a start, probably more in line with the kind of thing that we saw towards the end of December. But having said that, our assumptions are that we're going to see more normalized growth as the hospital resource constraints stabilize. And so as Omicron we think, comes down pretty hard, we think that our full year sales guidance is still in place on our best estimate.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. And then maybe I'll do a follow-up question to that. As we think about the balance of the year, how should we think about the cadence throughout first quarter came in, as you mentioned, under pressure a bit here, lower than where we were thinking. Maybe just walk us through how we should think about as a framework for the rest of the year? And what are the assumptions underlying that? Appreciate it. Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It's -- we don't have great visibility to exactly what backlogs look like or what the patient flow might be. So at this point, we assume that many of the patients that are having procedures postponed or deferred are going to come back. It's not clear to us what month or what quarter we're going to see it. In our assumptions, Robbie, is that by the end of the year, that we would see all the COVID-related delays sort of return to the system.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up, Mike, on the previous question in Q4. Why was -- it was a tale of two geographies, right? OUS was strong, US was soft. Why do you think the TAVR business was more impacted in the US than OUS? And I had one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks for that, Larry. Yes, there \u2013 I think actually it was clearer than you think. Omicron hit the US pretty hard, and it hit it in large population centers. We saw it across the East Coast, we saw it in the Midwest. You know all the places that it was seen. And so we felt a pretty profound impact. In Europe, it was not the case. So although the UK experienced Omicron, most of Continental Europe just didn't see it in Q4. And so it was a very different picture. I think that was the primary reason. Same thing in the rest of the globe, I would argue, right?\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Mike, just looking ahead, you completed the Class IID trial, which is degenerative MR. Obviously, how do you think physicians will use the product when it's approved? Do you think people will stick to the label? Do you think people will use it off-label for FMR, or do you think -- how do you think people will use it once it's approved for DMR? Thanks for taking the question.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Yes. Thanks very much. You know how we deploy these technologies. We're very hands on with them. We use a high-touch model and really try and guide clinicians to do what's right. So, we expect them clearly to be on label. That's the way that we're going to conduct our business. We're going to roll out to people that have experience that we think are very serious about treating mitral disease. And so we think it's going to be one that stays inbounds.\nLarry Biegelsen: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, maybe on one on the -- just guidance, right, I think, or perhaps a small for Scott question. I think in the past, you guys -- when you've given the guidance you said, look, it's prudent to be at the midpoint of the range. Given Q1 is about $50 million below Street numbers, perhaps, should we be now thinking about bottom half of that range? Would that be more appropriate?\nScott Ullem: Well, yes, Vijay, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. It's a little early to talk about where the full year is going to come in again, just because of the uncertainty of Omicron and how quickly it's going to fall off. Certainly, we feel like early prospects are different than we thought back last month at our investor conference. So, yes, we'd probably model that a little bit lower in the range. But keep in mind, because the fourth quarter came in a little bit lower, that brings us up a little bit in the range. So, still for modeling purposes, the middle of the range is probably a good place to settle.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, I'll just add to that. I mean, if you want to think about some, just watch the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system and on hospitals in particular. So, if that goes better, then probably has a better chance that our patients flow through faster. And if it's a greater burden have the opposite impact. So, at this point, we still think there's balanced risk in there, but a lot of it is going to depend on whether things transpire the way that we anticipate.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Mike. And maybe one follow-up. I think you call out Europe as mid-teens. Japan up strong double-digits. I'm curious, given at the low-risk approval or I guess the receipt of reimbursement in Japan, were there any stocking orders that benefited Q4, or perhaps is this real underlying procedures in the implications Japan should continue to be strong for the balance of the year?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. So, no, clearly, what we felt like we saw OUS was not a result of any kind of stocking. These were real procedures that got done and that holds true Europe, Japan or elsewhere outside the US. Was there more to the question than that, Vijay?\nVijay Kumar: No, I was just curious. So, it implies basically Japan now should be strong for the balance of the year under certain variant, I guess?\nMike Mussallem: Well, yes, I mean it's -- it remains to be seen exactly how this variant is going to affect the rest of the world. There's one argument that say, hey, it's a little delayed and so it will come a little bit later. But then again, it may not have the same impact because of a lot of reasons, whether it's seasonality or vaccination rates or their own safety protocols. So, a little tough to predict how it's going to roll out. But overall, we've modeled probably a little more growth OUS than US for 2022.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon or good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I'm interested in the comment that you made, if I heard it correctly, that you accelerated spending in the fourth quarter for TMTT that you had expected in 2022. So that if you're planning for U.S. launch near the end of the year would have been pretty far in advance. So should I assume that's mostly outside the United States? And what was the motivation to accelerate that spending into the fourth quarter?\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne, for the question. So there are a couple of things going on. And we are continuing to invest in our field force, as we continue to expand to new sites in Europe. And so that's a piece of the spending that we're doing. We're also starting to build resources in the states. So it takes a while to get ready for product launch, and we're taking very seriously getting the right team in place, making sure that training is robust and that we're ready to go when the time comes. There were some other things that happened in terms of just being ready for doing things like grants, market research, some of the patient awareness initiatives and starting to fund those in the fourth quarter is also an important part of teeing up TMTT and TAVR for continued growth in 2022 and beyond.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excellent. And then my follow-up question has to do with the backlog. I appreciate a part can measure that. But is there any reason that we shouldn't see patients come back maybe in the second quarter the way we saw last year?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne. We remember that very well as well. We saw some pretty incredible surge that we really didn't expect in the second quarter. But I'll remind you, 2021 was a different picture than right now. It wasn\u2019t Omicron. It was a different variant. Hospitals were probably in a little different position. They weren't dealing with the constraints associated with labor. And I think as you know, there's widespread nursing shortages. We think that all gets worked out over time. We think hospitals have a lot of sophistication. They're going to triage their systems and their staffing measures and ultimately find ways to treat the patients that are most in need. So we think that all gets worked out. But whether it pops in Q2, we're more hesitant than that. We really think it's going to be more of a gradual recovery.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Just -- I know you're getting a lot of questions on capacity and some of the issues that are constraining the market, but on that topic, can you talk maybe just a little bit about some of the things you mentioned, Mike, about the impact of labor constraints on different types of centers and maybe coming at the guidance question from another direction, what gives you the confidence that these things will get better, like that you're not going to be sort of constrained by nursing shortages and staff, et cetera, for the brunt of the year? And I have one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Well, thanks, Matt. And there isn't perfect certainty here, but we get a lot of anecdotal information, and we're obviously very close to our customers. It -- the situation now and as we've gone through it in December and January here, feels very different than the early stages of the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, not only did hospitals sort of shut down and close their doors, but there were patients that were very concerned, that stayed out of the system. And I'll remind you that the patients that Edwards serves are exactly the patients that are most vulnerable to COVID. And so, we sort of had the double whammy, if you will, in 2020. What we feel now is it's less about the patient behavior and more about hospitals' ability to be able to do the cases. So do we hear anecdotal notes and again, I don't have perfect information for you, Matt, but things like hospitals saying, you know what, we're just going to limit to a certain number of procedures per week or we're going to postpone procedures until next month or we're going to involve our Chief Medical Officer, and he's going to look at all the procedures that need to be done and decide in triage them and decide which ones they'll do now and which ones they do later. So you have a variety actions that hospitals are taking. But we think that the patients are there. And so that's why we feel pretty comfortable staying with our current guidance. We don't have perfect visibility, of course, Matt, but that's behind our thinking.\nMatt Miksic: Sure. And then just on that same topic of resources. One of the things that you've talked about over the past several years is this shift to more efficient procedures, light sedation and wondering if you're seeing the resource environment drive adoption there, or is that one of the levers that folks are pulling on a little harder to get more patients through the system with fewer resources?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. I think the hospitals think about that deeply, Matt, and it is a big plus if they believe that the patients don't need to consume an ICU bed and so forth or even impact hospital occupancy. So, I think it all goes into the math of those folks that are managing hospitals. But even more important for them is they're trying to serve patients properly. They're trying to think about which patients are in greater risk and how to move them through the system. So it's complex and it's highly different from hospital to hospital and region to region, Matt. So it's -- there's a pretty good variance out there, if you will. But in total, I think it's all incorporated in our guidance.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead with your question. \nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just two on the CLASS II program. Just first to follow Larry\u2019s question. Our checks around from the MitraClip product to approval for FMR. And reimbursement suggested that up to 20% of FMR cases are mixed ideology and have a degenerative component. Mike, just to circle back on your answer about staying on label, were those patients of mixed ideology be on label, if they do have degenerative component?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So I think much of this is going to be physicians making that judgment. And so when it's all -- when it actually comes down to it, the physician is going to be looking at this patient, they're going to realize that our PASCAL device is only approved for degenerative and they'll have to look at this particular patient and use their own judgment. We think, by and large, they're going to stay on label, but as you say, there are mixed patients. And so there's going to be some of that, that I'm sure physicians are going to have to just work through.\nJosh Jennings: Great. And then just on the CLASP IID and CLASP IIF, were there any design modifications because of COVID or already prespecified analyses that have been incorporated in the trial design, or because it's their head-to-head trials against MitraClip, that randomization takes any COVID-related risk off the table? Thanks for taking the question.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks very much, Josh. We typically just don't go into some of the particulars associated with the regulatory process. It tends to be complex. There's a lot of nuance to it. And I think it would just be confusing if we went into all that. And so we really -- don't have anything new to share.\nJoshua Jennings: Okay. Understood.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up and just ask CLASP IIF and CLASP IITR, just what you've seen from an enrollment standpoint recently, and alongside that, how you're thinking about SAPIEN X4 and enrollment in that program commencing?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. So, Cecilia, we'll start off by saying, clearly, many of the same sites that we're doing CLASP IID were involved in CLASP IIF and CLASP IITR. And so having completed enrollment in CLASP IID does mean that they probably will turn some of their attention to IIF and IITR. And so I think it's likely to be -- it's only human, it's only likely to be a boost to that. I don't think it's going to have real impact on the completion of the trial. So, -- but we're hopeful that things go well here. Of course, these same groups are working with trying to get through Omicron, which is no picnic, but we're hopeful that's short-lived. As it relates to the SAPIEN X4 or the ALLIANCE trial, remember, this is a new valve. And so this isn't simply a case of, boy, I'm just going to take all my SAPIEN 3 patients and just put this new valve. And it really is a very novel valve system. And so this is going to be one that we do with a great deal of deliberateness. And so it's going to -- there's going to be a learning curve associated with this, and so we're just going to have to work through it. We really don't have a prediction on how fast that will enroll at this time.\nCecilia Furlong: Okay. Thank you, Mike. And to follow-up as well. I'm just curious, if you could talk about just TAVR in China, what you've been able to do recently with COVID hopefully pulling back in the near-term, how do you think about the opportunity to really start developing that market over the next year? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. We're really looking forward to developing the market in China. And as you say, COVID has been a real setback in that regard because often, if we are launching a new country like that, we would bring a lot of experts from Edwards, key opinion leaders, and there virtually is no travel to China right now. So, it's just been our local team that's doing that, which doesn't make it any easier. We're excited about it. We know this too shall pass and we'll move on to it. And we're really looking forward to bringing truly premium technology to China. Well, I'm sorry, there was a -- let's see. I think that's probably -- does that answer your question, Cecilia? Yes.\nCecilia Furlong: It does, Mike. Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, god afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a question on PASCAL and how to think about the go-to-market strategy here in the US. In Europe, you guys have obviously been getting a price premium. The trial powered for non-inferiority, so I'm curious if you could might comment a little bit more on how you expect to get a premium here as well in the US, or if we should be thinking about that a little bit differently? Are there things that we could look for in the data when we do see it, that could give us a little bit more comfort that you will be able to successfully get that premium? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks Danielle. I mean, first and foremost, when we come to the US, we're going to do -- we're going to run some of the exact same playbook that we have in Europe, which is to really focus on physician training, getting great real-world results, making sure that we get patient -- excellent patient outcomes every time we do this. We're going to probably tend to be staying in the places where people have real experience. I don't know that we have a pricing policy that's been established for the U.S. launch at this point. And so we'll tell you about that once it's clear. But our focus is going to be on doing great cases for a while.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, my other question is around PASCAL in the U.S. and go-to-market. How to think about leveraging? I know you guys are -- I believe you guys are building a separate sales force here, but how you might be able to leverage your presence. You have very strong presence in TAVR at a lot of these centers, and there's a lot of overlap. How can we think about sales synergies or sort of a halo effect on both ends, whether it's for TAVR or for PASCAL from a market share perspective? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I think you know the way that we've approached this across the board, is we really feel like the TAVR has a long way to go, and a lot of growth in front of it, and deserves a great dedicated team and TMTT opportunity is a very large one. And so the way we've gone at this is decide that we're going to have a dedicated team. Is there some halo that comes from the Edwards brand and so forth, I'd like to think so. Of course, we try and maintain a great reputation, but we don't go into it thinking about leverage so much or it's our bundled sales. That's really not our approach. We're going to sell on really trying to do spectacular procedures and get great outcomes.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon, everyone. Can you hear me all right, Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, we hear you, Suraj.\nSuraj Kalia: Perfect. So Mike, I just wanted to follow up on Josh's question about CLASP IID, will there be any paired analysis presented in terms of the types of devices, i.e., MitraClips used and the number of devices used per case?\nMike Mussallem: So Suraj, I'm not sure exactly what's going to be presented, but I would expect that you're going to see a pretty fulsome presentation of the data when it finally does get presented. We've said that that's going to happen in the second half of 2022. And when that happens, I think you're going to get a lot of information. You'll see almost everything related to device performance when that's presented.\nSuraj Kalia: Fair enough, Mike. And my follow-up, for the $10 billion by 2028, how does the pie chart look for symptomatic severe, asymptomatic severe and moderate? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. So we don't have perfect clarity on what It's going to look like in 2028. But I can tell you basically what's in our assumptions. The great bulk of this is going to be people with symptoms, with severe AS. And I don't know what percentage that is, but it is the overwhelmingly large percentage. We think that there'll be a small portion of it, which will be asymptomatic patients that are severe. We have assumed that moderate AS patients are really not much in that number. It's really negligible. And so, not really in the number at all. And so hopefully, that gives you a sense for it.\nSuraj Kalia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to ask you a little bit more about this US, OUS dynamic. I know some of it may be short-term disruption difference, but there's been notable kind of resurgence or a renaissance in international growth. And I was wondering if you could talk more about that. Are you opening more centers? Is it improved acceptance of the therapy? And what does that mean for international growth over the next couple of years versus US growth? Do you think it could outgrow the US? Should they be close to each other? Any thoughts on that would be appreciated?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Those are all really good questions. And one thing to keep in mind is, the growth rates are all comparable to last year's growth rate, which was less than normal because it was also impacted by the pandemic. So we've been super impressed about what's going on in Europe right now. This mid-teens growth because here's technology that was improved in Europe in 2007 and to be growing at a mid-teens growth rate right now is very encouraging. And it speaks to the strength of TAVR. I mean, Europe has never had -- broadly across Europe, let's put it this way, they've never had -- so for example, TAVR per million population over 65 has been lower in Europe. Pretty good in Germany, but the rest of the country is behind. So there's been some catch-up. When we talk about Japan, we say the same thing, pretty routinely that they really probably should be doing more TAVR and have more disease. And so there's quite a bit of catch-up to go on. So there really is a big opportunity. And part of what we may be seeing is just health care systems that have typically been a little slower to adapt are coming around and fueling the growth that's a little higher. And at the same time, you have to say Omicron did hit US pretty hard.\nMatt Taylor: Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. I will let some other chip in. Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nChris Pasquale: Mike, I just wanted to follow up on Cecilia's question about ALLIANCE. I don't think it's been post year. Could you just tell us a little bit about the design of that trial, number of patients, length of follow-up, things like that?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. I don't -- the short answer is I'm not prepared to talk about that at this point, Chris. I think there may be some similarities to past trials, but I don't have the specifics on it. So we're going to have to get that to you at a later date here because it's just I don't have that available now.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. No problem. And then, Mike, I think I heard you say that TAVR volume in Japan has now caught up with surgical volumes. It seems like you may have hit that milestone a little faster there than you did looking at the experiences in the US or Europe. Can you talk a little bit about how market development is going there? It seems like it may have hit a bit of an inflection, maybe over the past year with low risk coming online?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So thanks. For us, it doesn't feel like it's come really fast. It feels like it's come slower. We think that TAVR should be really popular in Japan, where surgery is not necessarily a preferred therapy and a great interventional procedure should have gone. There are a number of reasons that sort of slowed it down, they had tighter regulations. So for example, they limited TAVR to hybrid ORs. They required approvals by national bodies. But at the same time, there have been some really positive developments in Japan. So now that we have low-risk approval, it's really streamlined the pride and it's reimbursed, that streamlined the process for these patients to receive therapy. And so that was a big one. And slowly, but surely, there have been more centers that were added so that it covers the geography a little better. So, there's some positives there. And we're catching up. We're excited about the growth rate. But in our eyes, it should have happened sooner.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones. I'll go off script and ask a Critical Care question. The segment had a decent capital component. I'm just wondering, with labor becoming a bigger issue at hospitals over the last couple of months, is your view on the environment for capital changed at all?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, it's a good question. Remember, when the pandemic hit and hospitals were in trouble, they really pulled back on capital spending. We saw that even most dramatically in the US. And that continued into early 2021, but it started subsiding, and we saw hospitals started recapitalizing, if you will, and we were the beneficiary of that during 2021 and even saw that affect our performance in the fourth quarter. And we've got this modern HemoSphere technology, which is really a step forward for these patients and brings together a lot of our advanced technology for patients that are needing a great recovery. So, the combination of those have been really helpful.\nJayson Bedford: So, is 2022 still a conducive environment for capital itself?\nMike Mussallem: It is. We think it's still a very conducive environment. Some of our people wonder whether 2022 will measure up to 2021 because it felt like 2021 might have had a little catch-up in it. So, that makes them nervous about being too bullish. But we think it's going to be a more normalized year.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just quickly for Scott. Scott, in describing the factors impacting gross margin, you didn't mention inflationary pressures. And just wondering, are you not seeing it or is it just not material to the business right now?\nScott Ullem: Thanks for the question. We are seeing inflationary pressures in a couple of areas. One is just wage then, of course, materials and supplies. And so we're managing through those. Our biggest priority has been making sure that we can deliver our finished goods, our life-saving therapies to hospitals around the world. And we're really proud of our global supply chain team that's been able to navigate the challenges from shortages to logistics and still continue to be able to meet demand. And so we'll deal with the inflation. It's in our 78% to 79% gross margin guidance for the year, but we're feeling like we know what needs to get done.\nJayson Bedford: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nPito Chickering: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. To follow-up on the US TAVR questions, can you help us understand why in the third quarter, we saw hospitals near capacity for nearly two months in August and September, whereas COVID only impacted fourth quarter by a few weeks in December? Just if you can provide any more color on sort of why fourth quarter slowed sequentially versus the third quarter?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, you're going to test my COVID memory a little bit here. But we felt like we were recovering from Delta. And so it had a pretty significant impact in the third quarter and that was being mitigated, to some extent, it was improving in October and improving in November. And then Omicron showed up and it changed the trend. So, that was that we were -- we went from recovering from Delta to being impacted hard and quick by Omicron.\nPito Chickering: Okay. And then a follow-up question for Scott. Like you talked about pulling forward SG&A investments from 2022 into fourth quarter in preparation of these product launches. So if you think about a similar dollar amounts for SG&A spending going into the first quarter and you start to get leverage on that as revenues increase after first quarter to get to your guidance range of 28% to 30%? Thanks so much guys.\nScott Ullem: Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean you can tell from our guidance, where the midpoint of our sales guidance is, call it, $1.315 billion, which is a little bit lower than our fourth quarter sales and yet our EPS were forecasting in a higher range. And so, the difference is going to be really in the cost lines. And we think that a lot of the SG&A that we pulled forward in the fourth quarter will probably not show up in the first quarter as a result. And that's really the biggest driver of the increase in EPS that we're expecting and guiding to in Q1.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Okay, all. Thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2021, including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of this year. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 12.6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.53. Our fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by the wave of COVID that began late in the quarter, especially in the US. Earnings per share in the quarter was below our expectations as it was impacted by weaker-than-expected sales and we accelerated certain spending into the fourth quarter of 2021 that we had planned to incur during 2022, including preparation for TMTT product launches. For the full year 2021, we are pleased with our performance as sales increased 18% on an underlying basis to $5.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $2.22. I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2022. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 75.3% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This year, our rate should be lifted by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and an improved product mix, partially offset by investments in our manufacturing capacity. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $424 million or 31.9% of sales compared to $339 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by the resumption of medical congresses and commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year as well as the addition of personnel in preparation for new product launches. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 30%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 19% to $233 million or 17.5% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased TMTT clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth. During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $18 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects an accounting adjustment associated with reduced expectations of making a future milestone payment for a previous acquisition. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.9% or 12.7%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included an approximate three percentage point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.6%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2022 to be between 11% and 15%, which includes an estimated benefit of three percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales by approximately 1% or $10 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million negative impact or about 2% to full year 2022 sales as compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $284 defined as cash flow from operating activities of $374 million, less capital spending of $90 million. Full year 2021 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up from $734 million in 2020. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow to be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. In 2022, we expect our cash flow will be reduced by approximately $200 million due to a change in tax regulations involving the timing of the deductions for research and development expenses. Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the year. Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased approximately $100 million during the fourth quarter. We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $1.1 billion. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were $632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $630 million and $635. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2022. Despite a slow start to the year associated with Omicron's impact on hospital resources, we are planning for conditions to gradually improve and therefore, are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2022. For total Edwards, we continue to expect sales to grow at a low double-digit rate to $5.5 billion to $6 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.7 billion to $4 billion. And for TMTT, we expect sales of $140 million to $170 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.65. For the first quarter of 2022, we project total sales to be between $1.27 billion and $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.62. And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike. Well, yes, Vijay, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. It's a little early to talk about where the full year is going to come in again, just because of the uncertainty of Omicron and how quickly it's going to fall off. Certainly, we feel like early prospects are different than we thought back last month at our investor conference. So, yes, we'd probably model that a little bit lower in the range. But keep in mind, because the fourth quarter came in a little bit lower, that brings us up a little bit in the range. So, still for modeling purposes, the middle of the range is probably a good place to settle. Yes. Thanks, Joanne, for the question. So there are a couple of things going on. And we are continuing to invest in our field force, as we continue to expand to new sites in Europe. And so that's a piece of the spending that we're doing. We're also starting to build resources in the states. So it takes a while to get ready for product launch, and we're taking very seriously getting the right team in place, making sure that training is robust and that we're ready to go when the time comes. There were some other things that happened in terms of just being ready for doing things like grants, market research, some of the patient awareness initiatives and starting to fund those in the fourth quarter is also an important part of teeing up TMTT and TAVR for continued growth in 2022 and beyond. Thanks for the question. We are seeing inflationary pressures in a couple of areas. One is just wage then, of course, materials and supplies. And so we're managing through those. Our biggest priority has been making sure that we can deliver our finished goods, our life-saving therapies to hospitals around the world. And we're really proud of our global supply chain team that's been able to navigate the challenges from shortages to logistics and still continue to be able to meet demand. And so we'll deal with the inflation. It's in our 78% to 79% gross margin guidance for the year, but we're feeling like we know what needs to get done. Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean you can tell from our guidance, where the midpoint of our sales guidance is, call it, $1.315 billion, which is a little bit lower than our fourth quarter sales and yet our EPS were forecasting in a higher range. And so, the difference is going to be really in the cost lines. And we think that a lot of the SG&A that we pulled forward in the fourth quarter will probably not show up in the first quarter as a result. And that's really the biggest driver of the increase in EPS that we're expecting and guiding to in Q1."

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We're proud of our performance in 2021. Although, hospitals continued to be impacted by COVID, it was a year of significant milestones and investment for Edwards and our teams were relentless. In TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. In particular, we invested in increasing awareness, pursued further therapy expansion and advance new technologies. We completed enrollment of the EARLY TAVR trial, an important pivotal study studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before their symptoms develop. Separately, we initiated enrollment in our PROGRESS trial for moderate AS patients, and we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to start our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. In TMTT, we achieved our significant 2021 milestones, as we continue to make meaningful progress on advancing our three key value drivers: a portfolio of pioneering therapies for patients; positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. We are pleased to have treated over 3,000 patients in 2021 with our differentiated portfolio of TMTT therapies, gaining valuable learnings through both our clinical and commercial experiences. Each of our platforms demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance. I'm also pleased to announce that we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial in 2021, an important milestone that keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the adoption of our premium technologies. We also implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring advancements in critical care. Most importantly in 2021, even more patients benefited from Edwards' life-saving technologies than ever before. I'm also proud to say that throughout the year, our employees remain dedicated to keeping our commitments to patients and to one another. Despite the ongoing pandemic that fueled global challenges, our employees found innovative ways to support hospital procedures and to ensure our ability to supply our life-saving therapies was not impacted. And through their efforts, we were able to get our technologies into the hands of our trusted partners around the world so they could serve their patients. Now I'd like to cover several 2021 financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details. In 2021, we are pleased to achieve all of our key financial expectations. Underlying sales increased 18% to $5.2 billion, driven by balanced organic sales growth in each region. We achieved 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, while also increasing R&D, 19%. The significant increase in R&D and infrastructure investments this year helped strengthen our long-term outlook. And as you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity we have to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care system. Turning to our financial results. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies, although at the lower end of our October expectations due to the pronounced impact of Omicron on hospital resources in December, especially in the US. Full year 2021 global TAVR sales of $3.4 billion increased 18% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Despite intermittent challenges associated with the pandemic throughout the year, sales were in line with our original guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion and were driven by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with our SAPIEN platform. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales were $872 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength outside the US. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable as we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy. In the US, our TAVR sales grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, the Omicron variant had a noticeable impact on hospital resources in December as cases were postponed or limited in a number of hospitals. Growth in the US was highest in small to mid volume centers, which are helping provide access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. Outside the US, in the fourth quarter our sales grew approximately 20% year-over-year on an underlying basis and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions. In Europe, Edwards' growth was in the mid-teens, and we estimate that our competitive position was stable. Growth was broad-based across the region. It's worth noting that a recent cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically dominant when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating French patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at low surgical mortality -- who are at low risk of surgical mortality. We're also encouraged by the recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, which now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over 75. We believe both of these developments represents an important long-term opportunity to bring TAVR therapy to even more patients in need. Sales growth in Japan was also strong, where therapy adoption is still relatively low. Several important milestones were achieved in Q4. For the first time, the number of TAVR procedures performed in Japan was comparable with the surgical aortic valve replacements. Furthermore, in each prefecture in Japan, there is now at least one hospital offering SAPIEN. Following the recent reimbursement approval for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. In addition to our geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. In Q4, we completed enrollment of our EARLY-TAVR pivotal trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic AS patients. Separately, we initiated enrollment in PROGRESS, an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment before they have symptoms or before their AS becomes severe rather than risking irreversible damage to their heart as the disease progresses. We also took steps to advance our innovative product portfolio. In Q4, we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study our next-generation TAVR device, SAPIEN X4. Additionally, in Q4, we received FDA approval to use SAPIEN 3 with our Alterra adaptive pre-stent for congenital heart patients. This should result in a quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that these younger patients will require over their lifetime. In summary, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, we continue to anticipate 2022 underlying TAVR sales growth of 12% to 15%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. Our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges early in 2022, turning to more normalized growth environment as headwinds from Omicron subside and hospital resource constraints stabilize. We remain confident in this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Turning to TMTT. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we completed enrollment of our Class IID pivotal trial, and we remain on track to present data in the second half of 2022. This important milestone keeps us on track for US approval late this year of PASCAL for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. We also continue to expect European approval of our next-generation PASCAL Precision System later this year. At the PCR London Valves conference in Q4, PASCAL 30-day outcomes from our MiCLASP post-market approval study of more than 250 patients in Europe were presented. The data highlighted safe and effective MR reduction in a post-market setting. We also progressed on the enrollment of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease. In mitral replacement, we continue to expand our experience with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. Early experience with these sub-French transfemoral therapies increase our confidence in both platforms. Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies, results from the TRISCEND study were presented at the Annual TCT Conference in November and demonstrated that early patient outcomes with the EVOQUE tricuspid were favorable and sustained at six months. We are encouraged by the procedural success rates and also the significant TR reduction and sustained improvements in quality of life measures experienced by these patients. We continue to make meaningful progress in enrolling our two tricuspid pivotal trials, the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system and the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We anticipate a late 2022 approval of EVOQUE tricuspid in Europe and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients that have very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter revenue of $25 million grew sequentially from the third quarter, as we saw increased adoption of the PASCAL system despite the negative COVID impact in December. Full year 2021 global sales more than doubled to $86 million. As we continue to expand the availability of PASCAL to more centers in Europe, we are pleased with the excellent outcomes for patients supported by our high-touch model. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease in 2022, with the milestones that we outlined in our recent investor conference. Despite the COVID impact so far this year, we continue to expect TMTT sales of $140 million to $170 million for 2022. We estimate the global TMTT opportunity will grow to approximately $5 billion by 2028, and we remain committed to bringing our groundbreaking portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases. We are confident our portfolio strategy positions us well for leadership. In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $889 million, up 15% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2021 global sales of $221 million increased 9% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Although, we saw that hospital staffing shortages continued to worsen throughout the quarter, especially in the US, life-saving surgical therapies continue to be prioritized over elective procedures. We're excited about the continued global adoption of INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA valve. We remain encouraged by the growing evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including 2 studies being presented at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Conference this weekend. The COMMENCE study demonstrates excellent hemodynamics of this tissue technology across all aortic valve sizes at 5 years. While a European economic value study shows a cost reduction with the use of INSPIRIS versus mechanical valves. In summary, we continue to expect that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid single digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by adoption of our premium technologies and procedure growth. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients, extend our global leadership and be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $835 million increased 14% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. 2021 growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales as capital spending resumed. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU also remained in high demand due to the elevated COVID hospitalizations in both the US and Europe. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $212 million increased 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong demand for HemoSphere. Demand for our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors also remained robust in the fourth quarter, including ClearSight, our noninvasive finger cuff, which achieved sustained performance at or above pre-COVID levels. As discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of a full range of technologies creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, and we remain excited about our pipeline of innovative critical care products. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. So in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in 2021, advancing new transformational therapies and delivering strong financial performance. We expect continued growth and progress in 2022. We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well long-term success. As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the number one largest health burden, we believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028. We are confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and the health care system. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So yes, fourth quarter started very nicely. We saw a nice momentum in October and November, and we really saw a very strong impact in December. So, it was primarily focused in the US, and it was centered around really hospital capacity. They really -- they reached their limits in many cases and started deferring procedures. We've seen that continue to lead to a slow start in 2022. So at this point, I would say sales are below what we would have typically expected for a start, probably more in line with the kind of thing that we saw towards the end of December. But having said that, our assumptions are that we're going to see more normalized growth as the hospital resource constraints stabilize. And so as Omicron we think, comes down pretty hard, we think that our full year sales guidance is still in place on our best estimate. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It's -- we don't have great visibility to exactly what backlogs look like or what the patient flow might be. So at this point, we assume that many of the patients that are having procedures postponed or deferred are going to come back. It's not clear to us what month or what quarter we're going to see it. In our assumptions, Robbie, is that by the end of the year, that we would see all the COVID-related delays sort of return to the system. Yes. Thanks for that, Larry. Yes, there \u2013 I think actually it was clearer than you think. Omicron hit the US pretty hard, and it hit it in large population centers. We saw it across the East Coast, we saw it in the Midwest. You know all the places that it was seen. And so we felt a pretty profound impact. In Europe, it was not the case. So although the UK experienced Omicron, most of Continental Europe just didn't see it in Q4. And so it was a very different picture. I think that was the primary reason. Same thing in the rest of the globe, I would argue, right? Yes. Yes. Thanks very much. You know how we deploy these technologies. We're very hands on with them. We use a high-touch model and really try and guide clinicians to do what's right. So, we expect them clearly to be on label. That's the way that we're going to conduct our business. We're going to roll out to people that have experience that we think are very serious about treating mitral disease. And so we think it's going to be one that stays inbounds. Yes, I'll just add to that. I mean, if you want to think about some, just watch the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system and on hospitals in particular. So, if that goes better, then probably has a better chance that our patients flow through faster. And if it's a greater burden have the opposite impact. So, at this point, we still think there's balanced risk in there, but a lot of it is going to depend on whether things transpire the way that we anticipate. Yes. Thanks, Vijay. So, no, clearly, what we felt like we saw OUS was not a result of any kind of stocking. These were real procedures that got done and that holds true Europe, Japan or elsewhere outside the US. Was there more to the question than that, Vijay? Well, yes, I mean it's -- it remains to be seen exactly how this variant is going to affect the rest of the world. There's one argument that say, hey, it's a little delayed and so it will come a little bit later. But then again, it may not have the same impact because of a lot of reasons, whether it's seasonality or vaccination rates or their own safety protocols. So, a little tough to predict how it's going to roll out. But overall, we've modeled probably a little more growth OUS than US for 2022. Yes. Thanks, Joanne. We remember that very well as well. We saw some pretty incredible surge that we really didn't expect in the second quarter. But I'll remind you, 2021 was a different picture than right now. It wasn't Omicron. It was a different variant. Hospitals were probably in a little different position. They weren't dealing with the constraints associated with labor. And I think as you know, there's widespread nursing shortages. We think that all gets worked out over time. We think hospitals have a lot of sophistication. They're going to triage their systems and their staffing measures and ultimately find ways to treat the patients that are most in need. So we think that all gets worked out. But whether it pops in Q2, we're more hesitant than that. We really think it's going to be more of a gradual recovery. Yes. Well, thanks, Matt. And there isn't perfect certainty here, but we get a lot of anecdotal information, and we're obviously very close to our customers. It -- the situation now and as we've gone through it in December and January here, feels very different than the early stages of the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, not only did hospitals sort of shut down and close their doors, but there were patients that were very concerned, that stayed out of the system. And I'll remind you that the patients that Edwards serves are exactly the patients that are most vulnerable to COVID. And so, we sort of had the double whammy, if you will, in 2020. What we feel now is it's less about the patient behavior and more about hospitals' ability to be able to do the cases. So do we hear anecdotal notes and again, I don't have perfect information for you, Matt, but things like hospitals saying, you know what, we're just going to limit to a certain number of procedures per week or we're going to postpone procedures until next month or we're going to involve our Chief Medical Officer, and he's going to look at all the procedures that need to be done and decide in triage them and decide which ones they'll do now and which ones they do later. So you have a variety actions that hospitals are taking. But we think that the patients are there. And so that's why we feel pretty comfortable staying with our current guidance. We don't have perfect visibility, of course, Matt, but that's behind our thinking. Yes. I think the hospitals think about that deeply, Matt, and it is a big plus if they believe that the patients don't need to consume an ICU bed and so forth or even impact hospital occupancy. So, I think it all goes into the math of those folks that are managing hospitals. But even more important for them is they're trying to serve patients properly. They're trying to think about which patients are in greater risk and how to move them through the system. So it's complex and it's highly different from hospital to hospital and region to region, Matt. So it's -- there's a pretty good variance out there, if you will. But in total, I think it's all incorporated in our guidance. Yes. So I think much of this is going to be physicians making that judgment. And so when it's all -- when it actually comes down to it, the physician is going to be looking at this patient, they're going to realize that our PASCAL device is only approved for degenerative and they'll have to look at this particular patient and use their own judgment. We think, by and large, they're going to stay on label, but as you say, there are mixed patients. And so there's going to be some of that, that I'm sure physicians are going to have to just work through. Yes. Thanks very much, Josh. We typically just don't go into some of the particulars associated with the regulatory process. It tends to be complex. There's a lot of nuance to it. And I think it would just be confusing if we went into all that. And so we really -- don't have anything new to share. Yes. Thanks. So, Cecilia, we'll start off by saying, clearly, many of the same sites that we're doing CLASP IID were involved in CLASP IIF and CLASP IITR. And so having completed enrollment in CLASP IID does mean that they probably will turn some of their attention to IIF and IITR. And so I think it's likely to be -- it's only human, it's only likely to be a boost to that. I don't think it's going to have real impact on the completion of the trial. So, -- but we're hopeful that things go well here. Of course, these same groups are working with trying to get through Omicron, which is no picnic, but we're hopeful that's short-lived. As it relates to the SAPIEN X4 or the ALLIANCE trial, remember, this is a new valve. And so this isn't simply a case of, boy, I'm just going to take all my SAPIEN 3 patients and just put this new valve. And it really is a very novel valve system. And so this is going to be one that we do with a great deal of deliberateness. And so it's going to -- there's going to be a learning curve associated with this, and so we're just going to have to work through it. We really don't have a prediction on how fast that will enroll at this time. Yes. We're really looking forward to developing the market in China. And as you say, COVID has been a real setback in that regard because often, if we are launching a new country like that, we would bring a lot of experts from Edwards, key opinion leaders, and there virtually is no travel to China right now. So, it's just been our local team that's doing that, which doesn't make it any easier. We're excited about it. We know this too shall pass and we'll move on to it. And we're really looking forward to bringing truly premium technology to China. Well, I'm sorry, there was a -- let's see. I think that's probably -- does that answer your question, Cecilia? Yes. Okay. Thanks. Thanks Danielle. I mean, first and foremost, when we come to the US, we're going to do -- we're going to run some of the exact same playbook that we have in Europe, which is to really focus on physician training, getting great real-world results, making sure that we get patient -- excellent patient outcomes every time we do this. We're going to probably tend to be staying in the places where people have real experience. I don't know that we have a pricing policy that's been established for the U.S. launch at this point. And so we'll tell you about that once it's clear. But our focus is going to be on doing great cases for a while. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I think you know the way that we've approached this across the board, is we really feel like the TAVR has a long way to go, and a lot of growth in front of it, and deserves a great dedicated team and TMTT opportunity is a very large one. And so the way we've gone at this is decide that we're going to have a dedicated team. Is there some halo that comes from the Edwards brand and so forth, I'd like to think so. Of course, we try and maintain a great reputation, but we don't go into it thinking about leverage so much or it's our bundled sales. That's really not our approach. We're going to sell on really trying to do spectacular procedures and get great outcomes. Yes, we hear you, Suraj. So Suraj, I'm not sure exactly what's going to be presented, but I would expect that you're going to see a pretty fulsome presentation of the data when it finally does get presented. We've said that that's going to happen in the second half of 2022. And when that happens, I think you're going to get a lot of information. You'll see almost everything related to device performance when that's presented. Yes, thanks. So we don't have perfect clarity on what It's going to look like in 2028. But I can tell you basically what's in our assumptions. The great bulk of this is going to be people with symptoms, with severe AS. And I don't know what percentage that is, but it is the overwhelmingly large percentage. We think that there'll be a small portion of it, which will be asymptomatic patients that are severe. We have assumed that moderate AS patients are really not much in that number. It's really negligible. And so, not really in the number at all. And so hopefully, that gives you a sense for it. Yes. Those are all really good questions. And one thing to keep in mind is, the growth rates are all comparable to last year's growth rate, which was less than normal because it was also impacted by the pandemic. So we've been super impressed about what's going on in Europe right now. This mid-teens growth because here's technology that was improved in Europe in 2007 and to be growing at a mid-teens growth rate right now is very encouraging. And it speaks to the strength of TAVR. I mean, Europe has never had -- broadly across Europe, let's put it this way, they've never had -- so for example, TAVR per million population over 65 has been lower in Europe. Pretty good in Germany, but the rest of the country is behind. So there's been some catch-up. When we talk about Japan, we say the same thing, pretty routinely that they really probably should be doing more TAVR and have more disease. And so there's quite a bit of catch-up to go on. So there really is a big opportunity. And part of what we may be seeing is just health care systems that have typically been a little slower to adapt are coming around and fueling the growth that's a little higher. And at the same time, you have to say Omicron did hit US pretty hard. Thanks. Yes. I don't -- the short answer is I'm not prepared to talk about that at this point, Chris. I think there may be some similarities to past trials, but I don't have the specifics on it. So we're going to have to get that to you at a later date here because it's just I don't have that available now. Yes. So thanks. For us, it doesn't feel like it's come really fast. It feels like it's come slower. We think that TAVR should be really popular in Japan, where surgery is not necessarily a preferred therapy and a great interventional procedure should have gone. There are a number of reasons that sort of slowed it down, they had tighter regulations. So for example, they limited TAVR to hybrid ORs. They required approvals by national bodies. But at the same time, there have been some really positive developments in Japan. So now that we have low-risk approval, it's really streamlined the pride and it's reimbursed, that streamlined the process for these patients to receive therapy. And so that was a big one. And slowly, but surely, there have been more centers that were added so that it covers the geography a little better. So, there's some positives there. And we're catching up. We're excited about the growth rate. But in our eyes, it should have happened sooner. Yes. So, it's a good question. Remember, when the pandemic hit and hospitals were in trouble, they really pulled back on capital spending. We saw that even most dramatically in the US. And that continued into early 2021, but it started subsiding, and we saw hospitals started recapitalizing, if you will, and we were the beneficiary of that during 2021 and even saw that affect our performance in the fourth quarter. And we've got this modern HemoSphere technology, which is really a step forward for these patients and brings together a lot of our advanced technology for patients that are needing a great recovery. So, the combination of those have been really helpful. It is. We think it's still a very conducive environment. Some of our people wonder whether 2022 will measure up to 2021 because it felt like 2021 might have had a little catch-up in it. So, that makes them nervous about being too bullish. But we think it's going to be a more normalized year. Yes. So, you're going to test my COVID memory a little bit here. But we felt like we were recovering from Delta. And so it had a pretty significant impact in the third quarter and that was being mitigated, to some extent, it was improving in October and improving in November. And then Omicron showed up and it changed the trend. So, that was that we were -- we went from recovering from Delta to being impacted hard and quick by Omicron. Okay, all. Thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding : Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us with me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2021 financial results. During today's call management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters, and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date of which they are made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information can be found in the press release, our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards ' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the Company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they're referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments, Mike.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks, Mark. Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams who have been highly engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients we serve. Turning to results, third quarter total Company sales of $1.3 billion increased 14% on a constant-currency basis versus the year-ago period. Strong mid-teens growth was driven by our innovative platforms, although lower than our July expectations due to the significant impact COVID had on U.S. hospitals. Although we experienced encouraging signs of patient confidence and continued willingness to seek medical care in July, the Delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last 2 months of the third quarter, especially in the U.S. Despite the pronounced impact of the Delta variant in the U.S. in Q3, we're encouraged by the recent decline in hospital COVID admissions. We believe some procedures were unfortunately deferred in the third quarter. And based on what we saw in Q2, we expect many of these patients who deferred treatment in Q3 will be treated in the future. We continue to expect total Company sales growth to be in the high teens for the full year. In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $508 and $58 million dollars, up 14% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the third quarter. Globally, our average selling price remained stable. In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth was broad-based across both high and low volume centers. As you might expect procedure volumes in Q3 were affected by seasonality and varied by geography and even by hospital, as patients and providers turn their focus again to the pandemic. Our TAVR sales in July benefited from encouraging signs of continued recovery from the pandemic, however procedures were negatively impacted in the last two months of Q3 due to the significant impact Delta had on hospital resources. Outside the U.S. in the third quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by strong international adoption of TAVR, broadly, in all regions. And despite the impact of Delta, the TAVR market in Europe showed relative resilience with strong growth in procedure volumes. Growth was broad-based across Europe and driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. We were pleased with the growth rate considering that in Q3 of 2020 centers in Europe had already recovered from pandemic lows. Longer-term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth, as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. It's worth noting that recently, published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery  definitively recommend TAVR for patients over the age of 75. The acknowledgment by the Surgical society the TAVR is preferred for those over 75 is a significant development. We believe these guidelines represent an important long-term opportunity and although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it remains clear that there is still a large, unmet need for this therapy. Strong TAVR adoption continued in Q3 in Japan. As expected, we received reimbursement approval in Q3 for treatment of patients at low surgical risk. We remained focus on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout this country, driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly under-treated disease amongst this large elderly population. At the upcoming TCT meeting, there's a planned late-breaking update on the economic outcomes of PARTNER 3 at 2 years. In summary, based on October procedure trends, we expect Q4 growth for TAVR to be similar to Q3. We continue to expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% in 2021. We remain as confident as ever, about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients for suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remained untreated. The long-term potential reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a low double-digit compound annual growth rate. Now, turning to TMTT, we've made meaningful progress across all our platforms with over 6000 patients treated to date, to transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity. We remain focused on three key value drivers. A portfolio of different shaded therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. This quarter we progressed on the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are gaining experience with a PASCAL precision platform as part of our class trials, and physician feedback continues to be positive. We look forward to presenting randomized data from the class 2D pivotal trial next year and remain on track for the U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. This important milestone will mark a transition from large single-arm studies through significant pivotal trial results that support approval and adoption and will be the first of several key datasets from our class of trials. We continue to treat patients with both of our mitral -- our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial SAPIEN M3 and MISCEND study of EVOQUE Eos. We are ramping up enrollment with our novel EVOQUE tricuspid replacement therapy as part of the TRISCEND II Pivotal Trial. These processing transfemoral therapies are critical for many patients without treatment options today and exemplify the importance of a comprehensive portfolio. As we continue to expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data at TCT and PCR London Valves next month. Presentations will include six-month outcomes of EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our clinical trial experience in the TRISCEND study. In addition, 30-day outcomes for mitral repair with PASCAL from our Miclast, post-market clinical follow-ups study of over 250 patients. We also anticipate several live case demonstrations of our differentiated therapies. Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, despite the impact of Delta in summer seasonality, global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe. As we expanded commercially, we continue to experience high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes for patients. And we remain committed to employing our high-touch clinical support model. We are pleased with our level of site activation during the quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our previous full-year guidance of $80 million to $100 million and estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025. And we're pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales were $217 million, up 6% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. Despite the Q3 resurgence and COVID cases we were encouraged to see continued SABR procedure growth across most regions. We remain encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the KONECT RESILIA valves conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve. This advanced tissue treatment is increasing supported by growing body of real-world evidence as demonstrated at the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons annual meeting earlier this year. Registry data confirmed excellent real-world outcomes with INSPIRIS RESILIA in patients under the age of 60. As patients increase their awareness of surgical valve choices, we believe that they are learning about the durability potential of RESILIA and engaging with their positions to choose this technology. In summary, we have confidence that our full year 2021 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-teens for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market growth and adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the Surgical Structural Heart market that we serve will grow mid-single-digits through 2026. In Critical Care, third quarter global sales were $213 million up 17% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines led primarily by strong HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S. Our True Wave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to the elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. and demand for products used in high-risk surgery also grew year-over-year in addition to demand for the ClearSight non-invasive finger cup used in elective procedures. In summary, we continue to believe the Critical Care will grow revenue in the low double-digit range in 2021. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem : Thanks Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8th. Total sales in the third quarter grew 14% on an underlying basis over the prior year. As indicated earlier, this strong sales growth is lower than we expected in July before the U.S. Delta surge. Earnings in the quarter of $0.54 met our expectations as COVID -related constrained spending more than offset lower-than-expected sales. As Mike mentioned, based on the improving trends with the Delta variant. And our October procedure trends, we're projecting total Q4 sales of between 1.30 billion and 1.38 billion. A as it relates to each product line, we are forecasting fourth quarter TAVR sales of $850 million to $910 million and still have the potential to reach underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% for the full-year 2021. We're also maintaining our previous ranges for TMTT, Surgical Structural Heart, and Critical Care. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of $2.07 to $2.27 with fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 53 to 59 cents. And now I will cover additional details of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.3% up from 75.5% in the same period last year when we experienced substantial costs responding to COVID, the improvement was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. Like most companies, we are seeing signs of inflation, generally, in things like some of the raw materials we use in production, as well as shipping and logistics. With that said, some of the extraordinary costs we incurred when COVID hit last year have lessened. And the net result is no material impact to our gross profit margin performance or guidance for 2021. More broadly, we're continuing our investments to ensure that our supply chain is strong and resilient and capable of delivering life-saving products for our patients. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $364 million or 27.8% of sales compared to $307 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs and increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year. We are planning a sequential ramp up of expenses in the fourth quarter as COVID related restrictions continued to subside. We still expect full-year 2021 SGNA expenses as a percentage of sales excluding special items to be 28% to 29%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 22% over the prior year to $238 million or 18.2% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. We are planning to increase these expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full-year 2021, we continue to expect R&D expenses as a percentage of sales to be 17% to 18%. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 320-basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full-year rate in 2021, excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of four percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points for $8 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $70 million positive impact, or about 1.5%, to full-year 2021 sales, compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. And relative to our July guidance, FX rates positively impacted our third quarter earnings per share by less than a penny. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $471 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $532 million less capital spending of $61 million our year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion. The strong cash flows are a reflection of our exceptional portfolio of patient-focused technologies that are generating returns from previous investments, which allows us to fund future internal and external opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible Balance Sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and investments as of September 30th. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were 632 million and we continue to expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll make a quick comment about our outlook for 2022. It's premature to offer detailed guidance today, but we will provide 2022 financial guidance at our Investor Conference on December 8th. In general, in 2022, we're planning on less disruption from COVID, as we assume the resumption of more normalized sales and earnings growth, we will provide guidance for gross profit and operating margins, as well as more visibility into any potential impact from changes in corporate tax rates. And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks Scott. We're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance despite the headwinds associated with the pandemic. And as patients and clinicians increasingly choose transcatheter valve therapy, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity. We are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy, because we believe there is a broad group of patients still suffering from Structural Heart disease and the pandemic's impact will wane. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding : Hey, thanks a lot, Mike. And as you heard from Scott earlier, our 2021 Investor Conference will take place on Wednesday, December 8th, here at our headquarters in Irvine, California. For those of you able to join us on campus, the conference will be hosted with appropriate safety precautions, and there will also be available via webcast. Either way, we really hope you can be a part of it. In addition to our 2022 financial guidance, you'll hear more about Edwards focused innovation strategy and our comprehensive and exciting product pipeline. For more information, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Edwards website at ir.edwards.com. So, with that, we're ready to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit the number of questions to 1, plus 1 follow-up, to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue, and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for the first one, Mike or Scott, perhaps the Q4 guidance here. What are the underlying assumptions here in terms of any further disruptions from future base or perhaps even the flu season where it might be perhaps hard to differentiate respiratory symptoms between a traditional flu versus the COVID? So, some commentary on Q4 assumptions will be helpful.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Vijay like so many others, we really struggle with precisely for projecting the pandemic. Edwards\u2019s business is strong all the fundamentals are in a great place, and we know that there are many patients with structural heart disease in particular that are in need. We feel great about it from that perspective, but the pandemic ends up having impact on hospitals and their ability to be able to handle the volumes and we find it very spotty. It's regional in nature and the good news is we're watching the Delta variant come down in the U.S. and that's where we felt most of the impact and that's very good. Of course, there is concerned of will there be some kind of a winter surge that is not apparent at this point. So those things are always possible. We have by and large modelled the fact that, we think things are going to get gradually better. We have taken into account where we are in October. And in October, we saw run rates that were similar to what we saw in the last couple of months of Q3. And so that has also gone into our thinking. So, I don't know if that answers your question, Vijay?\nVijay Kumar : No. That's helpful, Mike. And just on the last comments around hospital capacity to handling volumes, I guess labor shortage has been spoken about on the one hand, when I think about the limited number of  centers and the issue of labor shortages, it feels like hanging backlog or excess cases might be a challenge for them. On the flip side, Mike, conscious sedation, where patients are in and out pretty quickly, these are highly profitable procedures, so should we, perhaps, be making case for hospitals to incentivize, perhaps drug volumes. I'm curious how you balance this too.\nMike Mussallem : Yes. No, it's a great point, Vijay, and it is one of the pluses that's associated with TAVR that, often there isn't an ICU stay. But when we watch what happens with various hospitals and sometimes whether it's for staffing reasons or just the fact that they're swamped with COVID patients, they will just put up the stop sign and decide that they're just not going to do procedures and whether they are elective or resource consuming or not. We're probably more impacted by the ICU capability. But it's not always the case. Sometimes it's just broadly across the hospital so I don't have one answer for all because it tends to be a little bit more snowflakes with this hospital being a bit different, but hopefully it provides you with a little bit of color.\nVijay Kumar : Understood, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America, please state your question.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thanks, and good afternoon. Mike, I realize it's a challenging time to make forecasts. And I won't ask you about forecast. What I'm curious about and would love your views on, is just what we know now, what are you seeing out there now? How much better in the environment than it was a month ago. Just curious to see your net views on, and I'm asking specifically from a TAVR perspective. How much improvement you are seeing, where are we right now relative to where we were just a few months ago. Thank you.\nMike Mussallem : Yeah, thanks, Bob. It's a really good question. You're probably stay close to our team that watch daily sales each day and adjust their own feelings based on how things change almost on a daily basis. And things, it gets tough. And I hate to get too granular, but the things are a little better today than they were even earlier in the month. But I hate to get too granular on that, Bob. In general, we tried to give you some information. I let you know that October was not so dissimilar than the end of Q3. So, it's not -- we didn't want to send a signal that all of a sudden October is back to the kind of thing that we were experiencing in Q2. So, we're not experiencing that kind of an environment yet, but we're overall optimistic. I mean, we talked to a lot of folks, anecdotally, obviously these -- the trends that I mentioned of Delta, improving is something we think is going to pay off, we think. Often that -- maybe TAVR is a bit of a trailing indicator of what's happening with COVID, that the cases ultimately turn into ICU stays, and it probably affects our caseload a little bit later, but that's a bit speculative on our part.\nScott Ullem : Bob I'll just check on something that Mike said. Which is if you just roll forward, what things have been trending like in October, the growth rate for Q4 and TAVR looks a lot like it did for Q3, which is, call it 14%. So, like Mike said, it's moving around, we're watching it carefully and try not to overreact are under react to what the daily sales trends looks like. But if you had to call it right now, that's sort of what the trend looks like. And then for the full year, it gets you to something nearer the 20% underlying growth rate that we've talked about for all of 2021.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you, Scott. That's very helpful. And then last quick question is, just on the U.S. trial for PASCAL and when we'll see those data, is there a set time for that yet or just sometime early in 2022?\nMike Mussallem : We don't have clarity on when the timing for that will be we say it'll be next year. We're sticking with our date and our belief that we will have approval by the end of next year. But we really don't have clarity on when it's going to be presented. That'll be one that we'll hopefully, we'll have a little bit more visibility when we get to the investor conference, Bob. I'm trying to give you a sense for it at that time.\nBob Hopkins: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me, earlier this year, we saw some competitive data that maybe looks a little more competitive with SAPIEN 3. I know it's still early days and the European numbers look good this quarter, but are you starting to see any shift in trends or reception to some of the newer Valves in Europe recently?\nMike Mussallem : The short answer is no, it's been very similar feeling that we've had throughout the year that was the case in the past. We continue to think that the top two competitors make up about 85% of the sales in Europe, and all the rest, which is a full complement of competitors, make up the other 15%. We really haven't seen any significant shifts in that, if that's helpful.\nRobert Marcus : Yes, it is. And maybe one for Scott. This is another quarter where we saw the financial leverage potential of the business. Where do you think -- you talked about spending more in fourth quarter, but where do you think we are maybe from a gross margin and operating expense. Perspective versus a no COVID environment. So maybe said another way, if you fast forward and there's no more COVID, does this gross margin have room to improve from here? And maybe how much impaired is the SGNA and RND versus what you would like to spend in unrestrained environment.\nScott Ullem : We do think gross margin has room to improve from, as does operating margin, keep in mind we're already starting from relatively strong margins compared to our industry. So, our priority has been investing aggressively on internal growth more so than on trying to expand margins. But I do think there's going to be opportunity for those margins to gradually, incrementally, slowly expand over time. And it's something that we try to think carefully about. Short-term though, to your question about COVID, it's been remarkable, our margins have remained pretty stable despite the fact that sales are down relative to pre - Covid levels. Because expenses are down as well, largely driven by things that are happening out in the field. So, travel, meetings, attendance at various different societies and events. And so, it's been kind of a natural hedge against the sales headwinds that we've seen from COVID. and we're benefiting from that. To be honest though, we'd like to see expenses go back up along with sales because it's an indication that the environment is more normalized, that we're able to invest aggressively that we can enroll our clinical trials at the higher rates that we saw pre-COVID. And so that's the way we're thinking about margins overall.\nRobert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen, please go ahead with your question.\nJosh Jennings : Hi. Good evening. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to start Mike; I was hoping to just learn a little bit about your updated thoughts on the backlog that you mentioned in the second quarter earnings call. Assume with just the environment that that's peeled back a little bit. But one, just any kind of review of the referral channels and patients coming off the sideline in 3Q. And should investors be thinking that that 2Q phenomenon could reemerge in 2022 as we move through this COVID surge.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks Josh, you're on a key point, and we do talk about it quite a bit inside. We don't have perfect visibility and perfect data. So much of what we rely on our anecdotal reports when we spent a lot of time with our customers and front-line clinical specialists to try and gain some kind of perspective. It's tough for us to nail the timing and magnitude of this, but clearly, we feel like we got a small lift in Q2 from patients that came into the system that had probably deferred care. If we reflect back on the total pandemic when things first stopped back in 2020, back in the March/April timeframe, it's difficult for us to say that we saw those patients come back into the system. But differently, it felt like the -- last winter's patients did, indeed  some of those. some small quantity showed up and supplemented Q2. It's not a giant number but its additive, and we speculate the similar kind of thing might happen as a result of the patients that have deferred care during the Delta variant. During the Delta variant we're speculating again, we may indeed have had these patients that actually saw their physicians and got diagnosed but that the actual treaters in regional hotspots weren't there to provide the therapy. So, we think there is some reason why this might come back exactly when it might come back is very difficult but as COVID wanes, were hoping that indeed, we see a similar phenomenon as we saw in Q2.\nJosh Jennings : Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up and we get a lot of questions just on low-risk penetration. I think the TVT registry update was presented a couple of weeks ago. And I think for 2020, the update was at 28% of patients received TAVR were low-risk. That seems pretty low. It seems like we're still in early innings of low-risk penetration, but just would love to get your thoughts in terms of where the TAVR market is, in terms of penetrating that low-risk opportunity. Thanks a lot.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks, Josh. I wish I could tell you the problem was low risk. We think there's an under-treatment problem across all the risk spectrums, whether it's high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for surgery. We're still -- I think early innings is a good way to characterize it. We still think that there are many patients that should be receiving therapy that don't. It's for a variety of reasons and in many cases, they are just not aware of the option of TAVR being available for them and being an appropriate for them. And so, it's a key initiative for us, we've been progress, but the progress has been slow and steady and we're not close. I don't know if I would put tremendous stock in that penetration number. In general, we think penetration rates across the border are even worse than that.\nJosh Jennings : Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic : Hi thanks so much for taking the question. Just one on Europe and overseas TAVR and then one follow-up if I could, just on general market trends. The European or overseas numbers came to be less sequentially impacted than the U.S. And then there's been an awful lot of focus on staffing and challenges around U.S. Obviously the surge, but do you see -- I'm curious if you see staffing in other regions being as much of an issue as it is in the U.S. and whether you can tease out the areas of strengths that drove what was pretty good Q3 performance outside the U.S. despite the surge and everything that went on. Then I have just one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. No, your observation was correct. We saw a far more impact in the U.S. than we saw in Europe. Our colleagues in Europe, by comparison, were pretty healthy growth rates. And you'll notice in my comment that if you go back to Q3 of last year, it's not as though Europe was really doing poorly. They actually had a growth quarter versus 2019. I think all I want to say high-single-digit growth or something last year. So, this is growth on top of that growth, which is pretty significant considering this therapy was introduced in Europe back in '07, it's pretty mature. And here we are still growing even during a pandemic. They, for whatever reason, have the Delta variant didn't seem to impact the European centers the same way it did in the U.S.\nMatt Miksic : That's great. And then if I could, I know Scott, you had laid out some basics or bullet points of what we can expect at the Analyst Meeting and Investor Meeting in December. But in past years, there's one thing that seems to have come up year-over-year, which is great growth in say, a given year for TAVR, and then the issue of comps becomes a conversation for the following year. And, I guess, one of the things heading into '22, I think you mentioned decreasing impact of COVID or something like that, and back to normalized growth. I'd just be curious to hear whether you expect comps to be potentially a little bit less of the conversation. When you frame out your expectations to start '22 given the way this year has played out?\nScott Ullem : Well, I guess by definition, the comps are important just as we think about growth rates, but it sort of ties back to Vijay's question earlier on about when do we start seeing COVID more in the rearview mirror and less in the windshield, and to the extent that that lessens as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, beginning the first quarter, for example, then prospects for 2022 growth are going to be higher. If COVID is playing a more meaningful role in certain regions or hotpots that are more noticeable then, that's going to impact our growth overall. That's probably the biggest uncertainty that we have going into 2022, because overall, we feel really positive about the growth prospects for TAVR in the U.S. and Europe and Japan and in the rest of the world. One of the things that we're talking about earlier with this low-risk penetration while it's difficult to calculate the actual penetration. Remember the timing on low risk, where we have the data for low-risk, we're PARTNER 3 at ACC in 2019, we got approval in the third quarter of 2019 and shortly thereafter, COVID became a factor. It interrupted our growth for TAVR. And so, we haven't really had this period that's uninterrupted from COVID for any extent of time since we got the low-risk approval and it's one of the reasons why we think they're just great growth opportunities longer-term for TAVR.\nMatt Miksic : That's helpful color. Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SDD Leerink. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question on Pascale shifting to nitrile now. I was just wondering Mike, if you could talk a little bit about the U.S. launch strategy. I know it's early, but you guys launched at premium price in Europe. Curious about whether that's the plan for the U.S. if you can disclose that. and if it is, what we need to see from the data set that's going to be presented next year.\nMike Mussallem : Yes. Thanks. Yes. No. As we indicated, we're looking forward to having PASCAL approved and again it would be approved for DMR by the end of '22 in our views. We're already taking some of the initial steps to build some capabilities and will assemble a dedicated field team and we will be implementing our high-touch model. And they are really -- we're going to focus on just getting excellent real-world outcomes. We're going to take advantage of all the learnings that we've had from launching TAVR around the globe and launching TMTT in Europe. In general, we do consider PASCAL a premium therapy and would also implement our premium pricing plan that would be consistent with what we've done elsewhere in the world. Hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we would approach this.\nDanielle Antalffy : That's very helpful. And then the follow-up question I have is, as far as target centers initially, I mean, is the plan to target existing TAVR centers to leverage your TAVR superior market share, or will you go specifically to Micro Center? How do we think about the initial target centers? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks Danielle. It's a little early to say, this is going to be an interesting evolution. In some cases, the same people that do TAVR will might do mitral cases and other there's dedicated teams. It's a little too early for us to say we're going to get into it. We'll have more to talk about when we're together at the investor conference. But right now, I really don't have any specific color for you.\nDanielle Antalffy : Understood.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nCecilia Furlong : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask, Mike, about Japan, and what you've seen just throughout this year in terms of the centers over there that are certified to perform TAVR, how that's trended? And then as you think about low-risk reimbursement, the outlook given the landscape of TAVR centers, kind of near-term and then flowing into 2022 as well.\nMike Mussallem: Yeah. Thanks. So, we were very pleased to get the low-risk reimbursement approval. That happen ed mid-quarter, I want to say, sometime in the August. There are indeed new centers that get added. Those get added on a pretty deliberate basis. And those new centers tend to be slow to ramp up. There are significant regulatory requirements that are necessary to fire up new centers. But having said that, it's a dramatically under-treated disease in Japan. They have a very large elderly population. And when we think about it in terms of, for example, TAVR per million, we say, \"Boy, there's still a long way to go. \" So, we're very pleased at the growth rate, the growth rate in Japan was even higher than our international growth. And the reimbursement is important. It's an important key. It's exciting to be able to get that and hopefully that begins helping Japanese clinicians redefine the importance of TAVR for their patients and I think we've got to take it for granted that low-risk was -- is already present in other places around the world but it just has been in Japan until this last quarter.\nCecilia Furlong : Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask as well, just what you're seeing on the clinical enrollment landscape given COVID and if you could provide any updates either on early TAVR or X4, and when you expect to ramp in enrollments, there. Thank you.\nMike Mussallem : Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. You might recall Cecilia, that early on we said that there was impact on our trial enrollments. We're not experiencing that the same way during this flare up of Delta. It doesn't make it easier, but hospitals have done a nice job of adjusting and adapt. They have very committed teams. And so, whether it's our trials in TAVR, our trials in TMTT, it feels like we've done well. We basically feel that our trials' timing has not been impacted by this latest surge.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nLarry Biegelsen : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me on PASCAL, Mike in Europe. It looks like your share has kind of been inching up and by our math, you've reached about 20% share in Europe after about 3 years. So, my question is, what gets you higher? I know that your goal is to be a market leader. So, do you need the rent -- the RCT data, and how are physicians using PASCAL in Europe? Are they mostly using it for DMR or are they using it for both DMR and FMR, I believe the label is broad? What gets your share? What do you think you need to get that share up? Thanks for taking it.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks Larry and as you might imagine, it's difficult to estimate shares, but frankly, we haven't really gone into this thinking that that's our focus. Our focus has been to get outstanding clinical results. And we focus on that both within our trials and within our commercial experience, and that's where we've pushed our team. And when you ask me what's it going to take to get your share up, it's going to be impressive clinical results. That will show up 2 ways, one in the day-to-day experiences of clinicians and patients and the other is when they actually get a chance to see some of our results. And you see more and more data that is going to become available over time as you see clinical information. So even at the upcoming TV -- or TCT, I think you'll see more information on some of our early clinical experience. At this point, we're not even in every country in Europe but our focus just to underline the point again is not on share. This is a really big opportunity. There are so many patients with mitral regurgitation and there's many that are just not indicated not being well-served today. That's where our focus is.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Meter with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nAdam Meter: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one from the U.S. TAVR market and competition specifically. There's a new TAVR competitor that recently entered the market. I know it's early here, but have you seen any impact in the marketplace and can you comment on how that new competitor is approaching the market, anything from a pricing standpoint? And then maybe just more broadly, how do you see the potential impact of this third player going forward? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks, Adam. Yeah, when we talked about our results, whether it was our global results or our U.S. results, what we said it was broad-based, but the procedure volume, growth, and the Edwards growth were comparable. We really didn't see anything that was noteworthy here in terms of talking about share. So, we've mentioned before that we have a full complement of competitors in Europe. And so that may be some kind of a leading indicator, but we just haven't seen anything in the data in the U.S.\nAdam Meter: Okay. Understood. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Petrone : Thanks. 1 quick follow-up for Scott. It's just on expectations on the Analyst Day. I just want to make sure. Is the Company issuing top-line guidance or is it just PNL guidance? And then a question on low-risk, we are seeing DTC advertising in all the areas of med-tech, albeit it's more in Consumer Health facing markets. But does DTC in low-risk makes sense here to open up that opportunity as we move in to a period of higher vaccination and eventually antivirals. Thanks.\nScott Ullem : Yes, thanks, Anthony, relating to the investor conference, we're expecting to provide guidance for the top line and the rest of the income statements. Typically, we talk about sales dollar ranges and underlying growth rates based upon our forecast for how the year is going to end up when we get to December. And we'll also talk about margins, gross margin, operating margins, and whatever other financial metrics we've got clarity enough on to guide to. As it relates to DTC, I'll start and then Mike can offer perspective as well. We think that market activation and inspiring more patients to come into, get treated is a really important part of the future and the long-term growth of TAVR, and so, we are already investing some resources around getting directly to patients, to primary care physicians, to referring physicians, and we'll be doing more of that in the future. It's not aimed specifically at a patient in a particular risk category. We're trying to get to all patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and we expect that's going to be an important driver of growth.\nMike Mussallem : Yeah. I'll just pile on there, Anthony. Thanks, it's a good question. If you go back, historically, in the early days of TAVR, we really counted on the physicians that did TAVR to educate their referring base d. And that's the way that we counted on the word getting out and I don't know we were under the impression that that actually would be sufficient. But we've learned over the years that that's dramatically insufficient. And so, as Scott said, we've gone on a number of roads here to make sure that the referral base is, indeed, educated. We've made some good progress there, although, we're far from satisfied in terms of where we are right now. But to be really specific, going all the way upstream to consumer, we do believe that that could be a valuable lever. We're specifically doing some experimenting in that regard and maybe have some more specific things to share with you when you come to the Investor Conference.\nAnthony Petrone : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Could we spend a minute on Critical Care? The last couple of quarters have been particularly strong. Is it possible to tease out how much of that strength is just underlying? In other words, it will continue into 2022 and '23 or it's just sort of, I want to call it one-time in nature associated with the pandemic.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks. So, it's a good question, Joanne. I mean, if you were to ask our teams here, you're going to keep growing at 17%. I think they'd say, no, that's not realistic. That we got some help this quarter by some large U.S. capital orders that really helped out. And that made a difference. Now, overall, are we pleased with what's going on in Critical Care? Is there more innovation than ever? Are they sustaining a pretty healthy growth rate that are better than I think med-tech averages? I think all of those are true, and we're very proud of that, or we're going to continue hitting it hard in that regard. But in terms of being able to maintain these kind of growth rates that we did in this quarter. That's not likely.\nJoanne Wuensch : As a follow-up question, use of cash. Can you remind us of your thinking on that topic? And thank you.\nScott Ullem : Sure, I'll tackle that one, Joanne. Thanks for the question on use of cash. Really, our priorities have not changed. Our first priority is to fund prospects for long-term organic growth that are generated internally and we want to make sure that we're fully funding those platforms. We supplement that with external investments, so we'll buy small sized early-stage companies, usually pre -revenue. Sometimes we invest in options to acquire companies based upon certain milestones or targets being met. And so, beyond growth internally and externally than we looked at the balance sheet. And we've been a consistent repurchase of shares as you know, we're going to continue to do that opportunistically. And we think that's going to be an important way that we can give capital back to shareholders over time.\nJoanne Wuensch : Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nPito Chickering : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I follow-up on Josh 's low-risk penetration question. Like, if you look specifically at a low-risk patients, where do you see in those patients in the third quarter versus the second quarter? And what do you assume those patients in the fourth quarter? Just curious how much that finalized impacted in the back half of the year due to COVID.\nMike Mussallem : Yeah, thanks Pito. We've said this before, so I apologize for taking you through it again. But remember there is character -- this characterization of patients by high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, was a characterization done by FDA as a regulatory pathway for TAVR to help make sure that the oldest sickest patients were treated first at the highest risk to try and minimize the risks associated with the new therapy. If you were to -- when you actually look at any patient, their key concern is not whether there are risks surviving surgery. It's -- what is the risk for survival? What is it liking the live with TAVR versus live with aortic stenosis? And that's the real question. We spend less time, and frankly clinicians and patients, spend less time talking about whether they are low-risk or intermediate. We really don't differentiate in that regard. Having said that, what do we think -- how did patients behave in the third quarter? We -- as I tried to infer before, we don't have perfect visibility there, but we think they were indeed seeing another doctor, they were indeed getting diagnosed, they were indeed getting screened. But there were a number of cases where the treating hospitals themselves just stopped taking patients, and that was the primary impact in the quarter.\nPito Chickering : Fair enough and then Scott, a final question for you. You aren't changing the TMTT guidance, that's a pretty wide range. Just curious what would have to occur at the high end versus low end of the range. Thanks so much.\nScott Ullem : That's a good question. And like TAVR and other businesses, a lot of this is going to depend upon how much of a factor the Delta variant plays in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of different elements to our TMTT businesses right now. One is our commercial position in Europe, where we're selling PASCAL primarily. And then the other is clinical trial enrollment where there is reimbursement in the U.S. What we're looking for is for there to be a normalization of patient flow in both Europe and the U.S. And that's really going to be an important determinant for where things go in the fourth quarter, we're expecting sequential growth in Q4, and that will contribute to where we end up in that range of 80 to a $100 million in expected full year sales.\nPito Chickering : Thanks so much\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Pito. I think we have time for one more question, maybe.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Pasquale : Thanks for squeezing me in. 1 -- quick 1 on TMTT and then 1 on TAVR. Mike, in your script, you said you made progress enrolling the five TMTT pivotal trials in the quarter. I think that group of 5 includes class 2D. To just clarify, has class 2D actually finish enrolling? Any details there would be great.\nMike Mussallem : We really haven't gotten specific on that. We really don't have specific comments. But as you might imagine, we're committed to -- when we say that we believe that we're going to have 2D approved by late 2002, that naturally infers that we're close to having our enrollment completed, and that will allow us to prepare for the PMA and go through that process. So, a lot of that has to happen. We'll get into a little more granularity when we're together at the investor conference.\nChris Pasquale : Okay. Then there's a late breaker at AHA that's looking at asymptomatic AS patients. It's not your trial, so I understand it's -- you\u2019re not in the weave there. But curious if you know anything about it and to what extent that data could be instructive as we think about what we might see in the future from early TAVR.\nMike Mussallem : Yes, it's a good question. I don't have personal knowledge of that trial, and so I can't really comment about it. The AHA are a strong organization and good partners and I think they really care about patients with AS. But I am not sure precisely what trial that you're referring to both -- you know how we feel about asymptomatic patients. We feel like these are patients that should be treated. The decide via of differing treatment and waiting for symptoms as an outdated thought process. And we're very committed to change that through rigorous clinical trials.\nChris Pasquale : Thanks, Mike.\nMike Mussallem : Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mike, and I will welcome any additional questions by telephone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good evening.",

            "content": "Thanks Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8th. Total sales in the third quarter grew 14% on an underlying basis over the prior year. As indicated earlier, this strong sales growth is lower than we expected in July before the U.S. Delta surge. Earnings in the quarter of $0.54 met our expectations as COVID -related constrained spending more than offset lower-than-expected sales. As Mike mentioned, based on the improving trends with the Delta variant. And our October procedure trends, we're projecting total Q4 sales of between 1.30 billion and 1.38 billion. A as it relates to each product line, we are forecasting fourth quarter TAVR sales of $850 million to $910 million and still have the potential to reach underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% for the full-year 2021. We're also maintaining our previous ranges for TMTT, Surgical Structural Heart, and Critical Care. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of $2.07 to $2.27 with fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 53 to 59 cents. And now I will cover additional details of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.3% up from 75.5% in the same period last year when we experienced substantial costs responding to COVID, the improvement was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. Like most companies, we are seeing signs of inflation, generally, in things like some of the raw materials we use in production, as well as shipping and logistics. With that said, some of the extraordinary costs we incurred when COVID hit last year have lessened. And the net result is no material impact to our gross profit margin performance or guidance for 2021. More broadly, we're continuing our investments to ensure that our supply chain is strong and resilient and capable of delivering life-saving products for our patients. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $364 million or 27.8% of sales compared to $307 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs and increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year. We are planning a sequential ramp up of expenses in the fourth quarter as COVID related restrictions continued to subside. We still expect full-year 2021 SGNA expenses as a percentage of sales excluding special items to be 28% to 29%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 22% over the prior year to $238 million or 18.2% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. We are planning to increase these expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full-year 2021, we continue to expect R&D expenses as a percentage of sales to be 17% to 18%. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 320-basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full-year rate in 2021, excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of four percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points for $8 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $70 million positive impact, or about 1.5%, to full-year 2021 sales, compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. And relative to our July guidance, FX rates positively impacted our third quarter earnings per share by less than a penny. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $471 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $532 million less capital spending of $61 million our year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion. The strong cash flows are a reflection of our exceptional portfolio of patient-focused technologies that are generating returns from previous investments, which allows us to fund future internal and external opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible Balance Sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and investments as of September 30th. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were 632 million and we continue to expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll make a quick comment about our outlook for 2022. It's premature to offer detailed guidance today, but we will provide 2022 financial guidance at our Investor Conference on December 8th. In general, in 2022, we're planning on less disruption from COVID, as we assume the resumption of more normalized sales and earnings growth, we will provide guidance for gross profit and operating margins, as well as more visibility into any potential impact from changes in corporate tax rates. And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike. Bob I'll just check on something that Mike said. Which is if you just roll forward, what things have been trending like in October, the growth rate for Q4 and TAVR looks a lot like it did for Q3, which is, call it 14%. So, like Mike said, it's moving around, we're watching it carefully and try not to overreact are under react to what the daily sales trends looks like. But if you had to call it right now, that's sort of what the trend looks like. And then for the full year, it gets you to something nearer the 20% underlying growth rate that we've talked about for all of 2021. We do think gross margin has room to improve from, as does operating margin, keep in mind we're already starting from relatively strong margins compared to our industry. So, our priority has been investing aggressively on internal growth more so than on trying to expand margins. But I do think there's going to be opportunity for those margins to gradually, incrementally, slowly expand over time. And it's something that we try to think carefully about. Short-term though, to your question about COVID, it's been remarkable, our margins have remained pretty stable despite the fact that sales are down relative to pre - Covid levels. Because expenses are down as well, largely driven by things that are happening out in the field. So, travel, meetings, attendance at various different societies and events. And so, it's been kind of a natural hedge against the sales headwinds that we've seen from COVID. and we're benefiting from that. To be honest though, we'd like to see expenses go back up along with sales because it's an indication that the environment is more normalized, that we're able to invest aggressively that we can enroll our clinical trials at the higher rates that we saw pre-COVID. And so that's the way we're thinking about margins overall. Well, I guess by definition, the comps are important just as we think about growth rates, but it sort of ties back to Vijay's question earlier on about when do we start seeing COVID more in the rearview mirror and less in the windshield, and to the extent that that lessens as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, beginning the first quarter, for example, then prospects for 2022 growth are going to be higher. If COVID is playing a more meaningful role in certain regions or hotpots that are more noticeable then, that's going to impact our growth overall. That's probably the biggest uncertainty that we have going into 2022, because overall, we feel really positive about the growth prospects for TAVR in the U.S. and Europe and Japan and in the rest of the world. One of the things that we're talking about earlier with this low-risk penetration while it's difficult to calculate the actual penetration. Remember the timing on low risk, where we have the data for low-risk, we're PARTNER 3 at ACC in 2019, we got approval in the third quarter of 2019 and shortly thereafter, COVID became a factor. It interrupted our growth for TAVR. And so, we haven't really had this period that's uninterrupted from COVID for any extent of time since we got the low-risk approval and it's one of the reasons why we think they're just great growth opportunities longer-term for TAVR. Yes, thanks, Anthony, relating to the investor conference, we're expecting to provide guidance for the top line and the rest of the income statements. Typically, we talk about sales dollar ranges and underlying growth rates based upon our forecast for how the year is going to end up when we get to December. And we'll also talk about margins, gross margin, operating margins, and whatever other financial metrics we've got clarity enough on to guide to. As it relates to DTC, I'll start and then Mike can offer perspective as well. We think that market activation and inspiring more patients to come into, get treated is a really important part of the future and the long-term growth of TAVR, and so, we are already investing some resources around getting directly to patients, to primary care physicians, to referring physicians, and we'll be doing more of that in the future. It's not aimed specifically at a patient in a particular risk category. We're trying to get to all patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and we expect that's going to be an important driver of growth. Sure, I'll tackle that one, Joanne. Thanks for the question on use of cash. Really, our priorities have not changed. Our first priority is to fund prospects for long-term organic growth that are generated internally and we want to make sure that we're fully funding those platforms. We supplement that with external investments, so we'll buy small sized early-stage companies, usually pre -revenue. Sometimes we invest in options to acquire companies based upon certain milestones or targets being met. And so, beyond growth internally and externally than we looked at the balance sheet. And we've been a consistent repurchase of shares as you know, we're going to continue to do that opportunistically. And we think that's going to be an important way that we can give capital back to shareholders over time. That's a good question. And like TAVR and other businesses, a lot of this is going to depend upon how much of a factor the Delta variant plays in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of different elements to our TMTT businesses right now. One is our commercial position in Europe, where we're selling PASCAL primarily. And then the other is clinical trial enrollment where there is reimbursement in the U.S. What we're looking for is for there to be a normalization of patient flow in both Europe and the U.S. And that's really going to be an important determinant for where things go in the fourth quarter, we're expecting sequential growth in Q4, and that will contribute to where we end up in that range of 80 to a $100 million in expected full year sales."

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams who have been highly engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients we serve. Turning to results, third quarter total Company sales of $1.3 billion increased 14% on a constant-currency basis versus the year-ago period. Strong mid-teens growth was driven by our innovative platforms, although lower than our July expectations due to the significant impact COVID had on U.S. hospitals. Although we experienced encouraging signs of patient confidence and continued willingness to seek medical care in July, the Delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last 2 months of the third quarter, especially in the U.S. Despite the pronounced impact of the Delta variant in the U.S. in Q3, we're encouraged by the recent decline in hospital COVID admissions. We believe some procedures were unfortunately deferred in the third quarter. And based on what we saw in Q2, we expect many of these patients who deferred treatment in Q3 will be treated in the future. We continue to expect total Company sales growth to be in the high teens for the full year. In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $508 and $58 million dollars, up 14% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the third quarter. Globally, our average selling price remained stable. In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth was broad-based across both high and low volume centers. As you might expect procedure volumes in Q3 were affected by seasonality and varied by geography and even by hospital, as patients and providers turn their focus again to the pandemic. Our TAVR sales in July benefited from encouraging signs of continued recovery from the pandemic, however procedures were negatively impacted in the last two months of Q3 due to the significant impact Delta had on hospital resources. Outside the U.S. in the third quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by strong international adoption of TAVR, broadly, in all regions. And despite the impact of Delta, the TAVR market in Europe showed relative resilience with strong growth in procedure volumes. Growth was broad-based across Europe and driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. We were pleased with the growth rate considering that in Q3 of 2020 centers in Europe had already recovered from pandemic lows. Longer-term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth, as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. It's worth noting that recently, published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery  definitively recommend TAVR for patients over the age of 75. The acknowledgment by the Surgical society the TAVR is preferred for those over 75 is a significant development. We believe these guidelines represent an important long-term opportunity and although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it remains clear that there is still a large, unmet need for this therapy. Strong TAVR adoption continued in Q3 in Japan. As expected, we received reimbursement approval in Q3 for treatment of patients at low surgical risk. We remained focus on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout this country, driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly under-treated disease amongst this large elderly population. At the upcoming TCT meeting, there's a planned late-breaking update on the economic outcomes of PARTNER 3 at 2 years. In summary, based on October procedure trends, we expect Q4 growth for TAVR to be similar to Q3. We continue to expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% in 2021. We remain as confident as ever, about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients for suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remained untreated. The long-term potential reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a low double-digit compound annual growth rate. Now, turning to TMTT, we've made meaningful progress across all our platforms with over 6000 patients treated to date, to transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity. We remain focused on three key value drivers. A portfolio of different shaded therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. This quarter we progressed on the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are gaining experience with a PASCAL precision platform as part of our class trials, and physician feedback continues to be positive. We look forward to presenting randomized data from the class 2D pivotal trial next year and remain on track for the U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. This important milestone will mark a transition from large single-arm studies through significant pivotal trial results that support approval and adoption and will be the first of several key datasets from our class of trials. We continue to treat patients with both of our mitral -- our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial SAPIEN M3 and MISCEND study of EVOQUE Eos. We are ramping up enrollment with our novel EVOQUE tricuspid replacement therapy as part of the TRISCEND II Pivotal Trial. These processing transfemoral therapies are critical for many patients without treatment options today and exemplify the importance of a comprehensive portfolio. As we continue to expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data at TCT and PCR London Valves next month. Presentations will include six-month outcomes of EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our clinical trial experience in the TRISCEND study. In addition, 30-day outcomes for mitral repair with PASCAL from our Miclast, post-market clinical follow-ups study of over 250 patients. We also anticipate several live case demonstrations of our differentiated therapies. Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, despite the impact of Delta in summer seasonality, global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe. As we expanded commercially, we continue to experience high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes for patients. And we remain committed to employing our high-touch clinical support model. We are pleased with our level of site activation during the quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our previous full-year guidance of $80 million to $100 million and estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025. And we're pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales were $217 million, up 6% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. Despite the Q3 resurgence and COVID cases we were encouraged to see continued SABR procedure growth across most regions. We remain encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the KONECT RESILIA valves conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve. This advanced tissue treatment is increasing supported by growing body of real-world evidence as demonstrated at the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons annual meeting earlier this year. Registry data confirmed excellent real-world outcomes with INSPIRIS RESILIA in patients under the age of 60. As patients increase their awareness of surgical valve choices, we believe that they are learning about the durability potential of RESILIA and engaging with their positions to choose this technology. In summary, we have confidence that our full year 2021 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-teens for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market growth and adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the Surgical Structural Heart market that we serve will grow mid-single-digits through 2026. In Critical Care, third quarter global sales were $213 million up 17% on an underlying basis versus the year-ago period. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines led primarily by strong HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S. Our True Wave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to the elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. and demand for products used in high-risk surgery also grew year-over-year in addition to demand for the ClearSight non-invasive finger cup used in elective procedures. In summary, we continue to believe the Critical Care will grow revenue in the low double-digit range in 2021. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks Scott. We're very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance despite the headwinds associated with the pandemic. And as patients and clinicians increasingly choose transcatheter valve therapy, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity. We are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy, because we believe there is a broad group of patients still suffering from Structural Heart disease and the pandemic's impact will wane. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Vijay like so many others, we really struggle with precisely for projecting the pandemic. Edwards's business is strong all the fundamentals are in a great place, and we know that there are many patients with structural heart disease in particular that are in need. We feel great about it from that perspective, but the pandemic ends up having impact on hospitals and their ability to be able to handle the volumes and we find it very spotty. It's regional in nature and the good news is we're watching the Delta variant come down in the U.S. and that's where we felt most of the impact and that's very good. Of course, there is concerned of will there be some kind of a winter surge that is not apparent at this point. So those things are always possible. We have by and large modelled the fact that, we think things are going to get gradually better. We have taken into account where we are in October. And in October, we saw run rates that were similar to what we saw in the last couple of months of Q3. And so that has also gone into our thinking. So, I don't know if that answers your question, Vijay? Yes. No, it's a great point, Vijay, and it is one of the pluses that's associated with TAVR that, often there isn't an ICU stay. But when we watch what happens with various hospitals and sometimes whether it's for staffing reasons or just the fact that they're swamped with COVID patients, they will just put up the stop sign and decide that they're just not going to do procedures and whether they are elective or resource consuming or not. We're probably more impacted by the ICU capability. But it's not always the case. Sometimes it's just broadly across the hospital so I don't have one answer for all because it tends to be a little bit more snowflakes with this hospital being a bit different, but hopefully it provides you with a little bit of color. Yeah, thanks, Bob. It's a really good question. You're probably stay close to our team that watch daily sales each day and adjust their own feelings based on how things change almost on a daily basis. And things, it gets tough. And I hate to get too granular, but the things are a little better today than they were even earlier in the month. But I hate to get too granular on that, Bob. In general, we tried to give you some information. I let you know that October was not so dissimilar than the end of Q3. So, it's not -- we didn't want to send a signal that all of a sudden October is back to the kind of thing that we were experiencing in Q2. So, we're not experiencing that kind of an environment yet, but we're overall optimistic. I mean, we talked to a lot of folks, anecdotally, obviously these -- the trends that I mentioned of Delta, improving is something we think is going to pay off, we think. Often that -- maybe TAVR is a bit of a trailing indicator of what's happening with COVID, that the cases ultimately turn into ICU stays, and it probably affects our caseload a little bit later, but that's a bit speculative on our part. We don't have clarity on when the timing for that will be we say it'll be next year. We're sticking with our date and our belief that we will have approval by the end of next year. But we really don't have clarity on when it's going to be presented. That'll be one that we'll hopefully, we'll have a little bit more visibility when we get to the investor conference, Bob. I'm trying to give you a sense for it at that time. The short answer is no, it's been very similar feeling that we've had throughout the year that was the case in the past. We continue to think that the top two competitors make up about 85% of the sales in Europe, and all the rest, which is a full complement of competitors, make up the other 15%. We really haven't seen any significant shifts in that, if that's helpful. Thanks Josh, you're on a key point, and we do talk about it quite a bit inside. We don't have perfect visibility and perfect data. So much of what we rely on our anecdotal reports when we spent a lot of time with our customers and front-line clinical specialists to try and gain some kind of perspective. It's tough for us to nail the timing and magnitude of this, but clearly, we feel like we got a small lift in Q2 from patients that came into the system that had probably deferred care. If we reflect back on the total pandemic when things first stopped back in 2020, back in the March/April timeframe, it's difficult for us to say that we saw those patients come back into the system. But differently, it felt like the -- last winter's patients did, indeed  some of those. some small quantity showed up and supplemented Q2. It's not a giant number but its additive, and we speculate the similar kind of thing might happen as a result of the patients that have deferred care during the Delta variant. During the Delta variant we're speculating again, we may indeed have had these patients that actually saw their physicians and got diagnosed but that the actual treaters in regional hotspots weren't there to provide the therapy. So, we think there is some reason why this might come back exactly when it might come back is very difficult but as COVID wanes, were hoping that indeed, we see a similar phenomenon as we saw in Q2. Thanks, Josh. I wish I could tell you the problem was low risk. We think there's an under-treatment problem across all the risk spectrums, whether it's high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for surgery. We're still -- I think early innings is a good way to characterize it. We still think that there are many patients that should be receiving therapy that don't. It's for a variety of reasons and in many cases, they are just not aware of the option of TAVR being available for them and being an appropriate for them. And so, it's a key initiative for us, we've been progress, but the progress has been slow and steady and we're not close. I don't know if I would put tremendous stock in that penetration number. In general, we think penetration rates across the border are even worse than that. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. No, your observation was correct. We saw a far more impact in the U.S. than we saw in Europe. Our colleagues in Europe, by comparison, were pretty healthy growth rates. And you'll notice in my comment that if you go back to Q3 of last year, it's not as though Europe was really doing poorly. They actually had a growth quarter versus 2019. I think all I want to say high-single-digit growth or something last year. So, this is growth on top of that growth, which is pretty significant considering this therapy was introduced in Europe back in '07, it's pretty mature. And here we are still growing even during a pandemic. They, for whatever reason, have the Delta variant didn't seem to impact the European centers the same way it did in the U.S. Yes. Thanks. Yes. No. As we indicated, we're looking forward to having PASCAL approved and again it would be approved for DMR by the end of '22 in our views. We're already taking some of the initial steps to build some capabilities and will assemble a dedicated field team and we will be implementing our high-touch model. And they are really -- we're going to focus on just getting excellent real-world outcomes. We're going to take advantage of all the learnings that we've had from launching TAVR around the globe and launching TMTT in Europe. In general, we do consider PASCAL a premium therapy and would also implement our premium pricing plan that would be consistent with what we've done elsewhere in the world. Hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we would approach this. Thanks Danielle. It's a little early to say, this is going to be an interesting evolution. In some cases, the same people that do TAVR will might do mitral cases and other there's dedicated teams. It's a little too early for us to say we're going to get into it. We'll have more to talk about when we're together at the investor conference. But right now, I really don't have any specific color for you. Yeah. Thanks. So, we were very pleased to get the low-risk reimbursement approval. That happen ed mid-quarter, I want to say, sometime in the August. There are indeed new centers that get added. Those get added on a pretty deliberate basis. And those new centers tend to be slow to ramp up. There are significant regulatory requirements that are necessary to fire up new centers. But having said that, it's a dramatically under-treated disease in Japan. They have a very large elderly population. And when we think about it in terms of, for example, TAVR per million, we say, \"Boy, there's still a long way to go. \" So, we're very pleased at the growth rate, the growth rate in Japan was even higher than our international growth. And the reimbursement is important. It's an important key. It's exciting to be able to get that and hopefully that begins helping Japanese clinicians redefine the importance of TAVR for their patients and I think we've got to take it for granted that low-risk was -- is already present in other places around the world but it just has been in Japan until this last quarter. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. You might recall Cecilia, that early on we said that there was impact on our trial enrollments. We're not experiencing that the same way during this flare up of Delta. It doesn't make it easier, but hospitals have done a nice job of adjusting and adapt. They have very committed teams. And so, whether it's our trials in TAVR, our trials in TMTT, it feels like we've done well. We basically feel that our trials' timing has not been impacted by this latest surge. Thanks Larry and as you might imagine, it's difficult to estimate shares, but frankly, we haven't really gone into this thinking that that's our focus. Our focus has been to get outstanding clinical results. And we focus on that both within our trials and within our commercial experience, and that's where we've pushed our team. And when you ask me what's it going to take to get your share up, it's going to be impressive clinical results. That will show up 2 ways, one in the day-to-day experiences of clinicians and patients and the other is when they actually get a chance to see some of our results. And you see more and more data that is going to become available over time as you see clinical information. So even at the upcoming TV -- or TCT, I think you'll see more information on some of our early clinical experience. At this point, we're not even in every country in Europe but our focus just to underline the point again is not on share. This is a really big opportunity. There are so many patients with mitral regurgitation and there's many that are just not indicated not being well-served today. That's where our focus is. Thanks, Adam. Yeah, when we talked about our results, whether it was our global results or our U.S. results, what we said it was broad-based, but the procedure volume, growth, and the Edwards growth were comparable. We really didn't see anything that was noteworthy here in terms of talking about share. So, we've mentioned before that we have a full complement of competitors in Europe. And so that may be some kind of a leading indicator, but we just haven't seen anything in the data in the U.S. Sure. Yeah. I'll just pile on there, Anthony. Thanks, it's a good question. If you go back, historically, in the early days of TAVR, we really counted on the physicians that did TAVR to educate their referring base d. And that's the way that we counted on the word getting out and I don't know we were under the impression that that actually would be sufficient. But we've learned over the years that that's dramatically insufficient. And so, as Scott said, we've gone on a number of roads here to make sure that the referral base is, indeed, educated. We've made some good progress there, although, we're far from satisfied in terms of where we are right now. But to be really specific, going all the way upstream to consumer, we do believe that that could be a valuable lever. We're specifically doing some experimenting in that regard and maybe have some more specific things to share with you when you come to the Investor Conference. Thanks. So, it's a good question, Joanne. I mean, if you were to ask our teams here, you're going to keep growing at 17%. I think they'd say, no, that's not realistic. That we got some help this quarter by some large U.S. capital orders that really helped out. And that made a difference. Now, overall, are we pleased with what's going on in Critical Care? Is there more innovation than ever? Are they sustaining a pretty healthy growth rate that are better than I think med-tech averages? I think all of those are true, and we're very proud of that, or we're going to continue hitting it hard in that regard. But in terms of being able to maintain these kind of growth rates that we did in this quarter. That's not likely. Yeah, thanks Pito. We've said this before, so I apologize for taking you through it again. But remember there is character -- this characterization of patients by high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, was a characterization done by FDA as a regulatory pathway for TAVR to help make sure that the oldest sickest patients were treated first at the highest risk to try and minimize the risks associated with the new therapy. If you were to -- when you actually look at any patient, their key concern is not whether there are risks surviving surgery. It's -- what is the risk for survival? What is it liking the live with TAVR versus live with aortic stenosis? And that's the real question. We spend less time, and frankly clinicians and patients, spend less time talking about whether they are low-risk or intermediate. We really don't differentiate in that regard. Having said that, what do we think -- how did patients behave in the third quarter? We -- as I tried to infer before, we don't have perfect visibility there, but we think they were indeed seeing another doctor, they were indeed getting diagnosed, they were indeed getting screened. But there were a number of cases where the treating hospitals themselves just stopped taking patients, and that was the primary impact in the quarter. We really haven't gotten specific on that. We really don't have specific comments. But as you might imagine, we're committed to -- when we say that we believe that we're going to have 2D approved by late 2002, that naturally infers that we're close to having our enrollment completed, and that will allow us to prepare for the PMA and go through that process. So, a lot of that has to happen. We'll get into a little more granularity when we're together at the investor conference. Yes, it's a good question. I don't have personal knowledge of that trial, and so I can't really comment about it. The AHA are a strong organization and good partners and I think they really care about patients with AS. But I am not sure precisely what trial that you're referring to both -- you know how we feel about asymptomatic patients. We feel like these are patients that should be treated. The decide via of differing treatment and waiting for symptoms as an outdated thought process. And we're very committed to change that through rigorous clinical trials. Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mike, and I will welcome any additional questions by telephone."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Diego. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2021 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.  Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the Company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are included in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Mark. \u201cWe were encouraged by the clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. Vaccine adoption in key regions have contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment. At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day.  We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients. Last year, we noted that we\u2019re in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter. \nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Mike. I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we are expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we are optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards.  Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter. Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year\u2019s second quarter due to COVID. Our underlying two year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving.  The much stronger than expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom-line resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021.  For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.  Now, regarding second half margins, we are intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions.  In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27.  While public health conditions remain uncertain, we are projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56.  Now I will cover additional details of our results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial cost responding to COVID. This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.  We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales, compared to $275 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs including performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year, and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro.  We are planning to see a ramp up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related restrictions subside to support continued growth. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%.  Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million, or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity. We are pointing ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.  For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range. During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.14. This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier.  This reduction reflects accounting adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous acquisitions. This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance.  Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%. This rate included a larger than expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.  Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million, compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales, compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year.  Relative to our April guidance, FX rates positively impacted our second quarter EPS by a penny. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million, less capital spending of $69 million.  Before turning the call back over to Mike, I\u2019ll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million.  In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85. In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program. We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range.  And with that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Mike. \nMike Mussallem: Hey, thanks, Scott. So, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2021. To serve the many patients suffering from Structural Heart Disease, we never stopped investing in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity.  As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity. Our foundation of leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued success.  And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. \nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I am excited to announce that our 2021 Investor Conference will take place on Wednesday, December 8th, at our headquarters here in Irvine, California. This event will include updates on our latest technologies, the use on longer term market potential, as well as our outlook for 2022. Please look for more information on our website next month.  With that, we are ready to take questions now, Diego. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you and good afternoon, and congrats on such strong performance across the board. I just \u2013 I have two quick questions on the guidance. First is just on the short-term and some of the comments you made about this quarter. Just curious, you mentioned the backlog dynamic which is not something that you really talked a lot about before. But then a major factor in the quarter, can you quantify that? And any thoughts on what that looks like in Q3 of the back half? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Bob. And, we were pleased with the results. They were broad based. Your observation is correct. We really haven\u2019t talked about this much in the past. Most of our data historically have come from talking to our heart teams really around the world, but especially in the U.S. And when we talk to them, they really don\u2019t note a difference in their backlogs, compared to what they\u2019ve seen in the past.  But we believe based on a number of sources, some of anecdotal conversations, some of it what\u2019s going on with other companies like insurers or others in the healthcare space that noted much more patient activity. And we believe that this flow of patients, so patients visiting their primary care physicians.  Patients going back to their general cardiologist, their general cardiologist referring them on a heart team, all of the things that we think were potentially delayed that there was a real pick up in the second quarter and because of the rate of treatment being much larger than anything we\u2019ve ever seen in our path, we believe that that\u2019s in there.  It\u2019s not based on, we only have heart data, Bob, to quantify how much of that was, but we believe that that was a key part of what happened. \nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you for that. Just curious. And then that kind of feeds into my second question which is also around the guidance for the back half on total revenue. So I think you called for roughly a 3% decline sequentially from what you did in Q2 and then, Q4 being kind of flat with Q2 and I am just curious maybe for Mike or for just Scott, maybe talk about some of the moving parts that went into that guidance. Do you expect little bit of a decline sequentially and then, Q4 similar to Q2. I might have thought that would have been a little bit higher given the momentum. But just curious the moving parts you are assuming there. \nMike Mussallem: Yes. I mean, you\u2019ve got it right and I\u2019ll invite Scott to come in and add more color to it. But you are right, we did exit with momentum and it was strong momentum coming out of Q2. But at the same time, we are mindful of the fact that we probably got some help in Q2 from some of these patients coming off the sideline. Also, all of us are all acutely aware of what\u2019s going on with the pandemic and the recent surge that\u2019s happening and although that hasn\u2019t had dramatic impact on the healthcare system so far, we think it can have impact. And so, that\u2019s also baked into our thinking.  Q3, we think there is going to be a pronounced seasonality associated with people both in the healthcare system and patients themselves wanting to get away and take a vacation. And so, all those went into our thinking. And I don\u2019t know, Scott if there is much to add to that, but. \nScott Ullem: No, that\u2019s a good summary. If we would not have exceeded our Q2 sales expectations by as much as we did, you probably would have seen a different sequential trend from Q2 to Q3 as we continue to grow and recover through this pandemic. But we just succeeded Q2 so much that we do think we\u2019ll see some of that seasonality that Mike talked about and then, going back up to a more normalized level of sales when we get into the fourth quarter. \nBob Hopkins: Fair enough. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question. \nVijay Kumar : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice print here. Mike, maybe a big picture question, when I look at the guidance here, the beat in the quarter came from TAVR. I think there was some nervousness around slowdown in Asia-Pac, Japan, due to the COVID outbreak. How \u2013 when you think about those regions, how those regions normalize?  And given U.S. was so strong, it offset that weakness when I look at the guide, every other segment was raised. So I am curious when you thought about the guide, what was it? Some concerns around these outbreaks, is that what went into the thought process around TAVR guidance? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. One of the things you have to be a little bit careful of when you look at growth rates and use that as a way of measuring Q2 is to be a little bit more reflective on what the climate was like in Q2 of last year. So, Japan just didn\u2019t declined as much as the U.S. and Europe last year. And so, while the growth rate looks like less in Japan or it looks like it was less of a performer actually, Japan was doing quite well and grew very nicely.  Similarly, Europe didn\u2019t get hit quite as hard in Q2 as the U.S. did \u2013 as the U.S. really got hit hard. So, Europe has actually been performing, we think at a pretty high level. Now having said that, you correctly note that, hey, you know, Japan is in a near lockdown in portions or regions.  There is portions of Europe that are still troublesome, although there is encouraging signs in Europe as well. I just saw some data this morning that said vaccination rates in Europe are comparable to U.S. vaccination rates. And we know of some places where that are under pressure in the U.S. So, we\u2019ve taken all that into account. We\u2019ve provided our guidance. But when we look backward at Q2, we feel like we saw a strength across each of the regions. \nVijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And then, one maybe on the TAVR portion, Structural Heart. I want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say mid singles at growth outlook through 2025? I think, there has been some concerns about cannibalization. I am curious, is that a comment on the entire market being up mid-singles or is that most of it for Edwards? \nMike Mussallem: No, so, what we were commenting on was, the total market and we said that that total market, that\u2019s $1.8 billion will grow in the mid-single-digits through 2026. Now that total market is \u2013 this total, what we call Surgical Structural Heart, so it\u2019s not just valves. It has more than that in it. What we are trying to send the signal that we think that\u2019s still a growth market and that is with the TAVR impact. So, we think TAVR is definitely going to have impact on surgery during that period of time. But it\u2019s going to grow in spite of that. Okay. We\u2019ve enjoyed some very nice growth for a number of reasons. A lot of it\u2019s built on just the strength of our premium RESILIA platform. \nScott Ullem: I would just add to that, one of the things that happens when there is a greater awareness of structural heart disease and valvular disease is that more patients are just coming into the system. And many of those patients who have isolated aortic stenosis are great candidates for TAVR. But there are a lot of patients who come into the system who need surgery and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we expect that business to continue to grow. \nVijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful perspective, Scott. Thank you guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. \nLarry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the nice quarter. Mike, I am glad to hear you talk about the trend you are seeing in your mitral and tricuspid businesses. The $80 million to $100 million guidance for this year, what percent is mitral? What percent is tricuspid? And how significant clinical sales in that TMTT number? \nMike Mussallem: So, clinical are a portion of it. But it\u2019s minor. I don\u2019t know the exact, Larry. But I would guess it\u2019s in the \u2013 maybe it\u2019s in the 10% range of overall sales. The market itself feels like the growth of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid did pick up in the quarter. And so, we see it. It\u2019s still a market that\u2019s driven by mitral more than tricuspid. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful. \nLarry Biegelsen : No, it\u2019s very helpful. I mean, I just I\u2019d love to hear your thinking about that business beyond 2021. I mean, $80 million to $100 million is a pretty big pick up from what you did in 2020. How do you think about that business going forward? Thanks for taking the question. \nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks, Larry. Yes, when we said $80 million at the beginning of the year that was about a doubling from last year. So, now we think it will more than double. But I think you know about how we feel about this market. We formed a business unit around it and have an awful lot of really important differentiated innovations going on in this space.  So, we have a high confidence level that this is going to be important. It\u2019s a road we are very focused on making sure that we have great outcomes and that\u2019s key to us. We work on having rigorous pivotal trials. We have differentiated therapies and we working on having great real world outcomes with our high touch model. We\u2019ve said that we think it\u2019s going to be more than $3 billion by 2025. So it gives you a signal as to what we think where the market is maybe $1 billion in that neighborhood today. \nLarry Biegelsen : Thanks, Mike. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robby Marcus with JPMorgan Chase. Please state your question. \nRobert Marcus : Yes. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can start some P&L question. Scott, gross margin was a touch light in the quarter. Just maybe walk us through how you get back up to the 76%, 77% guidance through the back part of the year. What gives you the confidence? \nScott Ullem: Well, it was a touch light, but keep in mind there are a couple of moving pieces. One was, we had about 180 basis point hit from foreign exchange, primarily due to these hedge contracts where they are downsides and it works opposite of the benefit that we get with the translation of sales from outside of the U.S. But that was more than slumped by 230 basis points from manufacturing efficiencies and lower special COVID expenses than what we had in the second quarter. So, you got FX and manufacturing efficiencies at play and we came in 10 basis points short at the bottom end of our range for the full year gross margin guidance. As we are probably, right now, looking at something that is closer to the lower end of the 76% to 77% range. But it\u2019s probably too early to get more granular than that Robby. \nRobert Marcus : Great. And while we are on the P&L, I\u2019ll use another here. The accounting charge that was a benefit this quarter. I didn\u2019t hear what it was related to. If you don\u2019t mind, just what it\u2019s letting us know what it\u2019s tied to. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. \nScott Ullem: Sure. Sure. So it was accounting adjustments that were associated with some lower expectations in making future milestone payments connected to some past acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. So, the accounting associated with those is, we evaluate the probabilities and the timing and the assumptions around whether we might make those milestone payments and in this case, we think there is some lower likelihood of some of those. And so, we run it through as a non \u2013 or as a GAAP gain, but not something that shows up in our non-GAAP earnings per share. \nRobert Marcus : Okay. Is it any specific deals you can talk to? Or is it just the overall portfolio? \nScott Ullem: Well, there are two primarily deals where we have earn outs. One is, Valtech, which is the parent company of the CARDIOMAN product and the other is Harpoon. And we\u2019ll get into the details beyond that. But those are the two big deals where you\u2019ve got exposure to future milestones and where the expectations for those move up and move down over time and we run those accounting results through the P&L. \nRobert Marcus : Great. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. \nPito Chickering: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is a question on the growth in new centers versus established centers in 2Q. If you look at into the back half of the year, are there any constraints that the sales people, manufacturing or center capacity could limit that growth?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. We feel like this quarter we saw broad growth across all size centers. And so, I think that\u2019s most noteworthy. Maybe even more than we have seen in the past real strength from some of the big centers. We continued to add centers this quarter. I would say, it was kind of a normal addition kind of what we\u2019ve been adding right along. We are probably at an 800 plus level in terms of centers right now. And so, that\u2019s going to be probably a diminishing importance. But the ones that we are adding now are quite small centers and don\u2019t really have material impact to our results. \nPito Chickering: Okay. And the question for your margins, you were talking about investments in clinical trials at mid-teens going forward this year. But I look as you are increasing those investments. I am just curious sort of what changed in the last 90 days to increase that - those investments? \nScott Ullem: You are talking about clinical trials?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, so, we\u2019ve got multiple pivotal underway right now. Five in TMTT and then we got other ones in TAVR and surgical and as we continue to enroll patients, those clinical trial expenses increase. Keep in mind, we incurred expenses at 2.1 at the point of treatment. But then secondly, we follow these patients lot of times out to ten years. And so, we got this increasing and recurring clinical expense that is part of our strategy. We are trying to build a robust body of clinical evidence and it\u2019s important part of how we are intending to grow the top-line over time. \nScott Ullem: And I\u2019ll add to that, Pito, although things definitely picked up in Q2 in terms of clinical trial activities, it could go even faster in the future and so that\u2019s what we anticipate. \nPito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question. \nMatt Miksic: Hey. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, maybe a follow-up to Pito\u2019s question around centers. I know just that TDT some of the information you had up around the meeting included some comments on the number of interventional centers around the world \u2013 I mean, around the country that had chatter that we are also performing TAVR.  And the reason I ask is, is that, in the past, you talked about there is sneaking up on maybe 850 centers in the U.S. and not really going to go to 1,100, 1,200 centers as we have cardiac surgery. But there is sort of comparing the number of centers that are doing stenting but not TAVR seems a little bit like a new way of highlighting the underpenetrated nature of the adoption.  I am just wondering if you could speak a little bit about that if it\u2019s reading that right or where you are exactly in that curve? And then, I have one follow-up. \nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, I am sorry, if we weren\u2019t clear on that. I mean, we have been \u2013 I think pretty consistent since the new NCD was approved a few years that we thought this was going to head toward around 850 centers, that continues to be our belief. Nothing has really changed in that regard and it\u2019s probably constrained by the way that the NCD is written.  We probably argue that it might have been larger, but it is what it is. And so, that\u2019s where it is. But I really wouldn\u2019t focus overly on number of centers. For example, in the U.S., when you think about what the potential is for TAVR, because the real issue is patients coming off the sidelines.  There are many patients with severe AS that for one reason or another don\u2019t get diagnosed or don\u2019t ever make it to a hear team and treatment. And that is going to be the key to the \u2013 really the growth of TAVR overall. And we are fortunate to have a great procedure that has terrific results and we are making progress on encouraging patients to come back.  Now, it\u2019s a challenge, obviously with COVID, because those same patients that are vulnerable to COVID are those that are \u2013 have very similar characteristics of severe AS patients. But it\u2019s a real opportunity. And the other thing that we find is, there is much conversation about health disparities this day \u2013 these days. That\u2019s true in spades for sever aortic stenosis patients. There are real health disparities. And so, as the overall system looks to tackle that, we think that\u2019s a bit of a tailwind to our efforts. \nMatt Miksic: Excellent. And just \u2013 you mentioned that you are growing similar pace to the volumes in the various regions that you are \u2013 we are operating in. Any thoughts that are contemplation of share eating or share loss. You had some significant gains in the past year and a half for a variety of reasons. And so, anything changing on the share front? \nMike Mussallem: Yes, so, we are \u2013 that\u2019s always very difficult to measure at this point in time and that\u2019s one that you get a chance to look back on after everyone has reported and you get a chance to see the PBT registry. It\u2019s not truly our key focus. Most of our growth really comes from these patients coming into the system rather than any sort of changes in share. But as we say, we really think that those positions were stable in the quarter. \nMatt Miksic: Great. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. \nCecilia Furlong : Hey. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I wanted to start with TMTT. Just really, what you were able to do in 2Q in terms of being able to access new sites, open new sites and then as you contemplate that 80 to 100 for the year, will it\u2019s factored in some \u2013 a new site opening versus just continued penetration in your existing sites? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. No, it is a key part of our growth strategy. So, that\u2019s a correct observation. We have been involved in a lot of physician training. We have a high touch model. So we are there and we really help make sure that when people start up, they start up the right way. I think at this point, we are in double-digit countries, more than ten countries across Europe and are opening centers in all those places. And so, a significant increase to our team and of course, a lot of rigor in terms of trying to back that up. \nCecilia Furlong : Okay. Thank you. And just on Japan, as well. Off of the recent traction, just thinking about reimbursement heading into 2022, just the growth drivers you\u2019ve seen recently, but how you are thinking about really opening these centers in that reason going forward in 2022 and new centers really being the growth driver as you look forward over the next few years? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. I think, I think we talk about it every time that we are speaking to you that there is a really significant undertreatment in Japan, maybe at such a large elderly population that their treatment rates should be much higher and there are number of structural issues that span in the way of Japan getting that done and we try and become students of that and we are making some progress. Adding new centers is important and valuable. One of the things that I think may not be clear to most as we\u2019ve only had a high surgical risk indication up until now. And so, we are going to jump to a low surgical risk indication. And once that reimbursement comes in place, which happens this quarter or we expect to happen this quarter. That\u2019s when there should be some real reaction from clinicians and in terms of treating these patients. So, we look forward to adding these new centers and \u2013 but we are also mindful of just COVID in Japan. So, it\u2019s one we are very positive about in the long-term. But a little uncertain in the short-term. \nCecilia Furlong : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I got one longer term question on margins. You are spending a lot down in R&D and SG&A, but also have a lot of investments in front of you. So, just curious how you think longer term, how you balance the spending versus margin expansion? \nMike Mussallem: So, longer term, we do think we are going to continue to get some benefits from scale and we think about margins, I guess, in all three areas, gross margin, R&D, SG&A. On the gross margin line, you\u2019ve seen us expand gross margins. And even as we have invested a lot into our physical footprint of production facilities around the world, we are getting more and more efficient as our volumes increase. And so that\u2019s going to continue to be helpful, I think. On the R&D side, we are going to continue to invest heavily. And that may not in the short-term be a source for additional leverage. But longer term we do think revenues are going to outpace operating expenses including SG&A where we are getting more benefits of scale in our administrative, some of our back-office functions can support a bigger business around the globe. And so, we think we\u2019ve got opportunities to over time incrementally expand the operating margin. \nTravis Steed: Alright. That\u2019s helpful. On the international business, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve mentioned any update on China and how that\u2019s going. I notice Medtronics filed a study today in TAVR for their device in China. So, curious if there is any update on China and are you looking at other markets to move into as well, longer term? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, for us, China was in terms of \u2013 THV was a minor contributor to sales in the quarter. It actually did very nicely in Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valves. But we are still launching there. We\u2019ve got a very deliberate and methodical approach that\u2019s aimed at having great patient outcomes. And so, we are going to be looking at this as a long-term opportunity or an intermediate to long-term opportunity then we are going to try and take it from that perspective. It doesn\u2019t help right now that \u2013 some of us can\u2019t travel to China. And so, those kind of things tend to be obstacles, but overall team that\u2019s out there executing. \nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks for taking the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead. \nJosh Jennings : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to just start get an understanding of your comments around patient backlog in TAVR or checks with some physician experts are anecdotal, but they are relying that when they clear their patients, most of their they one even said they can\u2019t find a patient that\u2019s saying that they delayed their procedure because of COVID. And so, is your backlog, when you talk about primary care physician offices. Is this just the incidence in 2020 that these \u2013 that just were not diagnosed are now coming back to the channel and there are just more patients with aortic stenosis that have not been diagnosed yet and kind of getting diagnosed whether it\u2019s primary care physicians or general cardiologists and then moving to the channel. Is that the primary thrust of your backlog comment? \nMike Mussallem: We think so. The risk of over simplifying, yes, indeed, we believe that during COVID, people were more fearful of COVID and entering the system with COVID than they were concerned about their AS in many cases. We even had some clinicians tell us, when patients are home and they are not very active, they may not even demonstrate some of the symptoms they might have if they were more active.  But we do hear that they are coming back now. It\u2019s been again, anecdotal. So, I am a little hesitant to say that we know exactly where that\u2019s coming from, Josh. So, for example, we had one physician at a leading that tells you things that the patients that are coming back now are sicker than they were before and that will show up in the numbers.  But again, totally anecdotal one all, but we\u2019ve heard enough of this that we believe that their patients that are coming back into the system and we saw the kind of a surge in the second quarter. \nJosh Jennings : Thanks for that. And maybe just one quick follow-up on a similar topic. There is stronger adoption of handheld ultrasound technologies, more technologies coming into play. Are there any enabling technologies that will enhance or accelerate the diagnosis of these undiagnosed aortic stenosis patients in the primary care office or the general cardiologist offices giving you some optimism about the deeper penetration of TAVR resume forward here? Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thank you. We think there is a host of technologies that are still pretty early and we\u2019ve been backers of some of these that could really help with the diagnosis of valvular disease. There is, it comes from many directions and we think as the world digitizes and there is more handheld devices, and there is more ability to bounce signals off the cloud, whether it\u2019s EKGs or stethoscopes or and handheld devices of all sort, especially that can listen to heart sounds that this is going to be enhanced. I\u2019ll avoid doing a commercial for any particular companies, but there are numbers that are pursuing this exact thing and we think it\u2019s a very helpful sort of megatrend for us. \nJosh Jennings : Great. Thanks a lot.\nMike Mussallem: Sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nAnthony Petrone : Great. Congrats on a quarter. Hope everyone is well. Two quick ones. One would be just on the competitive dynamics in Europe in particular and just maybe a quick update on the pricing dynamics there just given that the environment is a little bit more richer with competitors in that region of the world.  And then, the second would be, on the $7 billion global TAVR outlook, that figure has not factored in asymptomatic. So, just wondering taking the temperature here on asymptomatic latest thoughts on size that opportunity and how that market opportunity can be untapped over time? Thanks \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. Well, I am sure that everybody, Anthony, gets a chance to track what\u2019s going on with the various companies that are engaged in TAVR. In general, in Europe, there is a pretty full complement of competitors. It seems there was that the two leading companies probably account to close to 85% of the volume in Europe.  So it gives you a bit of a sense, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s exactly helpful for what you are looking for. Was there more, let\u2019s see, that\u2019s $7 billion opportunity, you are right. It has very little asymptomatic in it. We have a big early TAVR trial that\u2019s going on right now. And you also heard that we initiated a trial of patients with moderate AS. Those are not in that number. So, I tried to cover it in our general remarks.  The $7 billion in 2025, we don\u2019t see as sort of at the top of some curve. This has the potential to grow significantly more, particularly if we can demonstrate the value of TAVR for these patients that today have \u2013 or not really indicated and we think these trials have the potential to do that. \nAnthony Petrone : Thanks again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please state your question. \nJoanne Wuensch : Thank you for taking the question and a nice quarter. Two quick questions. If PASCAL is approved in the United States by the end of next year, does that mean data at ACC? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. We don\u2019t have great visibility as to when we are going to see data. Certainly, we are going to see it sometime next year. But I am not sure what medium we are going to see that. It\u2019s too early for us to be able to judge it. But what we think from a timing perspective is that, we should have that approval by the end of next year, which means we are probably launching and then you could see it in the numbers in 2023. \nJoanne Wuensch : And I think that the TMTT numbers in outside the United States is inching up nicely. Is there anything that you are learning from that process or from that launch that will make it easier to bring it into United States? And thank you. \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne. So, obviously, we have learned a lot from those experiences and as we mentioned, we have a high touch model. So we are in every case. So, we get the chance to learn about that on a regular basis. We are highly focused not necessarily on just trying to drive sales, but to make sure that we get great results and we\u2019ve been really pleased so far that we\u2019ve had differentiated outcomes. And that\u2019s base to focus, because we are in this for the long run. We know that these patients today could be served better and we are striving to do exactly that. \nJoanne Wuensch : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please state your question. \nDanielle Antalffy : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just \u2013 and congrats on a good quarter. Just a follow-up to Josh\u2019s question on the backlog. I guess, Mike, I am just curious, previously, you talked about this knocking a backlog type of market given the high mortality rate for these patients if they don\u2019t get treated. So, I guess, I am curious about the increased level of confidence that there is a backlog, first of all. And second of all, is it really about low risk patients and if you have a sense of whether you are treating a higher percentage of low risk patients right now. Any color you can give on the patient mix that gives you conviction that this is a backlog work down versus just strong underlying volume? \nMike Mussallem: Sure. And again, Dan, we are trying to share with you our best thinking on what we believe. We believe that this occurred upstream, part of what was driving our comments in the past and you are exactly right. We\u2019ve said, hey, AS patients don\u2019t score very well and we think that\u2019s true. But remember, we said there were 10,000 patients treated in \u2013 I mean, 20,000 patients treated in Q2 and 30,000 this Q2. So, big difference and so, it\u2019s that \u2013 so, all those 10,000 patients all come. It doesn\u2019t take very many to move numbers like they moved in Q2. So, we believe that it\u2019s patients across all risk levels. Even I think, people sometimes don\u2019t understand the low risk patients are quite old in many cases. And so, it\u2019s not just simply the newer indication. It\u2019s broadly that these patients that were elderly and had risk of COVID were hesitant to enter the system. We believe that they are more likely when signs of optimism really reaches a peak in the second quarter to reenter the system and be treated. And that we got some lift out of that. But we don\u2019t have perfect visibility on that. So, I can\u2019t be more quantitative. \nDanielle Antalffy : No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Mike. That\u2019s it for me.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please state your question. \nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Two related to clinical trials and so such a big part of the pipeline story today. First, just to piggyback on Joanne\u2019s question. Has CLASP 2d completed enrollment yet, because it would seem like that would have to happen soon to make a spring meeting. \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. You know what, we don\u2019t share the details of exactly where we are on that. But we do feel like we have a fair amount of visibility into the pipeline. We\u2019ve been progressing really well, feel like we are on track to have our enrollment in place and to be able to make our submissions, so that we could have an end of year next year approval. \nChris Pasquale: Okay. And then, you touched, Mike, a little bit earlier, but there is a lot of overlap between the patients you guys are treating in many of these studies and those that were most impacted by COVID. Do you have any concern about COVID in reducing noise into these studies that could complicate interpretation of the data down the road? Just curious how you are thinking about that. If you are doing anything to try and head that off? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. Chris, that\u2019s a good observation. Yes, we are concerned about that. Especially those studies where rehospitalization or hospitalization is measured as an indicator in both the controlled group and the test group, those things can definitely get affected by, during a moment like a COVID outbreak. So, it is of concern. It\u2019s very much on FDA\u2019s radar screen and I am sure all companies that do trials that have those sort of end play.  Our PIs are all about it. And then, the good news is, between our principal investigators and the FDA people are cognizant of it and are working together to try and deal with those variabilities. \nChris Pasquale: Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please state your question. \nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Again just want to see if I could get more specificities from you on regions that you are operating in that aren\u2019t doing so well. You mentioned there is some in Europe and some concerns in Japan and APAC. Just want to think about how we should view them improving or getting worse in Q3 versus Q2. Could you give us any insight into that? \nMike Mussallem: Yes. I mean, what happens is, to get really discrete and go country-by-country might be misleading, because we would get into countries that are pretty small, but might not make a difference. We tend to look at it in terms of the U.S. in total, Europe in total, Japan, as a region and then the rest of the world.  When we look at each of those discretely, even though each one has its hotspots. So, for example, you know very well where those hotspots are in the U.S. The places that are vulnerable to low growth. But the U.S. in total, looks quite positive. The same thing in Europe. There are countries, some of the Nordic countries, we can \u2013 I can go on to greater level of specifics that are struggling more.  But overall, Europe is doing pretty well. They performed at a high level in the second quarter. Japan, in a lockdown, but then at the same time they have the approval for low risk and we have optimism about the future.  So, each of these is positive. But even the rest of the world has put very nice growth. So, we don\u2019t have a hotspot that probably affects a major region. More of those are going to be smaller in their nature, if that makes sense, Matt. \nMatt Taylor: Yes. That\u2019s good color. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. And that\u2019s at the end of today\u2019s Question-And-Answer Session. I will now turn it back to management for closing remarks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day. ",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Mike. I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we are expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we are optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards.  Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter. Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year's second quarter due to COVID. Our underlying two year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving.  The much stronger than expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom-line resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021.  For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.  Now, regarding second half margins, we are intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions.  In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27.  While public health conditions remain uncertain, we are projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56.  Now I will cover additional details of our results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial cost responding to COVID. This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.  We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales, compared to $275 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs including performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year, and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro.  We are planning to see a ramp up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related restrictions subside to support continued growth. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%.  Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million, or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity. We are pointing ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.  For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range. During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.14. This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier.  This reduction reflects accounting adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous acquisitions. This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance.  Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%. This rate included a larger than expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.  Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million, compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales, compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year.  Relative to our April guidance, FX rates positively impacted our second quarter EPS by a penny. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million, less capital spending of $69 million.  Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million.  In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85. In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program. We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range.  And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike. No, that's a good summary. If we would not have exceeded our Q2 sales expectations by as much as we did, you probably would have seen a different sequential trend from Q2 to Q3 as we continue to grow and recover through this pandemic. But we just succeeded Q2 so much that we do think we'll see some of that seasonality that Mike talked about and then, going back up to a more normalized level of sales when we get into the fourth quarter. I would just add to that, one of the things that happens when there is a greater awareness of structural heart disease and valvular disease is that more patients are just coming into the system. And many of those patients who have isolated aortic stenosis are great candidates for TAVR. But there are a lot of patients who come into the system who need surgery and it's one of the reasons why we expect that business to continue to grow. Well, it was a touch light, but keep in mind there are a couple of moving pieces. One was, we had about 180 basis point hit from foreign exchange, primarily due to these hedge contracts where they are downsides and it works opposite of the benefit that we get with the translation of sales from outside of the U.S. But that was more than slumped by 230 basis points from manufacturing efficiencies and lower special COVID expenses than what we had in the second quarter. So, you got FX and manufacturing efficiencies at play and we came in 10 basis points short at the bottom end of our range for the full year gross margin guidance. As we are probably, right now, looking at something that is closer to the lower end of the 76% to 77% range. But it's probably too early to get more granular than that Robby. Sure. Sure. So it was accounting adjustments that were associated with some lower expectations in making future milestone payments connected to some past acquisitions that we've done. So, the accounting associated with those is, we evaluate the probabilities and the timing and the assumptions around whether we might make those milestone payments and in this case, we think there is some lower likelihood of some of those. And so, we run it through as a non \u2013 or as a GAAP gain, but not something that shows up in our non-GAAP earnings per share. Well, there are two primarily deals where we have earn outs. One is, Valtech, which is the parent company of the CARDIOMAN product and the other is Harpoon. And we'll get into the details beyond that. But those are the two big deals where you've got exposure to future milestones and where the expectations for those move up and move down over time and we run those accounting results through the P&L. You are talking about clinical trials? And I'll add to that, Pito, although things definitely picked up in Q2 in terms of clinical trial activities, it could go even faster in the future and so that's what we anticipate."

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. \u201cWe were encouraged by the clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. Vaccine adoption in key regions have contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment. At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day.  We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients. Last year, we noted that we're in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter. Hey, thanks, Scott. So, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2021. To serve the many patients suffering from Structural Heart Disease, we never stopped investing in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity.  As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity. Our foundation of leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued success.  And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Bob. And, we were pleased with the results. They were broad based. Your observation is correct. We really haven't talked about this much in the past. Most of our data historically have come from talking to our heart teams really around the world, but especially in the U.S. And when we talk to them, they really don't note a difference in their backlogs, compared to what they've seen in the past.  But we believe based on a number of sources, some of anecdotal conversations, some of it what's going on with other companies like insurers or others in the healthcare space that noted much more patient activity. And we believe that this flow of patients, so patients visiting their primary care physicians.  Patients going back to their general cardiologist, their general cardiologist referring them on a heart team, all of the things that we think were potentially delayed that there was a real pick up in the second quarter and because of the rate of treatment being much larger than anything we've ever seen in our path, we believe that that's in there.  It's not based on, we only have heart data, Bob, to quantify how much of that was, but we believe that that was a key part of what happened. Yes. I mean, you've got it right and I'll invite Scott to come in and add more color to it. But you are right, we did exit with momentum and it was strong momentum coming out of Q2. But at the same time, we are mindful of the fact that we probably got some help in Q2 from some of these patients coming off the sideline. Also, all of us are all acutely aware of what's going on with the pandemic and the recent surge that's happening and although that hasn't had dramatic impact on the healthcare system so far, we think it can have impact. And so, that's also baked into our thinking.  Q3, we think there is going to be a pronounced seasonality associated with people both in the healthcare system and patients themselves wanting to get away and take a vacation. And so, all those went into our thinking. And I don't know, Scott if there is much to add to that, but. Yes. Thanks, Vijay. One of the things you have to be a little bit careful of when you look at growth rates and use that as a way of measuring Q2 is to be a little bit more reflective on what the climate was like in Q2 of last year. So, Japan just didn't declined as much as the U.S. and Europe last year. And so, while the growth rate looks like less in Japan or it looks like it was less of a performer actually, Japan was doing quite well and grew very nicely.  Similarly, Europe didn't get hit quite as hard in Q2 as the U.S. did \u2013 as the U.S. really got hit hard. So, Europe has actually been performing, we think at a pretty high level. Now having said that, you correctly note that, hey, you know, Japan is in a near lockdown in portions or regions.  There is portions of Europe that are still troublesome, although there is encouraging signs in Europe as well. I just saw some data this morning that said vaccination rates in Europe are comparable to U.S. vaccination rates. And we know of some places where that are under pressure in the U.S. So, we've taken all that into account. We've provided our guidance. But when we look backward at Q2, we feel like we saw a strength across each of the regions. No, so, what we were commenting on was, the total market and we said that that total market, that's $1.8 billion will grow in the mid-single-digits through 2026. Now that total market is \u2013 this total, what we call Surgical Structural Heart, so it's not just valves. It has more than that in it. What we are trying to send the signal that we think that's still a growth market and that is with the TAVR impact. So, we think TAVR is definitely going to have impact on surgery during that period of time. But it's going to grow in spite of that. Okay. We've enjoyed some very nice growth for a number of reasons. A lot of it's built on just the strength of our premium RESILIA platform. So, clinical are a portion of it. But it's minor. I don't know the exact, Larry. But I would guess it's in the \u2013 maybe it's in the 10% range of overall sales. The market itself feels like the growth of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid did pick up in the quarter. And so, we see it. It's still a market that's driven by mitral more than tricuspid. So, I don't know if that's helpful. Yes, thanks, Larry. Yes, when we said $80 million at the beginning of the year that was about a doubling from last year. So, now we think it will more than double. But I think you know about how we feel about this market. We formed a business unit around it and have an awful lot of really important differentiated innovations going on in this space.  So, we have a high confidence level that this is going to be important. It's a road we are very focused on making sure that we have great outcomes and that's key to us. We work on having rigorous pivotal trials. We have differentiated therapies and we working on having great real world outcomes with our high touch model. We've said that we think it's going to be more than $3 billion by 2025. So it gives you a signal as to what we think where the market is maybe $1 billion in that neighborhood today. Yes, thanks. We feel like this quarter we saw broad growth across all size centers. And so, I think that's most noteworthy. Maybe even more than we have seen in the past real strength from some of the big centers. We continued to add centers this quarter. I would say, it was kind of a normal addition kind of what we've been adding right along. We are probably at an 800 plus level in terms of centers right now. And so, that's going to be probably a diminishing importance. But the ones that we are adding now are quite small centers and don't really have material impact to our results. Yes, so, we've got multiple pivotal underway right now. Five in TMTT and then we got other ones in TAVR and surgical and as we continue to enroll patients, those clinical trial expenses increase. Keep in mind, we incurred expenses at 2.1 at the point of treatment. But then secondly, we follow these patients lot of times out to ten years. And so, we got this increasing and recurring clinical expense that is part of our strategy. We are trying to build a robust body of clinical evidence and it's important part of how we are intending to grow the top-line over time. Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, I am sorry, if we weren't clear on that. I mean, we have been \u2013 I think pretty consistent since the new NCD was approved a few years that we thought this was going to head toward around 850 centers, that continues to be our belief. Nothing has really changed in that regard and it's probably constrained by the way that the NCD is written.  We probably argue that it might have been larger, but it is what it is. And so, that's where it is. But I really wouldn't focus overly on number of centers. For example, in the U.S., when you think about what the potential is for TAVR, because the real issue is patients coming off the sidelines.  There are many patients with severe AS that for one reason or another don't get diagnosed or don't ever make it to a hear team and treatment. And that is going to be the key to the \u2013 really the growth of TAVR overall. And we are fortunate to have a great procedure that has terrific results and we are making progress on encouraging patients to come back.  Now, it's a challenge, obviously with COVID, because those same patients that are vulnerable to COVID are those that are \u2013 have very similar characteristics of severe AS patients. But it's a real opportunity. And the other thing that we find is, there is much conversation about health disparities this day \u2013 these days. That's true in spades for sever aortic stenosis patients. There are real health disparities. And so, as the overall system looks to tackle that, we think that's a bit of a tailwind to our efforts. Yes, so, we are \u2013 that's always very difficult to measure at this point in time and that's one that you get a chance to look back on after everyone has reported and you get a chance to see the PBT registry. It's not truly our key focus. Most of our growth really comes from these patients coming into the system rather than any sort of changes in share. But as we say, we really think that those positions were stable in the quarter. Yes. No, it is a key part of our growth strategy. So, that's a correct observation. We have been involved in a lot of physician training. We have a high touch model. So we are there and we really help make sure that when people start up, they start up the right way. I think at this point, we are in double-digit countries, more than ten countries across Europe and are opening centers in all those places. And so, a significant increase to our team and of course, a lot of rigor in terms of trying to back that up. Yes. Thanks. I think, I think we talk about it every time that we are speaking to you that there is a really significant undertreatment in Japan, maybe at such a large elderly population that their treatment rates should be much higher and there are number of structural issues that span in the way of Japan getting that done and we try and become students of that and we are making some progress. Adding new centers is important and valuable. One of the things that I think may not be clear to most as we've only had a high surgical risk indication up until now. And so, we are going to jump to a low surgical risk indication. And once that reimbursement comes in place, which happens this quarter or we expect to happen this quarter. That's when there should be some real reaction from clinicians and in terms of treating these patients. So, we look forward to adding these new centers and \u2013 but we are also mindful of just COVID in Japan. So, it's one we are very positive about in the long-term. But a little uncertain in the short-term. So, longer term, we do think we are going to continue to get some benefits from scale and we think about margins, I guess, in all three areas, gross margin, R&D, SG&A. On the gross margin line, you've seen us expand gross margins. And even as we have invested a lot into our physical footprint of production facilities around the world, we are getting more and more efficient as our volumes increase. And so that's going to continue to be helpful, I think. On the R&D side, we are going to continue to invest heavily. And that may not in the short-term be a source for additional leverage. But longer term we do think revenues are going to outpace operating expenses including SG&A where we are getting more benefits of scale in our administrative, some of our back-office functions can support a bigger business around the globe. And so, we think we've got opportunities to over time incrementally expand the operating margin. Yes. So, for us, China was in terms of \u2013 THV was a minor contributor to sales in the quarter. It actually did very nicely in Critical Care and Surgical Heart Valves. But we are still launching there. We've got a very deliberate and methodical approach that's aimed at having great patient outcomes. And so, we are going to be looking at this as a long-term opportunity or an intermediate to long-term opportunity then we are going to try and take it from that perspective. It doesn't help right now that \u2013 some of us can't travel to China. And so, those kind of things tend to be obstacles, but overall team that's out there executing. We think so. The risk of over simplifying, yes, indeed, we believe that during COVID, people were more fearful of COVID and entering the system with COVID than they were concerned about their AS in many cases. We even had some clinicians tell us, when patients are home and they are not very active, they may not even demonstrate some of the symptoms they might have if they were more active.  But we do hear that they are coming back now. It's been again, anecdotal. So, I am a little hesitant to say that we know exactly where that's coming from, Josh. So, for example, we had one physician at a leading that tells you things that the patients that are coming back now are sicker than they were before and that will show up in the numbers.  But again, totally anecdotal one all, but we've heard enough of this that we believe that their patients that are coming back into the system and we saw the kind of a surge in the second quarter. Yes. Thank you. We think there is a host of technologies that are still pretty early and we've been backers of some of these that could really help with the diagnosis of valvular disease. There is, it comes from many directions and we think as the world digitizes and there is more handheld devices, and there is more ability to bounce signals off the cloud, whether it's EKGs or stethoscopes or and handheld devices of all sort, especially that can listen to heart sounds that this is going to be enhanced. I'll avoid doing a commercial for any particular companies, but there are numbers that are pursuing this exact thing and we think it's a very helpful sort of megatrend for us. Sure. Yes. Thanks. Well, I am sure that everybody, Anthony, gets a chance to track what's going on with the various companies that are engaged in TAVR. In general, in Europe, there is a pretty full complement of competitors. It seems there was that the two leading companies probably account to close to 85% of the volume in Europe.  So it gives you a bit of a sense, I don't know if that's exactly helpful for what you are looking for. Was there more, let's see, that's $7 billion opportunity, you are right. It has very little asymptomatic in it. We have a big early TAVR trial that's going on right now. And you also heard that we initiated a trial of patients with moderate AS. Those are not in that number. So, I tried to cover it in our general remarks.  The $7 billion in 2025, we don't see as sort of at the top of some curve. This has the potential to grow significantly more, particularly if we can demonstrate the value of TAVR for these patients that today have \u2013 or not really indicated and we think these trials have the potential to do that. Yes. We don't have great visibility as to when we are going to see data. Certainly, we are going to see it sometime next year. But I am not sure what medium we are going to see that. It's too early for us to be able to judge it. But what we think from a timing perspective is that, we should have that approval by the end of next year, which means we are probably launching and then you could see it in the numbers in 2023. Yes. Thanks, Joanne. So, obviously, we have learned a lot from those experiences and as we mentioned, we have a high touch model. So we are in every case. So, we get the chance to learn about that on a regular basis. We are highly focused not necessarily on just trying to drive sales, but to make sure that we get great results and we've been really pleased so far that we've had differentiated outcomes. And that's base to focus, because we are in this for the long run. We know that these patients today could be served better and we are striving to do exactly that. Sure. And again, Dan, we are trying to share with you our best thinking on what we believe. We believe that this occurred upstream, part of what was driving our comments in the past and you are exactly right. We've said, hey, AS patients don't score very well and we think that's true. But remember, we said there were 10,000 patients treated in \u2013 I mean, 20,000 patients treated in Q2 and 30,000 this Q2. So, big difference and so, it's that \u2013 so, all those 10,000 patients all come. It doesn't take very many to move numbers like they moved in Q2. So, we believe that it's patients across all risk levels. Even I think, people sometimes don't understand the low risk patients are quite old in many cases. And so, it's not just simply the newer indication. It's broadly that these patients that were elderly and had risk of COVID were hesitant to enter the system. We believe that they are more likely when signs of optimism really reaches a peak in the second quarter to reenter the system and be treated. And that we got some lift out of that. But we don't have perfect visibility on that. So, I can't be more quantitative. Yes. Yes. Thanks. You know what, we don't share the details of exactly where we are on that. But we do feel like we have a fair amount of visibility into the pipeline. We've been progressing really well, feel like we are on track to have our enrollment in place and to be able to make our submissions, so that we could have an end of year next year approval. Yes. Chris, that's a good observation. Yes, we are concerned about that. Especially those studies where rehospitalization or hospitalization is measured as an indicator in both the controlled group and the test group, those things can definitely get affected by, during a moment like a COVID outbreak. So, it is of concern. It's very much on FDA's radar screen and I am sure all companies that do trials that have those sort of end play.  Our PIs are all about it. And then, the good news is, between our principal investigators and the FDA people are cognizant of it and are working together to try and deal with those variabilities. Yes. I mean, what happens is, to get really discrete and go country-by-country might be misleading, because we would get into countries that are pretty small, but might not make a difference. We tend to look at it in terms of the U.S. in total, Europe in total, Japan, as a region and then the rest of the world.  When we look at each of those discretely, even though each one has its hotspots. So, for example, you know very well where those hotspots are in the U.S. The places that are vulnerable to low growth. But the U.S. in total, looks quite positive. The same thing in Europe. There are countries, some of the Nordic countries, we can \u2013 I can go on to greater level of specifics that are struggling more.  But overall, Europe is doing pretty well. They performed at a high level in the second quarter. Japan, in a lockdown, but then at the same time they have the approval for low risk and we have optimism about the future.  So, each of these is positive. But even the rest of the world has put very nice growth. So, we don't have a hotspot that probably affects a major region. More of those are going to be smaller in their nature, if that makes sense, Matt. Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2021 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are included in today's press release.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem : Thank you, Mark. As we anniversary our one-year impact of the pandemic on our financial results, I'd like to briefly reflect on the current environment and to discuss our 2021 and longer-term priorities as a company. I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our patients, employees in the community. Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due to COVID disruptions. One year later after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. Our sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines. Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global healthcare system, based on the environment as we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook.\nScott Ullem: Thanks, Mike. Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position, and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year. While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. And based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07 to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20. So now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $331 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro, and personnel-related costs, partially offset by reduced travel spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate our spending will increase during the year as travel restrictions subside and we resume a more normalized operating environment. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, similar to pre-COVID levels. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%. This rate included a 290 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted our first quarter EPS by about $0.01. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $301 million, less capital spending of $106 million. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, 2021. We repurchased 3.6 million shares for $303 million during the first quarter and have approximately $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to execute our strategy of offsetting dilution from incentive stock compensation as well as opportunistically reducing our shares outstanding over time. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter were 631 million, down approximately 1 million from the prior quarter. We continue to expect average shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million. So with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.\nMike Mussallem : Thanks, Scott. We remain confident in our long-term patient-focused strategy and our innovation pipeline. To serve the many patients separate from structural heart disease, we have never stopped investing in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity. As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and in a position to help more patients than ever as the world fully emerges from this pandemic. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Mike. So Diego, with that, we're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nBob Hopkins: Oh, great. Thank you and good afternoon. One thing that I'd love to get your view on is that it kind of stood out in the quarter is the TAVR growth rate you guys put up in the first quarter outside the United States and especially outside the United States and excluding Europe, given some of the numbers you gave us. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And specifically, was Japan and maybe China really strong in the quarter, Mike? Just love your take on what happened outside the U.S. this quarter with TAVR.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thank, Bob., That's a correct observation. Clearly, OUS did pull our performance up in the quarter. And even though Europe grew nicely, most of this came from Japan and other countries. And so Japan was pretty significant in size. And so it really was a meaningful contributor to growth. But it certainly wasn't alone. You could go across many other countries, it\u2019s sort of that normally don\u2019t get called out like the Australias or the Koreas and these kind of places in the world where it\u2019s underpenetrated. And we just don\u2019t have TAVR rates where they should be at. We\u2019re really strong growers. Some of that may have been that they were impacted earlier by the pandemic. And so the year-over-year comparisons are a bit stronger. But frankly, the numbers were just up. We continue to see that therapy grow in those areas. China, we're very early in that game. It was not a meaningful contributor to those results, so it's really not a factor.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. I mean one quick follow-up on that is just, was there anything in particular that you think that gave you better results in Japan this quarter? And then on Europe, I'm just curious, did Europe get worse over the course of the quarter, just following what happened with COVID? Or was it pretty stable? Or did it improve like the U.S.? Just curious on that.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So in Japan, there was no specific thing that drove this. We've been focused in Japan for many years, and actually, somewhat disappointed that adoption rates haven't been higher. And so this has been a long-term and consistent effort, and it's really nice to just continue to see the adoption. We are glad to see this approval for low-risk in Japan that will start having some meaning later on in the year. In Europe, it was interesting. It was kind of choppy, I would say, not consistent across all countries. We still saw the countries that were less penetrated, probably have a little bit more growth in those countries that have traditionally been strong. And if you looked at it through the course of the quarter, it exited pretty solid, I think, similar to the overall growth rate of the quarter. So I don't think there was anything notable there, Bob.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe the opposite of Bob's question in the U.S., it'd be great to get a sense of sort of the trends you're seeing, how the quarter went and especially with so many of the adults, particularly the 65 and older population now fully vaccinated. Are you starting to see trends improve there? And then maybe I'll just ask a second question upfront. I've heard from a lot of doctors throughout the COVID time that the time from diagnosis to screening to treatment with TAVR is starting to compress. I want to see if you're seeing that on a company level, and if so, is that a durable trend? Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. So let's talk about the U.S. The U.S. did improve during the course of the quarter, no doubt about it, but we would call it choppy. It wasn't straight up. So for example, things were tough in January and February, and clearly got better in March. Although when you got toward the back end of March and you had spring break, you felt that effect as well. But clearly, an upward trend. I just remember the sort of the roller coaster that we went on, Robbie, when we first put out the TAVR estimates of 15% to 20% growth in our December investor conference, we were feeling pretty good about it. When we got to the end of January and reported Q1, we were saying, well, we're still in that range, but probably we're a little lower in that range just based on things we're going. And then here, they went and recovered nicely. So we feel confident about the 15% to 20% range going forward. So hopefully, that helps you get a sense for the U.S. In terms of the question about, is it easier? All hospitals are not identical in the way that they screen patients. And so although some are more efficient and getting more efficient, others are more challenging. And one of the things that happens when you have COVID, so in addition to all the tests that you run through, you also have to do COVID tests before you would come into the hospital. So it just becomes a hassle for these patients in addition to just the fear factor. So I wouldn't say it's uniform. Overall, hospitals will get a little better, but it's still a battle. The good news is length of stay is coming down. Hospitals are clearly improving in that regard. And maybe some of that is COVID driven, but it seems to be a trend as well.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and I had two. Maybe I'll start with the first on the guidance here. Mike, on your comments on 15% to 20%, in January, you felt perhaps low end seems more appropriate. You just beat Q1 at the high end, it looks like procedures have come back. So I'm thinking, are we -- should we be looking at the high end of the guide? And I think that 15% to 20%, just to put a finer point that, that's versus last year's guide, right? If you look at the actual TAVR revenue numbers, I mean, this is more like a 16% to 26% growth off of actual fiscal 2020 TAVR numbers?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. No. Thanks, Vijay. We feel pretty good about the fact that we're putting pretty specific guidance out there in the first place. And guidance is not that simple during the age of COVID. We did \u2013 we do feel better about it. We probably would tend to guide people more towards the middle of the range, Vijay. Of course, it's possible for it to be higher and lower. And this is going to be somewhat dependent on what your perspective is about COVID. So even in the U.S. or certainly across Europe, if COVID is more challenging, it will put pressure on our numbers. If things go -- vaccinations go nicely and COVID really, we start winning the battle, it helps us trend towards the higher end. But I feel like there's pretty balance in the guidance that we tried to advance.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then I did have one, perhaps more a bigger picture question, Mike. I guess the question we've gotten is, how derisked is mitral? Because if I had to make a thesis, mitral is going to be a really big TAM, much bigger than TAVR. I guess the question was, look, you've had COAPT versus MITRA-FR, patient selection matters. Then when I look at your trials, you have two different trials on the replacement side, SAPIEN M3 and the EVOQUE. Is that a two-valve strategy? Is that perhaps Edwards trying to take a portfolio approach? Are these valves different? Or I guess I'm trying to ask how derisked is mitral? Are we at a point where we know exactly what patients we need to select and this is just a question of time before mitral ends up being much larger than TAVR?\nMike Mussallem: Thanks for that, Vijay. Well, you can probably get a sense in terms of how dedicated Edwards is to pursue transcatheter mitral in tricuspid. We really think it's a big opportunity. We think it's within our reach, and we think the time is right for us to go after it and we're going after it with a lot of energy. You know we're pursuing it with a toolbox. To say it's derisked, would be overstating the situation at this point. It certainly is not derisked. There's leaflet therapy out there right now that has a fair amount of data around it, but there is still limited data on replacement, limited data in tricuspid. And I think each time you see results from these trials, and you see them actually in human use, you start to see more and more derisking and more and more clarity and frankly, more clarity on which patients are appropriate for which therapies. And I would say that's not fully known at this point. We have some pretty good ideas. And maybe we know more than most because we have so many technologies advancing in this space, but there's still more to learn. And so I'll turn your attention mostly to these big clinical meetings where there'll be reporting the results from mitral and tricuspid trials to get a sense for us getting a better understanding of the opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Mike, one on early TAVR, one on TMTT. Just on early TAVR, just a clarification, Mike, I thought I heard you say earlier that you expect to complete the trial in 2021. Maybe that's just enrollment, but the clinicaltrials.gov was just updated in April, it says the primary endpoint will be reached in December 2021. So my question is, can you just tell us kind of what the status is on enrollment and when we could expect to see a data readout there? And I have one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Sorry, if there was a lack of clarity on it. What I meant to infer is we're striving to achieve enrollment completion by the end of 2021. You may have also gotten from my comments that enrollment was a little lighter than we like in Q1, and that anticipates actually that we're going to have increased enrollment as the year goes on and COVID gets a little bit more under control. So we're working hard to get there. Remember that there's a 2-year endpoint on this trial as well.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful, Mike. On TMTT can you talk a little bit more? You seem to be getting traction -- nice traction there, a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mitral and tricuspid business is there. I don't know if you're willing to kind of split out mitral and versus tricuspid. But any color you're willing to provide would be helpful.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, Larry. Yes, at this point, clearly, there's more sales in mitral than there is in tricuspid. Tricuspid is pretty new, still -- I mean, it's been a pretty impressive ramp in tricuspid. We're pleased with what we're seeing. We think the opportunity is a nice one, but still, the opportunity is at least the sales right now, is to a great majority related to mitral. There's still more centers that are doing this. And so for Edwards, actually activating sites is important, very careful training, trying to make sure that we get great outcomes. Those are all critical success factors. But I don't know if that helps answer your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: It does.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: And congratulations on the strong start to the year. I have two questions on TAVR. The first one, just on low-risk bicuspid, the PARTNER 3 bicuspid registry data has been made public. And just wanted to get a sense of -- from you, if your team is relaying the penetration of TAVR into the low-risk bicuspid opportunity, where it sits and with the registry data on hand now? And where can that go? And the follow-up question is just thinking about the replacement cycle for TAVR, I know it's still very early, but as younger patients are getting implanted with TAVR and the TAVR opportunity out in the out years, maybe even past 2024. But Mike, do you mind just framing of what needs to be done clinically to bring TAVR and SAVR into a place maybe where TAVR and SAVR sits today?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, Josh. So let me take a shot at this. So overall, we're pleased with our bicuspid data. I don't have anything specific breakout to share with you. We routinely treat a lot of bicuspid patients. And I think what will be interesting is what we mentioned in this upcoming meeting, I believe it's EuroPCR. You're going to see a report of a pretty significant registry of patients that are bicuspid patients that have been treated with transcatheter technology. So that should be an interesting data point and help give you some good insight. That's just here within the next couple of months. In terms of where we are in the journey for TAVR -- in TAVR versus TAVR and SAVR, you hear clinicians talking much more about how do I plan a lifetime therapy, right? What should be for a given patient, given their age, given their disease, what should be the first treatment? What might be the second? Should it be surgery first, TAVR second, SAVR first, then surgery, then another TAVR and all that. And that's a very active discussion. I think there's been some really strong evidence that says TAVR and TAVR is good, as well as TAVR in SAVR. So those are both proven to be realistic options. And so now it's trying to sort through for any given patient what's the best therapy. And it's on the podium pretty regularly, and I think we're on a pretty steep learning curve in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: I guess I wanted to start off with TMTT again and just really, as you're expanding in Europe and you think about the $80 million in 2021, really what's coming from kind of further account penetration versus account expansion as you factor that into your guidance?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks, Cecilia. The short answer is, I'm not sure. Clearly, more sites is an important component here. I also know that there's an increase within the existing sites. But probably site expansion is the biggest part of that, if you were to just have to pick one versus the other, given the outcomes.\nCecilia Furlong: Okay. Great. And I guess I did want to turn back to TAVR in Japan and just what you're seeing there. Really just ahead of low-risk reimbursement, if that has changed dynamics in terms of just interest versus kind of what you've seen historically and that being kind of a driver of recent strength?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, Cecilia. Yes, we believe that clinicians and the environment in general is pretty disciplined in Japan and that clinicians do treat to approved guidelines. And so we don't think that there's a lot of low risk that's in the current numbers. And so we expect that to be a positive boost.  Having said that, as we've talked about before, treatment rates in Japan compared to where they should be are just low. There's almost as many elderly in Japan as there are in the United States but it's still dramatically less treated. So we still have work to do. There's still potentially a lot of upside there. We're pleased to see the growth rates, but we're not pleased at the penetration rates yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: So I'm hoping, Mike, you could shed some light on just a couple of dynamics that we get questions about often and how they potentially affecting the growth of the TAVR business globally and maybe especially in the U.S. So these two things, and I'll keep it to one question are first, the idea that TAVR somehow benefited during COVID, this idea of a preference for TAVR or SAVR, driven by length of stay and that potentially maybe that rolled back towards SAVR over time somewhat? And then the second is sort of what you've contemplated in terms of -- you gained an awful lot of share -- a fair amount of share from your largest competitor over the past 1.5 years or so. And how much you contemplated sort of having to feed that back and maybe what you've seen on that front so far as it compares to what you've assumed?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Well, thanks Matt. So a couple of things. I mean clearly, we've heard clinicians and hospitals talk a lot about their focus on length of stay and about how helpful it is if they don't have to utilize their ICU or have patients that stay in the hospital.  Having said that, I would say that if you were to take the U.S. mix, for example, of TAVR versus SAVR during the pandemic, that's remained relatively flat. There really we haven't seen TAVR versus SAVR or vice versa advantage very much during the pandemic. It's been pretty stable. And so it's difficult to know if that's COVID related or if it's just a sign of the times, but that's the observation. You also asked -- you also -- the second part of the question was about share. Yes, we feel pretty good about our competitive position. We're really pleased with the performance of SAPIEN 3 Ultra, it's demonstrated not only to be easy to use, but low complication rates and its length of stay has been remarkable, and people have really been able to count on it during the pandemic. I don't know anything that's going to change that. We continue to be aggressive innovators and we'll continue to advance the state-of-the-art. But we've gotten a lot of positive feedback from clinicians.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: And nice quarter. Is there a way to quantify backlog of patients that have cut off a procedure during COVID-19?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Joanne, it's a tough one. We do think about that a lot. In general, we don't think that there's a significant backlog of patients. Clearly, it's variable across centers. There might be some centers actually that have some, but we don't think that, that's significant. More of what we found during the pandemic is that at the same time, when centers have a capacity problem and it impacts their implants, it also tends to impact their screening. So you don't necessarily get this backlog built up. They tend to move more or less in parallel. So it's not one that tends to drive a big backlog.\nJoanne Wuensch: And as a follow-up question, I'm sort of curious what you're sort of seeing in terms of the clinical trials. It sounds as if you've restarted many of them, are they back to what I would call sort of normalized run rate in terms of enrollment?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, Joanne. Yes, we never officially stopped any clinical trials. They were clearly slower in the first quarter. And so that was a factor. Actually, interestingly enough, the CLASP IID trial actually enrolled pretty nicely in the second quarter. So it wasn't uniform. But I'd say most of our trials were impacted. We're -- we think that the clinicians that we're working with, they're eager to get back at it. To say we're back at pre-COVID rates, I think would be an overstatement. But I think we should start building back up again. And as we mentioned, I think the regulators have been pretty good thought partners in this as we try and really react to what COVID has done to clinical trials.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: Mike, I have one TAVR question and one PASCAL question for you. First, on TAVR in Japan, so you've talked a lot about how Japan has sort of -- I don't know, has underperformed your internal expectations, is the right way to think about it. But what is going on there? And what is -- like what's going to change the tide in a meaningful way in Japan? And then again, just one quick follow-up on that.\nMike Mussallem: Danielle, it's multifaceted in Japan in terms of what's going on. We think there needs to be more centers in Japan, amongst other things because in many cases, patients like to stay within their own region to get treated, and we don't have TAVR centers in all regions. There still is some pretty high requirement for TAVR centers to begin in Japan. They actually have to be cleared by an external panel. And so it's not just between us and the clinicians. And we're hoping that low-risk, it has the possibility of being a catalyst to be able to help along the way and maybe simplify this journey for clinicians and patients.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. That's helpful. And then on PASCAL, big catalyst potentially coming next year with the late 2022 U.S. launch, what can you talk about as far as learnings in Europe as you're opening new centers? I mean has your progress in Europe -- I appreciate COVID has had an impact here, but has your progress in Europe given you sort of a blueprint for what you might -- how you might approach the U.S.? Maybe talk a little bit about that, if you could?\nMike Mussallem: Sure. Yes, you're right, Danielle. Naturally, we're learning quite a bit in Europe, as you might imagine. What we stay focused on, and I think we've been pretty vocal about this, is trying to maintain a really, I'll call it, a high-touch model. So we stay very close to clinicians, try and help make sure that they have terrific outcomes, that they're very well trained and that they get incredible results. And we think we can't do anything more important than that to really drive the adoption of the therapy on a long-term basis. We're optimistic about the U.S. It's very large. Even though things have been -- we've had nice growth in Europe. The pandemic doesn't make it easy. You can imagine the biggest user of this technology is Germany; and when Germany goes through tough times, it doesn't make it so easy. So we're a bit dependent on this. But we're going to apply much of the same strategy in the U.S. that we apply it in Europe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Congratulations, strong start to the year. I'll have two questions on -- I'll ask upfront. The first would be on early TAVR for asymptomatic patients. Just wondering to get -- if you could provide some high-level comments on sort of the latest view on the asymptomatic opportunity. And then once we sort of get there in the next year or so with data, how influential the findings from the study will be at opening up asymptomatic. And then on existing U.S. centers, maybe just a refresh on where the average TAVR volumes are today. And when you think about fewer hospital end days, how significant of a driver could that be to average utilization, that average utilization number?\nMike Mussallem: So let me start with the asymptomatic trial, the early TAVR trial. We think this is a really important trial One of the obstacles for patients to be treated is they can have severe aortic stenosis. And if there's uncertainty whether they have symptoms, then they're not treated because that's what guidelines say that assessing and identifying symptoms is a very sketchy game. It's subject to a lot of misinterpretation. So if we took that requirement out of the equation, we think it would be very meaningful. And if you could simply take some echo measurements and say, \"Hey, this patient has severe aortic stenosis and that drives treatment.\" That simplifies the diagnosis dramatically. It would make a big difference. So we think that's important. The second question, I didn't fully understand. Do you mind, Anthony, saying it again?\nAnthony Petrone: Sure. When you look at the average U.S. volumes in U.S. TAVR centers today, is there a number where average utilization is just in terms of monthly surgical volumes? When you think of fewer hospital end days as a driver, does that have the potential to move that average utilization number higher?\nMike Mussallem: Okay. So we've seen new hospitals come into the system, and that's been -- that's helped with growth. We feel like hospitals have the ability to add capacity if that's really underlying your question and that they do that quite well. They can do it by adding days. They can do it by adding clinicians. And we found them routinely able to do it and not really be a big burden to them. And so it is clearly helpful when the length of stay is shorter but some of it is their own practices. If they're able to do, for example, multiple TAVRs in a day, that really helps if they're able to discharge patient faster, that helps. And all those are improving. And also, I would just say generally, their desire to be able to increase capacity. So it's -- we're getting to a place where TAVR is becoming far more predictable than it had been in the past, and that really helps hospitals' ability to plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.\nAdam Maeder: Maybe just sticking with the capacity theme. I wanted to ask about new U.S. TAVR centers and kind of where we are today. I think there was a lot of optimism in 2019 with the new NCD that would span a couple of hundred new TAVR centers, COVID-19 has obviously been impactful. But just wondering if we're starting to see some green shoots again and new centers open up? Or are we just not quite there yet? And then I have a follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Adam, I hope your follow-up is for Scott Ullem. He's getting lonely over here without any questions. But let me get to your question. Yes, we're probably approaching something around 800 centers in the U.S. It's interesting even during the pandemic, there's been an increase each quarter, maybe 10 to 20 centers per quarter. And so it's gradually increased. We've been impressed that centers have actually come online during the pandemic, who tells you about their desire to be able to bring the TAVR treatment to these structural heart patients. So we've been doing nicely. I think at the time of the NCD, we thought the number might go to 850. We really don't have any update on that at this point. So maybe that gives you a sense of where we are.\nAdam Maeder: That's really helpful, Mike. And apologies to Scott, but one follow-up on the TAVR side of things in the pipeline. Just -- it's been a little bit of time here, I think, since we've gotten an update on the SAPIEN X4 program. So just wondering if there's any new developments you can share there? And is that something you still plan? I think you're planning to move that to a pivotal trial at some point in '21. So is that still the case? And just when will we learn more about the feature set and product design?\nMike Mussallem: Yes, at this point, Adam, we're not prepared to share more about the feature set of the product line. We are still expecting to begin the clinical trial in 2021. And I think maybe even from a bigger picture perspective, although we're really pleased with where we are on TAVR, we're just not going to stop innovating. We continue to find opportunities for us to improve this therapy and make it better for patients and we're just going to stay relentless in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor: Maybe I'll try to get Scott involved. I guess I'm just wondering, with -- slightly, but you had better-than-expected growth across the product lines in Q1, and you basically raised guidance by the beat for the year. But I'm just curious, at least from a high-level standpoint, are you feeling better about the year now that you have one card turned over here, one quarter under the belt? And why not raise guidance more? Is that out of an abundance of caution? Or have things gotten worse to the point where you don't feel comfortable doing that yet?\nScott Ullem: Well, look, we're pleased with what happened in the first quarter, both in terms of sales and how much of that fell right through to the bottom line. But just to take you back, remember at our investor conference in December, where we laid out guidance for all of 2021, we said it was assuming 3 things. And that was that we get through the winter months that vaccinations get widely administered and that hospitals remain open. And when we got to January, in our earnings call in late January, it felt pretty bad. I mean we felt like things would probably on the margin gotten worse, not better since our investor conference. But here we are now having seen the results of the first quarter and we're feeling positive and still confident about the guidance that we laid out originally in December. We think it's going to be choppy. It has been choppy in the first quarter, although there's certainly signs of strength, and it's the reason why we still feel confident in the guidance that we've laid out for the second quarter and reiterating the guidance for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: One for Mike, one for Scott. First one for Mike. As the world begins to recover post-COVID, I'm curious if you're seeing any changes with any referral channels you talked about, smaller centers outperforming larger centers. Have you seen local docs help drive increased diagnosis of patients within their markets?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Pito, I think it's not fair to say that we've really seen meaningful changes in the referral centers. One of the things we have seen though is -- and then we just hear this anecdotally that patients maybe are less likely to travel long distances to a center of excellence, and they're more likely to want to stay local to their centers. And so that's probably been in there to some extent, probably driven some of the behavior during the pandemic.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. And then for Scott, I get the cost will increase as travel and conferences begin to pick up again as revenues begin to recovery here. But if you can quantify how much travel conferences will generally impact expenses throughout the year?\nScott Ullem: Yes. We're not going to break down travel versus the other expenses, but now there are a couple of different drivers of our expectation that expenses increase. One is just actual travel and people out in the field; two is more training, more time going in person to society meetings to the extent that those start coming more in person. And then, of course, on the clinical trials, and we're expecting that clinical trial enrollment will continue to increase. That's a number that shows up in our research and development expense line item on our income statement. So those are at least some of the pieces that will be influencing our overall expense ramp in the rest of 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: No one's asked about the strength in Surgical. And I realize there's a comp dynamic, but I can't remember last time Surgical grew faster than TAVR. So just a couple of questions on that. Can we assume most of the strength was from international markets? Were there any stocking orders that impacted growth? And you also mentioned growth was helped by premium products. Any way to parse out procedure growth versus dollar growth?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So a few things. One is, you're right. Surgical rates dropped pretty precipitously in late March. So some of that is a comparable. So that should go into account. But actually, the U.S. was quite strong. It certainly was comparable, if not slightly stronger than the global rates. And so I think it certainly was broad globally, but the U.S. was good. And I don't know if that ended up answering the question.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks all very much for your continued interest in Edwards. And Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. Back to you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position, and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year. While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. And based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07 to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20. So now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $331 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro, and personnel-related costs, partially offset by reduced travel spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate our spending will increase during the year as travel restrictions subside and we resume a more normalized operating environment. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, similar to pre-COVID levels. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%. This rate included a 290 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted our first quarter EPS by about $0.01. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $301 million, less capital spending of $106 million. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, 2021. We repurchased 3.6 million shares for $303 million during the first quarter and have approximately $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to execute our strategy of offsetting dilution from incentive stock compensation as well as opportunistically reducing our shares outstanding over time. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter were 631 million, down approximately 1 million from the prior quarter. We continue to expect average shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million. So with that, I'll pass it back to Mike. Well, look, we're pleased with what happened in the first quarter, both in terms of sales and how much of that fell right through to the bottom line. But just to take you back, remember at our investor conference in December, where we laid out guidance for all of 2021, we said it was assuming 3 things. And that was that we get through the winter months that vaccinations get widely administered and that hospitals remain open. And when we got to January, in our earnings call in late January, it felt pretty bad. I mean we felt like things would probably on the margin gotten worse, not better since our investor conference. But here we are now having seen the results of the first quarter and we're feeling positive and still confident about the guidance that we laid out originally in December. We think it's going to be choppy. It has been choppy in the first quarter, although there's certainly signs of strength, and it's the reason why we still feel confident in the guidance that we've laid out for the second quarter and reiterating the guidance for the full year.

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As we anniversary our one-year impact of the pandemic on our financial results, I'd like to briefly reflect on the current environment and to discuss our 2021 and longer-term priorities as a company. I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our patients, employees in the community. Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due to COVID disruptions. One year later after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. Our sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines. Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global healthcare system, based on the environment as we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook. Thanks, Scott. We remain confident in our long-term patient-focused strategy and our innovation pipeline. To serve the many patients separate from structural heart disease, we have never stopped investing in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity. As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and in a position to help more patients than ever as the world fully emerges from this pandemic. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Yes. Thank, Bob., That's a correct observation. Clearly, OUS did pull our performance up in the quarter. And even though Europe grew nicely, most of this came from Japan and other countries. And so Japan was pretty significant in size. And so it really was a meaningful contributor to growth. But it certainly wasn't alone. You could go across many other countries, it's sort of that normally don't get called out like the Australias or the Koreas and these kind of places in the world where it's underpenetrated. And we just don't have TAVR rates where they should be at. We're really strong growers. Some of that may have been that they were impacted earlier by the pandemic. And so the year-over-year comparisons are a bit stronger. But frankly, the numbers were just up. We continue to see that therapy grow in those areas. China, we're very early in that game. It was not a meaningful contributor to those results, so it's really not a factor. Yes. So in Japan, there was no specific thing that drove this. We've been focused in Japan for many years, and actually, somewhat disappointed that adoption rates haven't been higher. And so this has been a long-term and consistent effort, and it's really nice to just continue to see the adoption. We are glad to see this approval for low-risk in Japan that will start having some meaning later on in the year. In Europe, it was interesting. It was kind of choppy, I would say, not consistent across all countries. We still saw the countries that were less penetrated, probably have a little bit more growth in those countries that have traditionally been strong. And if you looked at it through the course of the quarter, it exited pretty solid, I think, similar to the overall growth rate of the quarter. So I don't think there was anything notable there, Bob. Okay. So let's talk about the U.S. The U.S. did improve during the course of the quarter, no doubt about it, but we would call it choppy. It wasn't straight up. So for example, things were tough in January and February, and clearly got better in March. Although when you got toward the back end of March and you had spring break, you felt that effect as well. But clearly, an upward trend. I just remember the sort of the roller coaster that we went on, Robbie, when we first put out the TAVR estimates of 15% to 20% growth in our December investor conference, we were feeling pretty good about it. When we got to the end of January and reported Q1, we were saying, well, we're still in that range, but probably we're a little lower in that range just based on things we're going. And then here, they went and recovered nicely. So we feel confident about the 15% to 20% range going forward. So hopefully, that helps you get a sense for the U.S. In terms of the question about, is it easier? All hospitals are not identical in the way that they screen patients. And so although some are more efficient and getting more efficient, others are more challenging. And one of the things that happens when you have COVID, so in addition to all the tests that you run through, you also have to do COVID tests before you would come into the hospital. So it just becomes a hassle for these patients in addition to just the fear factor. So I wouldn't say it's uniform. Overall, hospitals will get a little better, but it's still a battle. The good news is length of stay is coming down. Hospitals are clearly improving in that regard. And maybe some of that is COVID driven, but it seems to be a trend as well. Yes. No. Thanks, Vijay. We feel pretty good about the fact that we're putting pretty specific guidance out there in the first place. And guidance is not that simple during the age of COVID. We did \u2013 we do feel better about it. We probably would tend to guide people more towards the middle of the range, Vijay. Of course, it's possible for it to be higher and lower. And this is going to be somewhat dependent on what your perspective is about COVID. So even in the U.S. or certainly across Europe, if COVID is more challenging, it will put pressure on our numbers. If things go -- vaccinations go nicely and COVID really, we start winning the battle, it helps us trend towards the higher end. But I feel like there's pretty balance in the guidance that we tried to advance. Thanks for that, Vijay. Well, you can probably get a sense in terms of how dedicated Edwards is to pursue transcatheter mitral in tricuspid. We really think it's a big opportunity. We think it's within our reach, and we think the time is right for us to go after it and we're going after it with a lot of energy. You know we're pursuing it with a toolbox. To say it's derisked, would be overstating the situation at this point. It certainly is not derisked. There's leaflet therapy out there right now that has a fair amount of data around it, but there is still limited data on replacement, limited data in tricuspid. And I think each time you see results from these trials, and you see them actually in human use, you start to see more and more derisking and more and more clarity and frankly, more clarity on which patients are appropriate for which therapies. And I would say that's not fully known at this point. We have some pretty good ideas. And maybe we know more than most because we have so many technologies advancing in this space, but there's still more to learn. And so I'll turn your attention mostly to these big clinical meetings where there'll be reporting the results from mitral and tricuspid trials to get a sense for us getting a better understanding of the opportunity. Yes. Sorry, if there was a lack of clarity on it. What I meant to infer is we're striving to achieve enrollment completion by the end of 2021. You may have also gotten from my comments that enrollment was a little lighter than we like in Q1, and that anticipates actually that we're going to have increased enrollment as the year goes on and COVID gets a little bit more under control. So we're working hard to get there. Remember that there's a 2-year endpoint on this trial as well. Yes, Larry. Yes, at this point, clearly, there's more sales in mitral than there is in tricuspid. Tricuspid is pretty new, still -- I mean, it's been a pretty impressive ramp in tricuspid. We're pleased with what we're seeing. We think the opportunity is a nice one, but still, the opportunity is at least the sales right now, is to a great majority related to mitral. There's still more centers that are doing this. And so for Edwards, actually activating sites is important, very careful training, trying to make sure that we get great outcomes. Those are all critical success factors. But I don't know if that helps answer your question. Yes, Josh. So let me take a shot at this. So overall, we're pleased with our bicuspid data. I don't have anything specific breakout to share with you. We routinely treat a lot of bicuspid patients. And I think what will be interesting is what we mentioned in this upcoming meeting, I believe it's EuroPCR. You're going to see a report of a pretty significant registry of patients that are bicuspid patients that have been treated with transcatheter technology. So that should be an interesting data point and help give you some good insight. That's just here within the next couple of months. In terms of where we are in the journey for TAVR -- in TAVR versus TAVR and SAVR, you hear clinicians talking much more about how do I plan a lifetime therapy, right? What should be for a given patient, given their age, given their disease, what should be the first treatment? What might be the second? Should it be surgery first, TAVR second, SAVR first, then surgery, then another TAVR and all that. And that's a very active discussion. I think there's been some really strong evidence that says TAVR and TAVR is good, as well as TAVR in SAVR. So those are both proven to be realistic options. And so now it's trying to sort through for any given patient what's the best therapy. And it's on the podium pretty regularly, and I think we're on a pretty steep learning curve in that regard. Yes, thanks, Cecilia. The short answer is, I'm not sure. Clearly, more sites is an important component here. I also know that there's an increase within the existing sites. But probably site expansion is the biggest part of that, if you were to just have to pick one versus the other, given the outcomes. Yes, Cecilia. Yes, we believe that clinicians and the environment in general is pretty disciplined in Japan and that clinicians do treat to approved guidelines. And so we don't think that there's a lot of low risk that's in the current numbers. And so we expect that to be a positive boost.  Having said that, as we've talked about before, treatment rates in Japan compared to where they should be are just low. There's almost as many elderly in Japan as there are in the United States but it's still dramatically less treated. So we still have work to do. There's still potentially a lot of upside there. We're pleased to see the growth rates, but we're not pleased at the penetration rates yet. Yes. Well, thanks Matt. So a couple of things. I mean clearly, we've heard clinicians and hospitals talk a lot about their focus on length of stay and about how helpful it is if they don't have to utilize their ICU or have patients that stay in the hospital.  Having said that, I would say that if you were to take the U.S. mix, for example, of TAVR versus SAVR during the pandemic, that's remained relatively flat. There really we haven't seen TAVR versus SAVR or vice versa advantage very much during the pandemic. It's been pretty stable. And so it's difficult to know if that's COVID related or if it's just a sign of the times, but that's the observation. You also asked -- you also -- the second part of the question was about share. Yes, we feel pretty good about our competitive position. We're really pleased with the performance of SAPIEN 3 Ultra, it's demonstrated not only to be easy to use, but low complication rates and its length of stay has been remarkable, and people have really been able to count on it during the pandemic. I don't know anything that's going to change that. We continue to be aggressive innovators and we'll continue to advance the state-of-the-art. But we've gotten a lot of positive feedback from clinicians. Yes. Thanks, Joanne, it's a tough one. We do think about that a lot. In general, we don't think that there's a significant backlog of patients. Clearly, it's variable across centers. There might be some centers actually that have some, but we don't think that, that's significant. More of what we found during the pandemic is that at the same time, when centers have a capacity problem and it impacts their implants, it also tends to impact their screening. So you don't necessarily get this backlog built up. They tend to move more or less in parallel. So it's not one that tends to drive a big backlog. Yes, Joanne. Yes, we never officially stopped any clinical trials. They were clearly slower in the first quarter. And so that was a factor. Actually, interestingly enough, the CLASP IID trial actually enrolled pretty nicely in the second quarter. So it wasn't uniform. But I'd say most of our trials were impacted. We're -- we think that the clinicians that we're working with, they're eager to get back at it. To say we're back at pre-COVID rates, I think would be an overstatement. But I think we should start building back up again. And as we mentioned, I think the regulators have been pretty good thought partners in this as we try and really react to what COVID has done to clinical trials. Danielle, it's multifaceted in Japan in terms of what's going on. We think there needs to be more centers in Japan, amongst other things because in many cases, patients like to stay within their own region to get treated, and we don't have TAVR centers in all regions. There still is some pretty high requirement for TAVR centers to begin in Japan. They actually have to be cleared by an external panel. And so it's not just between us and the clinicians. And we're hoping that low-risk, it has the possibility of being a catalyst to be able to help along the way and maybe simplify this journey for clinicians and patients. Sure. Yes, you're right, Danielle. Naturally, we're learning quite a bit in Europe, as you might imagine. What we stay focused on, and I think we've been pretty vocal about this, is trying to maintain a really, I'll call it, a high-touch model. So we stay very close to clinicians, try and help make sure that they have terrific outcomes, that they're very well trained and that they get incredible results. And we think we can't do anything more important than that to really drive the adoption of the therapy on a long-term basis. We're optimistic about the U.S. It's very large. Even though things have been -- we've had nice growth in Europe. The pandemic doesn't make it easy. You can imagine the biggest user of this technology is Germany; and when Germany goes through tough times, it doesn't make it so easy. So we're a bit dependent on this. But we're going to apply much of the same strategy in the U.S. that we apply it in Europe. So let me start with the asymptomatic trial, the early TAVR trial. We think this is a really important trial One of the obstacles for patients to be treated is they can have severe aortic stenosis. And if there's uncertainty whether they have symptoms, then they're not treated because that's what guidelines say that assessing and identifying symptoms is a very sketchy game. It's subject to a lot of misinterpretation. So if we took that requirement out of the equation, we think it would be very meaningful. And if you could simply take some echo measurements and say, \"Hey, this patient has severe aortic stenosis and that drives treatment.\" That simplifies the diagnosis dramatically. It would make a big difference. So we think that's important. The second question, I didn't fully understand. Do you mind, Anthony, saying it again? Okay. So we've seen new hospitals come into the system, and that's been -- that's helped with growth. We feel like hospitals have the ability to add capacity if that's really underlying your question and that they do that quite well. They can do it by adding days. They can do it by adding clinicians. And we found them routinely able to do it and not really be a big burden to them. And so it is clearly helpful when the length of stay is shorter but some of it is their own practices. If they're able to do, for example, multiple TAVRs in a day, that really helps if they're able to discharge patient faster, that helps. And all those are improving. And also, I would just say generally, their desire to be able to increase capacity. So it's -- we're getting to a place where TAVR is becoming far more predictable than it had been in the past, and that really helps hospitals' ability to plan. Yes. Adam, I hope your follow-up is for Scott Ullem. He's getting lonely over here without any questions. But let me get to your question. Yes, we're probably approaching something around 800 centers in the U.S. It's interesting even during the pandemic, there's been an increase each quarter, maybe 10 to 20 centers per quarter. And so it's gradually increased. We've been impressed that centers have actually come online during the pandemic, who tells you about their desire to be able to bring the TAVR treatment to these structural heart patients. So we've been doing nicely. I think at the time of the NCD, we thought the number might go to 850. We really don't have any update on that at this point. So maybe that gives you a sense of where we are. Yes, at this point, Adam, we're not prepared to share more about the feature set of the product line. We are still expecting to begin the clinical trial in 2021. And I think maybe even from a bigger picture perspective, although we're really pleased with where we are on TAVR, we're just not going to stop innovating. We continue to find opportunities for us to improve this therapy and make it better for patients and we're just going to stay relentless in that regard. Yes. Pito, I think it's not fair to say that we've really seen meaningful changes in the referral centers. One of the things we have seen though is -- and then we just hear this anecdotally that patients maybe are less likely to travel long distances to a center of excellence, and they're more likely to want to stay local to their centers. And so that's probably been in there to some extent, probably driven some of the behavior during the pandemic. Yes. So a few things. One is, you're right. Surgical rates dropped pretty precipitously in late March. So some of that is a comparable. So that should go into account. But actually, the U.S. was quite strong. It certainly was comparable, if not slightly stronger than the global rates. And so I think it certainly was broad globally, but the U.S. was good. And I don't know if that ended up answering the question. Okay. Well, thanks all very much for your continued interest in Edwards. And Scott and Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. Back to you, Mark."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments.\nMichael Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. During 2022, our company stayed focused on the long term, making meaningful progress on strategic milestones with the potential of transforming patient care. While the challenging environment negatively impacted sales, we still grew 8%.  Looking forward, we remain optimistic that the health care environment will gradually improve and we expect 9% to 12% sales growth in 2023. We didn't pull back on investing in innovation because of the pandemic, and we didn't pull back because sales fell a little short. We continue to aggressively invest during this challenging period, which positions the company for sustained leadership in a new era of structural heart and critical care innovation.  Looking back at 2022, in TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. We received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. In TMTT, each of our platforms demonstrated promising clinical performance, and we received approval for PASCAL Precision in the U.S. and Europe. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the launch of MITRIS in the U.S.  And in Critical Care, we continue to drive adoption of our transformative smart recovery technologies. Although our initial sales expectations for 2022 anticipated a better environment, we delivered balanced contributions across each of our product groups and regions. We achieved 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share while maintaining R&D at more than 17% of sales, which reflects our commitment to driving durable organic sales growth. Consistent with our cash deployment strategy, we opportunistically repurchased stock at an accelerated level in 2022. We continue to invest in our production capacity in anticipation of future growth. and we made a series of external investments in promising early-stage technologies. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Consistent with our guidance, total company sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Our broad portfolio of innovative therapies drove this growth despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. In TAVR, full year 2022 global TAVR sales of $3.5 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis, building on nearly 20% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our original guidance of $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion due to foreign exchange headwinds and Covet induced health care challenges in key countries. In 2022, we announced the approval of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S.  Separately, we continue to advance enrollment in our PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from our alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce our long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.  In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global -- I should say, global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global TAVR sales of $868 million increased 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations. Sales were up slightly over Q3 in dollars and on a constant currency basis and local selling prices were stable.  In the U.S., Edwards fourth quarter TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single-digit range. As expected, our fourth quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by the U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.  Growth in the U.S. was higher in larger volume centers and in states with fewer COVID restrictions as measured by the Daxferns Containment and Health Index. We're encouraged by recent hiring trends, which suggests that hospital employment is rebounding.  As we mentioned, we began the introduction of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. the Resilient issues anti-calcification technology addresses one of the primary causes of reintervention following heart valve replacement and is demonstrating a strong track record of performance in Edwards Surgical house. As of now, this newest valve has been introduced in approximately 10% of U.S. TAVR centers and physician feedback has been encouraging.  Outside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards TAVR procedures also grew in the mid-single digits, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. In Q4, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low.  In Europe, fourth quarter procedures grew in line with the global rate. Market growth continued to be impacted by a bump in the COVID cases and staffing shortages, which reduced hospital capacity, particularly in larger countries such as Germany. And even though there are a broad range of competitors, our leadership position and local selling prices remained stable throughout the year.  Importantly, a cost-effectiveness study published earlier this month demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN three was economically beneficial when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating German patients with low surgical risk. The data suggests that TAVR enhances quality of life and offers a cost-effective option over the long term. These findings are consistent with the cost-effective outcomes for the use of SAPIEN 3 in France, Italy and Spain.  In Japan, fourth quarter procedure growth was much slower than expected due to an extended COVID wave and continued restrictions, which limited hospital staffing and capacity. We expect these factors to diminish substantially over the course of 2023 and look forward to launching SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan later this year. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.  In summary, our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges improved during 2023 as hospital resource constraints decrease. We remain positive in our outlook for 2023 underlying TAVR sales growth of 9% to 12%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. We remain confident in this large global opportunity that will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.  Turning to TMTT. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 10,000 patients with the PASCAL repair system. We achieved significant milestones in 2022 and made meaningful progress toward achieving our vision to transform care for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. Following the Class II presentation at TCT and FDA approval in Q3, we initiated the introduction of the PASCAL Precision system in the U.S. Initial feedback from clinicians has been positive, and we're pleased with the patient outcomes to date. Class IID full cohort of 300 patients with 1-year follow-up will be presented in the second half of 2023.  In Europe, the PASCAL Precision launch is ongoing with a focus on bringing this latest advancement to our existing centers as well as expanding into new centers. Also aligned with our commitment to generate high-quality scientific evidence we continue to advance enrollment in our Class IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, we're making good progress on the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and expect to complete enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. The sub French transfemoral valve leverages the SAPIEN 3 platform with a recapturable repositionable dock.  Separately, we've completed enrollment in the MISCEND early feasibility study with the Eos valve and are incorporating the learnings from this early experience into our next generation. We believe the Eos platform has the potential to be an excellent option for mitral patients, who have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.  Shifting to tricuspid and our strategy of advancing the body of clinical evidence, we are currently enrolling two pivotal trials studying both tricuspid replacement and repair, TRISCEND II and the Class II TR. We prioritized enrollment in our TRISCEND II study, that study trial that's studying EVOQUE as it addresses the large population of patients who are suffering from debilitating systems and have few treatment options. TRISCEND II is on track for completion of enrollment in the first half of 2023, and we expect Evoke CE mark by the end of this year and U.S. approval around the end of '24.  We're very pleased with the recent tricuspid data presented at PCR London Valves meeting which we reported favorable results from both our TRISCEND study of EVOQUE and the TriCLASP post-market clinical follow-up for PASCAL. In Europe, clinicians are very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL Precision system in their tricuspid patients, and we're looking forward to bringing this therapy to patients in the U.S. following the Class II TR trial.  Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter sales of $32 million were consistent with our latest guidance and driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe supported by the early initiation of PASCAL Precision in the U.S. Full year global sales were $116 million, up nearly 50% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. In 2023, we expect TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million.  We look forward to advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease through the milestones outlined in our recent investor conference. We remain committed to bringing this differentiated portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership.  In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $893 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $224 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by the increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite COVID challenges in certain regions. Although hospital staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we believe that heart valve surgery was prioritized.  We have seen strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. We believe that surgeons value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. We saw adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. increased in the fourth quarter. And built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions.  We are growing the large body of RESILIA evidence with our new Momentis clinical study to demonstrate the durability of this tissue in the mitral position. Enrollment in this study was initiated earlier this month. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2023 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single digits for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and growth of overall heart valve surgeries.  Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $855 million increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $225 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery. In our Smart Recovery portfolio, adoption of FloTrac and ClearSight sensors featuring our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm RECONNECT remains strong. Demand for our pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU due to elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. As discussed at our recent investor conference, sales growth in 2023. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of critical care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.  And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide a wrap-up of 2022, including detailed results for the fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023.  So as Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter grew 7% on a constant currency basis, despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. Our gross profit margin was healthy, even excluding the temporarily inflated rate due to FX. Combined with sales growth and disciplined spending, this resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $0.64. GAAP earnings per share was $0.65.  Obviously, we were disappointed with our stock performance last year. The only upside to the poor stock price performance was that it provided an opportunistic time to repurchase shares more aggressively. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. And in total, we repurchased $1.7 billion of stock last year. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter fell to $616 million. We have approximately $900 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  For the full year 2022, sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis to $5.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% and we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. We expect our sales growth rate to expand in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing. Although still early in the year, we saw encouraging signals during Q4 and a good start so far in Q1, which reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% full year range.  We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2023. Absent big moves in FX, we expect total company sales of $5.6 billion to $6 billion, TAVR sales of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million, Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $970 million and critical care sales of $840 million to $940 million. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.64.  Now I'll cover details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 81% compared to 76.8% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our FX program which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar.  At current foreign exchange rates, we continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. At current exchange rates, the reduction in this year's forecasted gross profit margin versus 2022 reflects 250 to 300 basis points of reduced benefit from FX plus some incremental inflation. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter decreased 3% over the prior year to $411 million or 30.5% of sales, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar and partially offset by continued investments in the ongoing build-out of the U.S. TMTT commercial team and our high-touch model for TAVR. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 29% and 30%. Research and development expenses in the quarter were consistent with the prior year at $232 million, or 17.2% of sales. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2023 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth.  Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.3% and or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. We continue to expect our 2023 tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by six percentage points or $73 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect approximately flat year-over-year impact from foreign exchange to full year 2023 sales. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross margin by 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share.  Finally, before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the end of the year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $214 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $283 million, less capital spending of $69 million. In 2023, we expect free cash flow to grow to $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion.  And with that, I'll pass the call back over to Mike.\nMichael Mussallem: Thank you, Scott. [indiscernible] informational therapies covering solid financial performance. We expect higher growth and meaningful in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital. We believe to serve our patients -- we're confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and health care systems worldwide.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Scott. With that, we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Diego?\nOperator: And at this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And before I ask, Mike, we couldn't hear your closing remarks before. So I don't know if you're a little far away from a microphone or not.\nMichael Mussallem: Okay.\nRobert Marcus: There we are. Okay.\nMichael Mussallem: If you like, I'd be happy to give you the conclusion, why don't I give that for a second. Thanks, Robbie, and we'll she'll be first in line here. I just said, in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in advancing 2022 and the new transformational therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance. We expect higher growth and meaningful progress in '23 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing and growth across all major regions.  And as the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we believe that the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028, and we're confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and health care systems worldwide. Thanks, Robbie. You're back up.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe to start, you talked about improving trends in TAVR and what you're seeing so far in first quarter. Maybe you could spend a little more time and give us detail on exactly what some of those improvements were throughout the quarter, how the quarter trended and what gives you confidence in the 2023 TAVR guide based on what you've seen so far?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. I'm not going to get really deep into the quarter. As Scott mentioned, we had some really positive times during the quarter, where we saw some weeks were really strong. We had the normal seasonality that we see in a quarter where things get soft around the holidays. But if I just elevate, I think what's on the mind of some of our investors that we had a few quarters of single-digit growth, but that certainly does not dampen our enthusiasm for our strategy.  COVID just wasn't kind to structural heart patients. And we know that there are many consequences of COVID affected global growth companies, including Edwards. So if we just replay, 2020, COVID drove pretty much flat sales growth for us. In 2021, it was a big growth year. Edwards grew 18%. And in '22, although we experienced the lingering impact of COVID, tough comparisons and all that we still grew 8% and more importantly, in '23, we remain confident that sales are going to grow 9% to 12%.  So we just think the environment is going to improve. We feel strongly that COVID's impact is transient and that treating these structural heart patients is going to again become a priority.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe as a follow-up, you're a couple of months into the PASCAL launch in the U.S. I'd love to get the initial feedback of what you're hearing from implanters from hospitals and how the first quarter has gone for you so far?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes. Sure, Robbie. This is Daveen. I'll take that question. So far at a high level, feedback from physicians in the Pascal precision launch has been really positive, right? I think people love the ease of use, the navigation improvements of this new system and we know that we received early approval in the U.S. and Europe. So we're ramping the inventory to kind of improve these launches.  And I think really in the U.S., our mantra is all about patient outcomes. And so we are really focused on our high-touch model. We're really focused on getting great clinical outcomes, gradual introduction have a really strong training program. So, so far to date, we've been really impressed with that.  And finally, I'll say, I think we've got great Class IID data that came out, obviously, at TCT. And we're convinced that they'll have a positive impact in the tier market overall, and we think that more and more physicians would be interested in using the PASCAL Precision system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: I wanted to start with a high-level question. Obviously, there's a lot of concerns on the U.S. TAVR market, Mike, as you mentioned earlier, among investors. I wanted to ask about actually next year '24, because it looks like you have three major trials being presented potentially early TAVR for asymptomatic, the unload trial for moderate AS, TRISCEND II with EVOQUE for tricuspid. How do you guys rank these opportunities? And do you expect these three trials to accelerate your growth? And I have one follow-up.\nLarry Wood: This is Larry. Related to early TAVR, just as a reminder, that trial has a 2-year endpoint. So we just completed the 1-year follow-up at the end of last year. So we haven't -- these patients have another year to go. So that data wouldn't be available really until 2024. Unload is an IAS study, so that's really kind of out of our hands. We provide funding for that, but that's really up to the investigators in terms of when they present that data. And maybe I'll turn it over to Daveen for TRISCEND, or Bernard.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, I'll just make a comment on TRISCEND. So for the TRISCEND II study, we expect obviously release the information in the second half of the year and release the information in the second half of the year. So we're excited about the data we think to help it. But as you pull up here, I think this all helps us make us feel good about this year and then driving into 2024.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. And I'll just add -- this is Mike again, Larry. Yes, we're feeling positive about 2024. It's a long way off. So it's too soon to give guidance at this point. But when we look at the road ahead, we really think as the system learns to deal with COVID and it fades back into the rearview mirror that structural heart patients are going to get prioritized again. And we think that they're going to be anxious to treat these patients. We love our lineup of technologies, our lineup of clinical trials that are pointed in indication expansion. And so we see -- that's why we feel confident in that 2028 outlook.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. And just to add on to that, we did see, as Mike mentioned, we saw some weeks in Q4 that were really strong. And I think it's just evidence that staffing is gradually improving, maybe not as fast as we want. And we certainly saw some impact, especially around the holiday period, but we still have the SAPIEN 3 UR launch. We have other things that we're really excited about, and we feel very good about next year -- or this year, sorry.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up. I didn't hear anything -- sorry if I missed it on the Alliance trial in Safety and X4, is there an update there?\nLarry Wood: Yes. No, we don't have any update there. I think what we said at the investor conference is we expect to be back in clinic this year, and we still anticipate that. But we don't have anything new to add.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: I think for the first question, Mike, on the TAVR trends, I think U.S. was up mid-singles overall TAVR up mid-singles, implies international was mid-single. So maybe talk was there any China impact or would happen in international. And I think on the last call, you noted half the centers in the U.S. were up double digits, half then were flattish. Was that a trend that you saw this quarter as well? Or how are you thinking about TAVR progression here?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. I'll talk a little bit about OUS and then Larry can get a little deeper in the U.S. So outside the U.S., procedures grew in the mid-single digits. And as we mentioned, outside of Europe and Japan, it grew even faster. In Q4, we experienced some challenges that resulted in sort of, if you will, the U.S. and Europe in mid-single digit as expected, Japan was worse than we thought, and the rest of the world was better than we thought. So that's sort of the way that things kind of netted out. We expect contributions from all the regions to be better in '23 as we are projecting that 9% to 12% growth rate. Your other question was trying to differentiate what was different in the U.S?\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, half the centers were up double digits, I think, last quarter. Was there a trend that you saw this quarter as well?\nLarry Wood: Yes. We saw significant variation on a site-to-site basis. Clearly, some centers, and I think it maybe reflects kind of localized COVID restrictions. Some centers certainly did better than other centers. And gradually, we see that improving over time. But larger centers probably did a little bit better than the smaller centers. You had a question on China as well. China was certainly impacted, but for our TAVR business, it's such a small base. It's not a huge driver one way or the other.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Larry. And Scott, maybe a quick 1 for you. I think Q1 guidance here at the midpoint almost, I think it's hinting at 10% organic, close to high single, low double organic -- what's driving the sequential acceleration from the high singles organic we saw in Q4? Has the visibility improved? Or just talk about assumptions around Q1?\nScott Ullem: Well, it ties to what we've been talking about so far on the call, our guidance for Q1 is $1,350 to $1,450 million, so call it $1.410 billion in sales at the midpoint of the range. Which is if you just sort of think about how the year is going to play out at the lower end of the 9% to 12% underlying growth rate guidance that we've given for sales. So your question is what happened between Q4 and Q1 and it ties back to we're just seeing generally a favorable environment, hospital staffing levels and health care disruptions gradually getting a little bit better. And it's really very similar to what we talked about at our investor conference and reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% growth rate that we can achieve for the full year in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: So I'll keep it to one question. Just on some of the comments that you talked about, Scott, I think in your comments around starting to see some encouraging trends early this year, gradual improvements maybe towards the end of Q4. Given the sort of many things that have been talked about as potentially having this sort of slowing impact on U.S. TAVR trends around staffing availability of nurses and the confusion around some centers being double digits and some being slower. Can you maybe talk about a few things that you are seeing that sort of bring you to sort of point out this encouraging trend. Which of these things you're getting better? What gives you that encouragement?\nScott Ullem: Well, it's a good question. It's tough to isolate all the elements that are going into just the first couple of weeks of the year. But generally speaking, overall, it seems like the trends are favorable. And this is what we expected to happen in 2023 with hospital staffing constraints abating with overall disruptions in the health care system, getting a little bit better in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And just the multiple different signals that we see and anecdotes that we hear give us confidence that we're on the right track.  And again, looking to the 9% to 12% growth rate guidance for 2023. January, it's pretty early to say, but obviously, we wouldn't the signals that we've seen in January are reflected in the guidance that we've given in that $13.70 to $14.50 sales range for the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: I have two quick ones. It looks like you have 81% gross margin in the fourth quarter, your guide for '23 is the reversal of your FX hedges. Can you walk us through sort of -- should we just straight line it down over the next couple of quarters, how we should think about that? And then the second question, it sounds like things are getting better. Are you seeing wait lists cropping up in different places?\nScott Ullem: Why don't I take the first piece, and then I'll let somebody else jump in on the wait list question. Just in terms of gross margin, it's pretty simple. I mean there are a bunch of little moving pieces. We always get a little bit of benefit from mix. We get a little bit of benefit from all of the activities we have to improve efficiency in global supply chain. But really, the difference between the gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the full year 2022 versus the guidance we've given for 2023 and is all FX. And FX hits us with both hedge contracts that we have as well as inventory valuations outside of the U.S. that's really the source of the decline from 2022 to 2023 gross margins.\nMichael Mussallem: And on the backlog question, Joanne, as we've mentioned before, we don't have great analytics on backlogs. And so a lot of it we just hear anecdotally from customers. But what we do here say, yes, indeed, there is backlog that's spotty and across the U.S. and other countries for that matter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Mike, I wanted to go back to the COVID-related headwinds in the U.S. and one hypothesis that I think concerns investors what you guys really haven't talked much about is the idea that excess mortality in your patient population could have depleted your pool and that, that might take longer to normalize than something that's a little bit simpler like hospital staffing. Do you see that as a significant factor? Or do you still view it as a bottom of the funnel issue with capacity?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Just at the highest level, sadly, for these patients, it's true. There has to be some mortality that goes on. They just don't wait well. And we know that, that's a very serious consequence of the environment that we're in. Having said that, this isn't a small pool. It's a really, really big pool. And so even the sad mortality that comes from this is not close to really putting a dent in the number of patients that could legitimately use help through having their severe AS treated.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one on mitral. Any line of sight into Class I and T completing enrollment of those studies have been going on for a while and I don't think you guys have provided a time line there.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes. So this is Daveen. So I'll follow up a little bit on Class II TR first and I'll talk about IIF separately. So first, on Class II TRs, you remember, we think that in our prioritization, while we think tier for tricuspid is really important, we actually believe that EVOQUE has the potential to be more important to tricuspid patients. But we know that this is a large and diverse population of people. So we've got to have a portfolio of options.  So we were committed to running two different pivotal studies, obviously, the TRISCEND II for EVOQUE as well as the Class II TR for PASCAL. And many of these sites are actually -- many of our clinical sites, especially in the U.S. actually have both trials at that site. So what we did is we actually ask sites to prioritize TRISCEND II enrollment and actually drive that fastest. And so that's on track to kind of complete enrollment here in the first half of 2023, as we've kind of talked about before. So now as that finishes up, we're asking kind of sites to kind of drive enrollment in Class II TR hopefully, we'll then see enrollment in that trial then pick up.  And moving on to Class IIF, right, our functional kind of trial a randomized trial. We haven't yet kind of shared expectation for kind of approval or commercialization yet on that. That trial is enrolling right now. It's a really important trial for us. And again, a lot of the sites that were actually in Class IID again, the other mitral, were also sites that are also in Class IIF. And as you imagine, we initially said, \"Hey, guys, let's really drive enrollment in Class IID and which the sites did really well,\" they helped drive our approval. And now we've again asked them to kind of switch their prioritization to Class IIF. So we see kind of the enrollment in that trial, which is again, it's a larger trial, a 450-person trial kind of enrolling right now. So that's kind of an update on those two trials.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecila Furlong with Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: I wanted to ask just a follow-up question on TAVR in Japan. How you're thinking about a cadence in '23 following a bit more pressure. It sounded like in -- and then just as you think about the impact from low-risk patients, additional patients coming into the funnel there as well as RESILIA rollout, if you could talk to us about your strategy and pricing strategy there, too?\nMichael Mussallem: Maybe I'll start out with Japan and then turn it over to Larry for the others that he can sort of complete the thought. Japan had been a real lift to our growth rate for the past few years and even earlier this year. But when that wave of COVID came through in Q3, it really was a setback for that health care system. And the way that the Japanese system deals with it is to implement a lot of restrictions. And so that really had some pretty big impact in Q3, and that continued into Q4. It was even more dramatic in Q4 than we expected.  The situation is much better in Japan. And so we see a very solid, substantial improvement during the course of 2023. So we expect Japan to be a real contributor to growth going forward. Larry?\nOperator: We can't hear Larry.\nLarry Wood: Sorry, can you hear me okay now?\nOperator: Yes, go ahead.\nLarry Wood: Okay. So the -- there's a lot of things to be excited about in Japan. In addition to the recovery that Mike talked about more broadly, we do have S3 Ultra RESILIA that's coming probably right before the -- probably in Q2, then we'll begin rolling that out. Low-risk approval is also a big thing. We recently got approval for TAVR-in-TAVR, which is a big thing for Japan. So we're really looking for them to recover and get back to more of the historic growth rates.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. And if I could follow up to just RESILIA in the U.S., you talked about 10% center penetration at this point, but can you speak to just your strategy adoption interest in Q1 and how you think about at this point, the cadence of converting centers over the next few quarters?\nLarry Wood: Sure. Yes. So we're really pleased with how the launch has gone so far. Remember, this approval came earlier than we anticipated. So it felt like we had built up a ton of inventory, and so we had to build up that inventory as we roll it out. So we're pretty much right I think, where we plan to be, and we expect the rollout to continue through the entire year. But we're happy with outcome so far. The physician feedback has been positive. And we think it's good for us.  We're also going for a price increase, which is the first price increase that we've done in -- since launch, which has been over 10 years. It's pretty modest. It's less than 5%, but we think it reflects the innovation and the value that we bring with the RESILIA technology.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: A quick clarification and was on FX. I think the revenue guidance stayed the same, but FX was $100 million better. Just wanted to make sure I understood the moving parts on that? And then the question was also on U.S. TAVR. It's hard to tell exactly, but it looks like U.S. TAVR was down versus Q3. So I don't know if there's anything to call specific headwinds in Q4 that maybe weren't in Q3 and if it was actually down in Q3 versus Q4? And then how to think about Q1 in the U.S., can that still be up sequentially and grow kind of year-over-year in that 9% to 12% range?\nScott Ullem: Sure. So on the first question about FX, yes, you're right. We originally anticipated about $100 million headwind to sales based upon recent currency moves, we now think it's about flat. We do think there will be a headwind to sales in the first half. There will be a tailwind to the sales in second half of 2023, but it averages out to flat for the full year.\nMichael Mussallem: If the rates stays though.\nScott Ullem: At the current rate. Regarding TAVR, no, there was actual growth in TAVR in the U.S. over Q3, and we're expecting more growth in Q1 over Q4. So we're seeing sequential growth and year-over-year growth expansion in U.S. TAVR and global TAVR.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Great. I'll recheck the model on that. And then on SAPIEN 3 RESILIA. You mentioned a little bit of color on the launch. Curious how it's gone like price uplift versus volume discounts, you're actually getting all the price? Because I think the guidance is assuming stable pricing. So I just want to make sure I'm clear on how to think about pricing impact this year and maybe the pricing comes more in 2024?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. So we are going for a price increase and we're going for a price increase across the board. What ends up happening with pricing is as volume goes up, we have rebates and those were built in, whether it was SAPIEN 3 pricing or whether it's SAPIEN 3 UR pricing but we are going for a net increase on every SAPIEN 3 UR valve that we have. Again, it's about $1,500 less than 5%, but we are going for that across the board.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: I want to just start with a question on the surgical valve business. It grew at a higher clip than the TAVR franchise in the fourth quarter. And just wanted to maybe get some -- a better understanding on this prioritization of heart surgeries that you called out. Do you expect that to continue and maybe be beneficial to understand price versus volume growth for the surgical valve business in 4Q? And then I just have 1 follow-up.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Well, I'll start and then if I have rent trouble on call my buddy to mean to help me out here. But overall, the thing with surgical patients is they don't require the same amount of work up as a TAVR patients. So they can move through the system faster because they don't require things such as the CT for valve sizing where that's been intraprocedural for the surgeon and so there's just much workup that has to be done for those patients. So maybe it's a little less impacted. I think there's also a mindset that when a patient needs open heart surgery, that, that just is more urgency in the system and those patients can move through a little bit quicker. We'll see how that continues over time. But we continue to drive RESILIA on the surgical side as well. We have the MITRIS launch, which is going, and we continue to advance RESILIA on the aortic side as well with INSPIRIS and those continue. I don't know if you have anything to add, Daveen.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes. The only other comment I'll make is we talk about heart valve surgery being prioritized within hospitals. We see a bit that, as Larry said, in the food chain of kind of surgeries, we see that people generally if they're short in cardiac surgery resources help start moving resources to these really high acuity really important patients from other parts, other surgery departments. So you actually see a little bit of resource moving, which I think has helped cardiac surgery keep its volumes overall.  That being said, the macro picture, right, we always expect that TAVR is going to increase in aortic valve replacement. But we also expect, at the same time, the AVR market is going to continue to grow, and there'll always be these patients with complex disease that need surgery.\nJoshua Jennings: And just a follow-up on the early TAVR results are not in the very near term, but thinking about the asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis bucket and just the percentage of total severe aortic stenosis patients in the United States. You guys have any new kind of estimates in terms of is that a 30% of total, 40% of total or lower? I just wanted to better understand what early TAVR could unlock?\nLarry Wood: Yes, it's a difficult question because the literature is all over the place on this topic, and there's not great studies on this in terms of how it gets looked at. There's a lot of studies out there that say for every asymptomatic -- or for every symptomatic patient, there's an asymptomatic patient, so that's probably on probably the higher end. There's other studies that says that it's a little bit lower.  But I think regardless, it's significant, but I think the bigger issue here is it impacts how patients flow through the system because patients come and the doctor says, how are you feeling? And maybe that day the patient feels fine, but two weeks ago, they were struggling and that doesn't necessarily get picked up. I think if we could take the symptom assertation just out of the equation for patients and if your echo says that you have severe AS, you move directly to therapy. I think it would just be a game changer for how patients flow through the system.  And it's one of the reasons we took on EARLY TAVR is we think we need to have the definitive data that shows what happens when you really stress echo these people, what happens when you really follow patients that are asymptomatic, and that's really the purpose of the trial, but we think it's a significant opportunity to change how aortic stenosis is treated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.\nAdam Maeder: The first question is on ACC, which is coming up in a couple of weeks. I'm wondering if there's anything that you'd call out from an Edwards standpoint in terms of notable clinical data. And then there's a competitor study in the tricuspid space with TRILUMINATE. Do you think that study could potentially catalyze the transcatheter tricuspid market, both repair and replacement? And then I had one follow-up.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, this is Daveen. I'll hit a little bit on the -- obviously, the tricuspid trial, specifically the TRILUMINATE study. We actually wouldn't be surprised if TRILUMINATE shows positive results and gets approved by ACC or around ACC. To me, this would be an amazing opportunity and great opportunity for patients to continue to get more data and have better patient treatment. But that being said, we see actually in Europe right now that clinicians are actually very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL Precision device there and seem to really like it for tricuspid patients. So we look forward to that to obviously bring that technology to the U.S. in the future. But we think for the therapy overall, obviously, more data is helping patient care.\nMichael Mussallem: And then a high level, we'll be at ACC in full force. It's a chance for us to be close to customers. But we don't have any real groundbreaking trials that are going to be introduced at that time.\nAdam Maeder: Okay. And then just for a quick follow-up. One actually on capital. allocation. And clearly, you're going to remain focused within structural heart. But I also think you've talked recently about having interest in a potential new adjacency. And I think referring to heart failure, you have an internal atrial shunt program, and you also have some investments in external assets. So when should we expect to learn more here about these initiatives and just the broader path forward?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Thanks for that, Adam. We don't end up talking about these until some of the risk has been taken out. At these early stages, these are big transformative therapies that have big potential, but they also have pretty big risk at the early stage of the program. And we feel like it's more appropriate to share it with investors when we have more uncertainty. So for example, like we're already in human trials. So we're not likely to talk about this for competitive reasons, but it is something that's very much a priority for our company. We think the kind of skill sets that Edwards has could be applied really, really well to this big group of patients that's the #1 health care burden and cost and mortality both. Operator Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: And thank you for the color on the quarter-over-quarter growth, U.S. TAVR expectation in 1Q. But I'm hoping to just parse out the expectation around cadence for improvement U.S. versus international in three seems like international, a little bit more kind of COVID surge impacted maybe a little more visibility into the turning of the tide there. U.S. more hospital staffing it feels more gradual. A, is that correct? And do you think it's right for us to be modeling a little bit faster recovery and acceleration perhaps in 1Q and the first part of the year internationally and then maybe a little bit more of an acceleration for the U.S. in the back half and keep it more gradual in the first half? Is that a good way to think about it? And do we have the pieces right around your visibility?\nScott Ullem: So Rick, first, on the sequential growth. I want to go back to something Travis asked about before. Q3 to Q4 and 2022, there are sequential growth globally. I said U.S., it was true globally. Q4 through Q1 and 2023, sequential growth in the U.S. and globally. As it relates to the full year 2023 I'll start and then others chime in. We're expecting contributions both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. It's tough to pin down exactly which regions are going to grow what rates. But we think that we're going to get contributions from all of our major regions to that 9% to 12% underlying growth in '23.\nMichael Mussallem: That's right. I mean if we just look at what's happened here in the recent past, whether it's the U.S. or Europe or Japan, our three biggest regions, they've been lower than what they should be based on the struggles that they've had with the aftermath of COVID, and we expect that to improve throughout 2023.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. I guess -- but it's not like you have better visibility into the two factors. The COVID surge impacts in your challenge areas in Germany and Japan, better visibility there versus hospital staffing. It feels like you're saying you expect all of them to move more or less together?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. I would say we have similar visibility on all of them. We're very close to our customers, very close to our centers. and we feel like we know what's happening on a center-by-center basis. And we just feel that the environment has and will continue to improve.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. And just following up to BJ's question. are half of your centers still doing double-digit growth in the U.S. I know it's variant, but do you still see that level of growth from at least a cohort or half of your centers?\nScott Ullem: Yes. I don't know if I could pin it down exactly to a percentage. But certainly, we see a large portion or a large section of our centers that are still doing double-digit growth. And again, I think it's not so much COVID, but it's the COVID restrictions that happen. And I think the parts of the country where those restrictions have been release sooner. I think we see those centers doing better. But we expect the rest to come along. I mean if you look broadly, those restrictions are easing really across the globe, and I think that's what is one of the things that helps us in 2023.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. And Larry, you might add that you saw some weeks during Q4 where there was some significant volume, though and made us feel good about the fact that there must be some capacity out there, right?\nLarry Wood: Yes. We had some of the biggest weeks that we've had in our history in Q4. So a week doesn't make a year, but the fact that they were able to do it for several weeks indicates that staffing is getting better and capacity is coming back into the system, and it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our guidance for 2023.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.\nMichael Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, thanks for participating.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. During 2022, our company stayed focused on the long term, making meaningful progress on strategic milestones with the potential of transforming patient care. While the challenging environment negatively impacted sales, we still grew 8%.  Looking forward, we remain optimistic that the health care environment will gradually improve and we expect 9% to 12% sales growth in 2023. We didn't pull back on investing in innovation because of the pandemic, and we didn't pull back because sales fell a little short. We continue to aggressively invest during this challenging period, which positions the company for sustained leadership in a new era of structural heart and critical care innovation.  Looking back at 2022, in TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. We received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. In TMTT, each of our platforms demonstrated promising clinical performance, and we received approval for PASCAL Precision in the U.S. and Europe. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the launch of MITRIS in the U.S.  And in Critical Care, we continue to drive adoption of our transformative smart recovery technologies. Although our initial sales expectations for 2022 anticipated a better environment, we delivered balanced contributions across each of our product groups and regions. We achieved 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share while maintaining R&D at more than 17% of sales, which reflects our commitment to driving durable organic sales growth. Consistent with our cash deployment strategy, we opportunistically repurchased stock at an accelerated level in 2022. We continue to invest in our production capacity in anticipation of future growth. and we made a series of external investments in promising early-stage technologies. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Consistent with our guidance, total company sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Our broad portfolio of innovative therapies drove this growth despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. In TAVR, full year 2022 global TAVR sales of $3.5 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis, building on nearly 20% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our original guidance of $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion due to foreign exchange headwinds and Covet induced health care challenges in key countries. In 2022, we announced the approval of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S.  Separately, we continue to advance enrollment in our PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from our alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce our long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.  In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global -- I should say, global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global TAVR sales of $868 million increased 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations. Sales were up slightly over Q3 in dollars and on a constant currency basis and local selling prices were stable.  In the U.S., Edwards fourth quarter TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single-digit range. As expected, our fourth quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by the U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.  Growth in the U.S. was higher in larger volume centers and in states with fewer COVID restrictions as measured by the Daxferns Containment and Health Index. We're encouraged by recent hiring trends, which suggests that hospital employment is rebounding.  As we mentioned, we began the introduction of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. the Resilient issues anti-calcification technology addresses one of the primary causes of reintervention following heart valve replacement and is demonstrating a strong track record of performance in Edwards Surgical house. As of now, this newest valve has been introduced in approximately 10% of U.S. TAVR centers and physician feedback has been encouraging.  Outside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards TAVR procedures also grew in the mid-single digits, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. In Q4, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low.  In Europe, fourth quarter procedures grew in line with the global rate. Market growth continued to be impacted by a bump in the COVID cases and staffing shortages, which reduced hospital capacity, particularly in larger countries such as Germany. And even though there are a broad range of competitors, our leadership position and local selling prices remained stable throughout the year.  Importantly, a cost-effectiveness study published earlier this month demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN three was economically beneficial when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating German patients with low surgical risk. The data suggests that TAVR enhances quality of life and offers a cost-effective option over the long term. These findings are consistent with the cost-effective outcomes for the use of SAPIEN 3 in France, Italy and Spain.  In Japan, fourth quarter procedure growth was much slower than expected due to an extended COVID wave and continued restrictions, which limited hospital staffing and capacity. We expect these factors to diminish substantially over the course of 2023 and look forward to launching SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan later this year. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.  In summary, our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges improved during 2023 as hospital resource constraints decrease. We remain positive in our outlook for 2023 underlying TAVR sales growth of 9% to 12%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. We remain confident in this large global opportunity that will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.  Turning to TMTT. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 10,000 patients with the PASCAL repair system. We achieved significant milestones in 2022 and made meaningful progress toward achieving our vision to transform care for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. Following the Class II presentation at TCT and FDA approval in Q3, we initiated the introduction of the PASCAL Precision system in the U.S. Initial feedback from clinicians has been positive, and we're pleased with the patient outcomes to date. Class IID full cohort of 300 patients with 1-year follow-up will be presented in the second half of 2023.  In Europe, the PASCAL Precision launch is ongoing with a focus on bringing this latest advancement to our existing centers as well as expanding into new centers. Also aligned with our commitment to generate high-quality scientific evidence we continue to advance enrollment in our Class IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, we're making good progress on the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and expect to complete enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. The sub French transfemoral valve leverages the SAPIEN 3 platform with a recapturable repositionable dock.  Separately, we've completed enrollment in the MISCEND early feasibility study with the Eos valve and are incorporating the learnings from this early experience into our next generation. We believe the Eos platform has the potential to be an excellent option for mitral patients, who have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.  Shifting to tricuspid and our strategy of advancing the body of clinical evidence, we are currently enrolling two pivotal trials studying both tricuspid replacement and repair, TRISCEND II and the Class II TR. We prioritized enrollment in our TRISCEND II study, that study trial that's studying EVOQUE as it addresses the large population of patients who are suffering from debilitating systems and have few treatment options. TRISCEND II is on track for completion of enrollment in the first half of 2023, and we expect Evoke CE mark by the end of this year and U.S. approval around the end of '24.  We're very pleased with the recent tricuspid data presented at PCR London Valves meeting which we reported favorable results from both our TRISCEND study of EVOQUE and the TriCLASP post-market clinical follow-up for PASCAL. In Europe, clinicians are very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL Precision system in their tricuspid patients, and we're looking forward to bringing this therapy to patients in the U.S. following the Class II TR trial.  Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter sales of $32 million were consistent with our latest guidance and driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe supported by the early initiation of PASCAL Precision in the U.S. Full year global sales were $116 million, up nearly 50% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. In 2023, we expect TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million.  We look forward to advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease through the milestones outlined in our recent investor conference. We remain committed to bringing this differentiated portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership.  In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $893 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $224 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by the increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite COVID challenges in certain regions. Although hospital staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we believe that heart valve surgery was prioritized.  We have seen strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. We believe that surgeons value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. We saw adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. increased in the fourth quarter. And built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions.  We are growing the large body of RESILIA evidence with our new Momentis clinical study to demonstrate the durability of this tissue in the mitral position. Enrollment in this study was initiated earlier this month. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2023 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single digits for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and growth of overall heart valve surgeries.  Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $855 million increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $225 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery. In our Smart Recovery portfolio, adoption of FloTrac and ClearSight sensors featuring our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm RECONNECT remains strong. Demand for our pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU due to elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. As discussed at our recent investor conference, sales growth in 2023. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of critical care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.  And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. [indiscernible] informational therapies covering solid financial performance. We expect higher growth and meaningful in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital. We believe to serve our patients -- we're confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and health care systems worldwide.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Okay. If you like, I'd be happy to give you the conclusion, why don't I give that for a second. Thanks, Robbie, and we'll she'll be first in line here. I just said, in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in advancing 2022 and the new transformational therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance. We expect higher growth and meaningful progress in '23 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing and growth across all major regions.  And as the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we believe that the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028, and we're confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and health care systems worldwide. Thanks, Robbie. You're back up. Yes. I'm not going to get really deep into the quarter. As Scott mentioned, we had some really positive times during the quarter, where we saw some weeks were really strong. We had the normal seasonality that we see in a quarter where things get soft around the holidays. But if I just elevate, I think what's on the mind of some of our investors that we had a few quarters of single-digit growth, but that certainly does not dampen our enthusiasm for our strategy.  COVID just wasn't kind to structural heart patients. And we know that there are many consequences of COVID affected global growth companies, including Edwards. So if we just replay, 2020, COVID drove pretty much flat sales growth for us. In 2021, it was a big growth year. Edwards grew 18%. And in '22, although we experienced the lingering impact of COVID, tough comparisons and all that we still grew 8% and more importantly, in '23, we remain confident that sales are going to grow 9% to 12%.  So we just think the environment is going to improve. We feel strongly that COVID's impact is transient and that treating these structural heart patients is going to again become a priority. Yes. And I'll just add -- this is Mike again, Larry. Yes, we're feeling positive about 2024. It's a long way off. So it's too soon to give guidance at this point. But when we look at the road ahead, we really think as the system learns to deal with COVID and it fades back into the rearview mirror that structural heart patients are going to get prioritized again. And we think that they're going to be anxious to treat these patients. We love our lineup of technologies, our lineup of clinical trials that are pointed in indication expansion. And so we see -- that's why we feel confident in that 2028 outlook. Yes. I'll talk a little bit about OUS and then Larry can get a little deeper in the U.S. So outside the U.S., procedures grew in the mid-single digits. And as we mentioned, outside of Europe and Japan, it grew even faster. In Q4, we experienced some challenges that resulted in sort of, if you will, the U.S. and Europe in mid-single digit as expected, Japan was worse than we thought, and the rest of the world was better than we thought. So that's sort of the way that things kind of netted out. We expect contributions from all the regions to be better in '23 as we are projecting that 9% to 12% growth rate. Your other question was trying to differentiate what was different in the U.S? And on the backlog question, Joanne, as we've mentioned before, we don't have great analytics on backlogs. And so a lot of it we just hear anecdotally from customers. But what we do here say, yes, indeed, there is backlog that's spotty and across the U.S. and other countries for that matter. Yes. Just at the highest level, sadly, for these patients, it's true. There has to be some mortality that goes on. They just don't wait well. And we know that, that's a very serious consequence of the environment that we're in. Having said that, this isn't a small pool. It's a really, really big pool. And so even the sad mortality that comes from this is not close to really putting a dent in the number of patients that could legitimately use help through having their severe AS treated. Maybe I'll start out with Japan and then turn it over to Larry for the others that he can sort of complete the thought. Japan had been a real lift to our growth rate for the past few years and even earlier this year. But when that wave of COVID came through in Q3, it really was a setback for that health care system. And the way that the Japanese system deals with it is to implement a lot of restrictions. And so that really had some pretty big impact in Q3, and that continued into Q4. It was even more dramatic in Q4 than we expected.  The situation is much better in Japan. And so we see a very solid, substantial improvement during the course of 2023. So we expect Japan to be a real contributor to growth going forward. Larry? If the rates stays though. Yes. So we are going for a price increase and we're going for a price increase across the board. What ends up happening with pricing is as volume goes up, we have rebates and those were built in, whether it was SAPIEN 3 pricing or whether it's SAPIEN 3 UR pricing but we are going for a net increase on every SAPIEN 3 UR valve that we have. Again, it's about $1,500 less than 5%, but we are going for that across the board. And then a high level, we'll be at ACC in full force. It's a chance for us to be close to customers. But we don't have any real groundbreaking trials that are going to be introduced at that time. Yes. Thanks for that, Adam. We don't end up talking about these until some of the risk has been taken out. At these early stages, these are big transformative therapies that have big potential, but they also have pretty big risk at the early stage of the program. And we feel like it's more appropriate to share it with investors when we have more uncertainty. So for example, like we're already in human trials. So we're not likely to talk about this for competitive reasons, but it is something that's very much a priority for our company. We think the kind of skill sets that Edwards has could be applied really, really well to this big group of patients that's the #1 health care burden and cost and mortality both. Operator Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. That's right. I mean if we just look at what's happened here in the recent past, whether it's the U.S. or Europe or Japan, our three biggest regions, they've been lower than what they should be based on the struggles that they've had with the aftermath of COVID, and we expect that to improve throughout 2023. Yes. I would say we have similar visibility on all of them. We're very close to our customers, very close to our centers. and we feel like we know what's happening on a center-by-center basis. And we just feel that the environment has and will continue to improve. Yes. And Larry, you might add that you saw some weeks during Q4 where there was some significant volume, though and made us feel good about the fact that there must be some capacity out there, right? Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, thanks for participating."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide a wrap-up of 2022, including detailed results for the fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023.  So as Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter grew 7% on a constant currency basis, despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. Our gross profit margin was healthy, even excluding the temporarily inflated rate due to FX. Combined with sales growth and disciplined spending, this resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $0.64. GAAP earnings per share was $0.65.  Obviously, we were disappointed with our stock performance last year. The only upside to the poor stock price performance was that it provided an opportunistic time to repurchase shares more aggressively. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. And in total, we repurchased $1.7 billion of stock last year. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter fell to $616 million. We have approximately $900 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  For the full year 2022, sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis to $5.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% and we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. We expect our sales growth rate to expand in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing. Although still early in the year, we saw encouraging signals during Q4 and a good start so far in Q1, which reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% full year range.  We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2023. Absent big moves in FX, we expect total company sales of $5.6 billion to $6 billion, TAVR sales of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million, Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $970 million and critical care sales of $840 million to $940 million. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.64.  Now I'll cover details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 81% compared to 76.8% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our FX program which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar.  At current foreign exchange rates, we continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. At current exchange rates, the reduction in this year's forecasted gross profit margin versus 2022 reflects 250 to 300 basis points of reduced benefit from FX plus some incremental inflation. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter decreased 3% over the prior year to $411 million or 30.5% of sales, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar and partially offset by continued investments in the ongoing build-out of the U.S. TMTT commercial team and our high-touch model for TAVR. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 29% and 30%. Research and development expenses in the quarter were consistent with the prior year at $232 million, or 17.2% of sales. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2023 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth.  Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.3% and or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. We continue to expect our 2023 tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by six percentage points or $73 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect approximately flat year-over-year impact from foreign exchange to full year 2023 sales. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross margin by 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share.  Finally, before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the end of the year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $214 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $283 million, less capital spending of $69 million. In 2023, we expect free cash flow to grow to $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion.  And with that, I'll pass the call back over to Mike. Well, it ties to what we've been talking about so far on the call, our guidance for Q1 is $1,350 to $1,450 million, so call it $1.410 billion in sales at the midpoint of the range. Which is if you just sort of think about how the year is going to play out at the lower end of the 9% to 12% underlying growth rate guidance that we've given for sales. So your question is what happened between Q4 and Q1 and it ties back to we're just seeing generally a favorable environment, hospital staffing levels and health care disruptions gradually getting a little bit better. And it's really very similar to what we talked about at our investor conference and reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% growth rate that we can achieve for the full year in 2023. Well, it's a good question. It's tough to isolate all the elements that are going into just the first couple of weeks of the year. But generally speaking, overall, it seems like the trends are favorable. And this is what we expected to happen in 2023 with hospital staffing constraints abating with overall disruptions in the health care system, getting a little bit better in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And just the multiple different signals that we see and anecdotes that we hear give us confidence that we're on the right track.  And again, looking to the 9% to 12% growth rate guidance for 2023. January, it's pretty early to say, but obviously, we wouldn't the signals that we've seen in January are reflected in the guidance that we've given in that $13.70 to $14.50 sales range for the first quarter. Why don't I take the first piece, and then I'll let somebody else jump in on the wait list question. Just in terms of gross margin, it's pretty simple. I mean there are a bunch of little moving pieces. We always get a little bit of benefit from mix. We get a little bit of benefit from all of the activities we have to improve efficiency in global supply chain. But really, the difference between the gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the full year 2022 versus the guidance we've given for 2023 and is all FX. And FX hits us with both hedge contracts that we have as well as inventory valuations outside of the U.S. that's really the source of the decline from 2022 to 2023 gross margins. Sure. So on the first question about FX, yes, you're right. We originally anticipated about $100 million headwind to sales based upon recent currency moves, we now think it's about flat. We do think there will be a headwind to sales in the first half. There will be a tailwind to the sales in second half of 2023, but it averages out to flat for the full year. At the current rate. Regarding TAVR, no, there was actual growth in TAVR in the U.S. over Q3, and we're expecting more growth in Q1 over Q4. So we're seeing sequential growth and year-over-year growth expansion in U.S. TAVR and global TAVR. So Rick, first, on the sequential growth. I want to go back to something Travis asked about before. Q3 to Q4 and 2022, there are sequential growth globally. I said U.S., it was true globally. Q4 through Q1 and 2023, sequential growth in the U.S. and globally. As it relates to the full year 2023 I'll start and then others chime in. We're expecting contributions both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. It's tough to pin down exactly which regions are going to grow what rates. But we think that we're going to get contributions from all of our major regions to that 9% to 12% underlying growth in '23. Yes. I don't know if I could pin it down exactly to a percentage. But certainly, we see a large portion or a large section of our centers that are still doing double-digit growth. And again, I think it's not so much COVID, but it's the COVID restrictions that happen. And I think the parts of the country where those restrictions have been release sooner. I think we see those centers doing better. But we expect the rest to come along. I mean if you look broadly, those restrictions are easing really across the globe, and I think that's what is one of the things that helps us in 2023."

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "This is Larry. Related to early TAVR, just as a reminder, that trial has a 2-year endpoint. So we just completed the 1-year follow-up at the end of last year. So we haven't -- these patients have another year to go. So that data wouldn't be available really until 2024. Unload is an IAS study, so that's really kind of out of our hands. We provide funding for that, but that's really up to the investigators in terms of when they present that data. And maybe I'll turn it over to Daveen for TRISCEND, or Bernard. Yes. No, we don't have any update there. I think what we said at the investor conference is we expect to be back in clinic this year, and we still anticipate that. But we don't have anything new to add. Yes. We saw significant variation on a site-to-site basis. Clearly, some centers, and I think it maybe reflects kind of localized COVID restrictions. Some centers certainly did better than other centers. And gradually, we see that improving over time. But larger centers probably did a little bit better than the smaller centers. You had a question on China as well. China was certainly impacted, but for our TAVR business, it's such a small base. It's not a huge driver one way or the other. Sorry, can you hear me okay now? Okay. So the -- there's a lot of things to be excited about in Japan. In addition to the recovery that Mike talked about more broadly, we do have S3 Ultra RESILIA that's coming probably right before the -- probably in Q2, then we'll begin rolling that out. Low-risk approval is also a big thing. We recently got approval for TAVR-in-TAVR, which is a big thing for Japan. So we're really looking for them to recover and get back to more of the historic growth rates. Sure. Yes. So we're really pleased with how the launch has gone so far. Remember, this approval came earlier than we anticipated. So it felt like we had built up a ton of inventory, and so we had to build up that inventory as we roll it out. So we're pretty much right I think, where we plan to be, and we expect the rollout to continue through the entire year. But we're happy with outcome so far. The physician feedback has been positive. And we think it's good for us.  We're also going for a price increase, which is the first price increase that we've done in -- since launch, which has been over 10 years. It's pretty modest. It's less than 5%, but we think it reflects the innovation and the value that we bring with the RESILIA technology. Sure. Well, I'll start and then if I have rent trouble on call my buddy to mean to help me out here. But overall, the thing with surgical patients is they don't require the same amount of work up as a TAVR patients. So they can move through the system faster because they don't require things such as the CT for valve sizing where that's been intraprocedural for the surgeon and so there's just much workup that has to be done for those patients. So maybe it's a little less impacted. I think there's also a mindset that when a patient needs open heart surgery, that, that just is more urgency in the system and those patients can move through a little bit quicker. We'll see how that continues over time. But we continue to drive RESILIA on the surgical side as well. We have the MITRIS launch, which is going, and we continue to advance RESILIA on the aortic side as well with INSPIRIS and those continue. I don't know if you have anything to add, Daveen. Yes, it's a difficult question because the literature is all over the place on this topic, and there's not great studies on this in terms of how it gets looked at. There's a lot of studies out there that say for every asymptomatic -- or for every symptomatic patient, there's an asymptomatic patient, so that's probably on probably the higher end. There's other studies that says that it's a little bit lower.  But I think regardless, it's significant, but I think the bigger issue here is it impacts how patients flow through the system because patients come and the doctor says, how are you feeling? And maybe that day the patient feels fine, but two weeks ago, they were struggling and that doesn't necessarily get picked up. I think if we could take the symptom assertation just out of the equation for patients and if your echo says that you have severe AS, you move directly to therapy. I think it would just be a game changer for how patients flow through the system.  And it's one of the reasons we took on EARLY TAVR is we think we need to have the definitive data that shows what happens when you really stress echo these people, what happens when you really follow patients that are asymptomatic, and that's really the purpose of the trial, but we think it's a significant opportunity to change how aortic stenosis is treated. Yes. We had some of the biggest weeks that we've had in our history in Q4. So a week doesn't make a year, but the fact that they were able to do it for several weeks indicates that staffing is getting better and capacity is coming back into the system, and it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our guidance for 2023."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yes. Sure, Robbie. This is Daveen. I'll take that question. So far at a high level, feedback from physicians in the Pascal precision launch has been really positive, right? I think people love the ease of use, the navigation improvements of this new system and we know that we received early approval in the U.S. and Europe. So we're ramping the inventory to kind of improve these launches.  And I think really in the U.S., our mantra is all about patient outcomes. And so we are really focused on our high-touch model. We're really focused on getting great clinical outcomes, gradual introduction have a really strong training program. So, so far to date, we've been really impressed with that.  And finally, I'll say, I think we've got great Class IID data that came out, obviously, at TCT. And we're convinced that they'll have a positive impact in the tier market overall, and we think that more and more physicians would be interested in using the PASCAL Precision system. Yes, I'll just make a comment on TRISCEND. So for the TRISCEND II study, we expect obviously release the information in the second half of the year and release the information in the second half of the year. So we're excited about the data we think to help it. But as you pull up here, I think this all helps us make us feel good about this year and then driving into 2024. Yes. So this is Daveen. So I'll follow up a little bit on Class II TR first and I'll talk about IIF separately. So first, on Class II TRs, you remember, we think that in our prioritization, while we think tier for tricuspid is really important, we actually believe that EVOQUE has the potential to be more important to tricuspid patients. But we know that this is a large and diverse population of people. So we've got to have a portfolio of options.  So we were committed to running two different pivotal studies, obviously, the TRISCEND II for EVOQUE as well as the Class II TR for PASCAL. And many of these sites are actually -- many of our clinical sites, especially in the U.S. actually have both trials at that site. So what we did is we actually ask sites to prioritize TRISCEND II enrollment and actually drive that fastest. And so that's on track to kind of complete enrollment here in the first half of 2023, as we've kind of talked about before. So now as that finishes up, we're asking kind of sites to kind of drive enrollment in Class II TR hopefully, we'll then see enrollment in that trial then pick up.  And moving on to Class IIF, right, our functional kind of trial a randomized trial. We haven't yet kind of shared expectation for kind of approval or commercialization yet on that. That trial is enrolling right now. It's a really important trial for us. And again, a lot of the sites that were actually in Class IID again, the other mitral, were also sites that are also in Class IIF. And as you imagine, we initially said, \"Hey, guys, let's really drive enrollment in Class IID and which the sites did really well,\" they helped drive our approval. And now we've again asked them to kind of switch their prioritization to Class IIF. So we see kind of the enrollment in that trial, which is again, it's a larger trial, a 450-person trial kind of enrolling right now. So that's kind of an update on those two trials. Yes. The only other comment I'll make is we talk about heart valve surgery being prioritized within hospitals. We see a bit that, as Larry said, in the food chain of kind of surgeries, we see that people generally if they're short in cardiac surgery resources help start moving resources to these really high acuity really important patients from other parts, other surgery departments. So you actually see a little bit of resource moving, which I think has helped cardiac surgery keep its volumes overall.  That being said, the macro picture, right, we always expect that TAVR is going to increase in aortic valve replacement. But we also expect, at the same time, the AVR market is going to continue to grow, and there'll always be these patients with complex disease that need surgery. Yes, this is Daveen. I'll hit a little bit on the -- obviously, the tricuspid trial, specifically the TRILUMINATE study. We actually wouldn't be surprised if TRILUMINATE shows positive results and gets approved by ACC or around ACC. To me, this would be an amazing opportunity and great opportunity for patients to continue to get more data and have better patient treatment. But that being said, we see actually in Europe right now that clinicians are actually very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL Precision device there and seem to really like it for tricuspid patients. So we look forward to that to obviously bring that technology to the U.S. in the future. But we think for the therapy overall, obviously, more data is helping patient care."

And I think it's just evidence that staffing is gradually improving, maybe not as fast as we want. And we certainly saw some impact, especially around the holiday period, but we still have the SAPIEN 3 UR launch. We have other things that we're really excited about, and we feel very good about next year -- or this year, sorry."

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem for his comments. Mike?\nMichael Mussallem: Thanks, Mark. The third quarter strengthened our conviction in our company's patient-focused innovation strategy. Globally, structural heart procedures grew less than we expected in the third quarter, but that didn't slow us down, as our team accomplished numerous important milestones and made good progress on our multiple clinical trials and next-generation technologies. In August, we received European regulatory approval for PASCAL PRECISION. This unique system is designed for transcatheter-based edge-to-edge leaflet repair in patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  Shortly thereafter, in September, we received early U.S. FDA approval for PASCAL PRECISION for the treatment of patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation, which was welcome news for clinicians who appreciate this differentiated platform. And in TAVR, last month, we announced approval to begin selling the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the U.S. our industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter aortic heart valve now incorporates Edwards' breakthrough RESILIA technology. Additionally, during the third quarter, enrollment accelerated in our 2 TAVR pivotal trials, progress evaluating patients with moderate AS and Alliance for our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.  These transformative developments reinforce our confidence in the continued growth of transcatheter-based structural heart inventive. We will continue to aggressively pursue breakthrough technologies with the potential to help even a broader group of patients and in turn drive significant future value. Now turning to our financial performance. Third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Our broad portfolio of innovative technologies drove this growth, although it was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan.  Adjusted EPS grew 13% even while aggressively investing in R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies. For full year 2022, we expect total Edwards sales will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange and be at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We anticipate hospital staffing challenges and a predictive difficult winter COVID and flu season will continue into next year. In TAVR, third quarter global sales of $862 million increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Sales were below our expectations due primarily to the persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan, which intensified the typical impact of summer seasonality.  In the third quarter, we're pleased that well over 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN across our more than 2,000 global TAVR centers. We estimate that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the third quarter. Local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined due to the weakening euro and yen. In the U.S., our TAVR procedures increased in the mid-single digits versus the prior year. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.  As expected, our third quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes continued to be impacted by regional U.S. staffing constraints, which were somewhat worse than we anticipated. There were a high level of variability in growth rates across centers around the country. And while staffing issues limited overall growth during the quarter, nearly half of our TAVR centers grew double digit in Q3. Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our TAVR sales grew in the low double digits on a constant currency basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable.  Our underlying 3-year compounded annual growth rate outside the U.S. remains in the mid-teens. In Q3, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low. In Europe, sales were down sequentially as expected, even though we compete with a broad range of competitors, our competitive position remains stable. Scattered staffing shortages slightly exacerbated summer seasonality, and we anticipate some lingering regional impact on that.  In Japan, third quarter procedure growth was impacted by a widespread seventh wave of COVID, which created a significant strain on hospital capacity and limited TAVR procedure volumes. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 varied across the country as patients and the providers were incentivized to turn their focus again to the treatment of patients with COVID. We saw TAVR procedure volumes improve as COVID hospitalizations decreased late in the third quarter. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.  In summary, we anticipate the continuation of staffing shortages and a difficult winter, COVID and flu season. We expect Q4 TAVR sales to be around $850 million and full year 2022 TAVR sales to be at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We remain confident about the long-term potential of TAVR as the rapidly evolving evidence recognized by policymakers around the world supports continued adoption of this therapy for the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis.  This broad-based, favorable evidence, combined with the undertreatment rate and growing elderly population supports our expectation that this global TAVR opportunity will reach $10 billion by 2028, which implies a low double-digit compounded annual growth rate. Turning now to our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies product group. Recently, we received U.S. FDA and European CE Mark approval of PASCAL PRECISION. This next-generation system designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience will enable us to initiate our commercial presence in the U.S. for the treatment of patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation and also expand PASCAL adoption in Europe for both mitral and tricuspid patients.  This exciting news was followed by the presentation of first results from the Class IID pivotal trial at the recent TCT conference. This first-of-a-kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial further established the safety and efficacy of mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. We were pleased that this data demonstrated that PASCAL is a beneficial therapy expanding transcatheter treatment options for DMR patients. In addition, we continue to advance enrollment of our Class IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation.  Separately, we continue to treat patients with our 2 transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. We are pleased with our progress and believe these sub-30 French transfemoral therapies will help transform treatment for patients and expand the mitral opportunity. Turning to tricuspid. We continue to make progress enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement system and the Class IIR pivotal trial with the PASCAL repair system in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We no longer anticipate CE Mark approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe this year.  As uncertainties remain around the MDR process, we now expect a CE Mark approval late in 2023, with sales contribution in 2024 when we expect to have reimbursement in place. We're excited about this therapy for the many tricuspid patients who have few treatment options today. Looking ahead to PCR London Valves conference in November, we expect numerous late-breaking data presentations across the TMTT portfolio. Especially noteworthy is new 1-year follow-up data on our early experience with the EVOQUE tricuspid valve.  We expect these presentations to contribute positively to the growing body of compelling clinical evidence for our comprehensive portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Third quarter sales of $30 million grew sequentially from the second quarter despite summer seasonality. Adoption of the PASCAL system in Europe increased as we initiated a limited introduction of PASCAL PRECISION, and we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients as we progress on a gradual expansion into more centers in Europe. We forecast to increase the number of procedures in Q4, yet expect reported Q4 sales to be similar to Q3 as a result of FX headwinds and a spike in COVID in Germany, our largest region in Europe.  We're pleased with our continued progress to our bring portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales of $220 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite staffing challenges in certain regions.  And although staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we're observing that cardiac surgeries are being prioritized. We continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally as we bolster the overall body of evidence, including 4 abstracts recently presented at the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Annual Meeting in Milan. We continue to believe that physicians value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. Adoption of the MITRIS valve launched in the U.S. in April now represents the majority of our mitral valve sales in this region.  Separately, we've decided to exit our HARPOON surgical mitral repair system and stop enrollment in the related clinical trials. Given our experience to date, we made the difficult decision to focus on developing other innovative therapies to better serve patients and continue to be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and surgical market growth.  In Critical Care, third quarter sales of $207 million increased 3% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. The growth rate was impacted by a very strong prior year comparison. Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of our broad portfolio of smart recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm. Additionally, demand for our HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for the full year 2022. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make even more informed decisions for patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Great. Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.32 billion in the quarter, representing growth of 6.7% on a constant currency basis, fell short of our expectations, driven by a slower-than-expected recovery of U.S. hospital staffing and COVID in Japan. Our strong underlying gross profit margin combined with a minimal spending increase resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to $0.61. GAAP EPS was $0.55, which included a net $57 million pretax charge or $0.07 per share related to the HARPOON discontinuation.  We anticipate that the U.S. hospital staffing challenge is likely to persist, and we now expect total company sales at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. And TAVR sales also at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million, and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For the fourth quarter, we're projecting sales and adjusted earnings per share to be similar to Q3.  We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, up from 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.22. I'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the third quarter was 81.0% compared to 76.3% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our foreign exchange program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar.  At current FX rates, we continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be approximately 80%. This year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange as compared to 2021. At current rates, FX is expected to result in an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit and operating margins in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter increased 3.5% over the prior year to $377 million or 28.6% of sales primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team.  Research and development expenses in the quarter declined 2% over the prior year to $234 million or 17.7% of sales. The decline reflects unusually high year ago spending. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2022 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. The discontinuation of our surgical HARPOON program resulted in a net $0.07 per share charge consisting of a noncash impairment of intangible assets, a reduction of contingent liabilities and other related exit costs.  Additional details of the charge and a reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS is included with today's release. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 15.7% or 17% excluding the impact of special items. This quarter's higher rate reflected a lower benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our 11% to 15% range. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 6 percentage points or $74 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we estimate a year-over-year FX impact to fourth quarter sales of more than $100 million.  In total, we now expect an approximate $270 million negative impact or 5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, and we expect nearly the same negative impact to full year 2023 sales. FX rates positively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 440 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $250 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $310 million, less capital spending of $60 million.  So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were $625 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $100 million. Year-to-date, through the end of Q3, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $861 million.  We expect shares at the end of the year will be slightly below our previous $625 million to $630 million share range. We now have $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. And with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\nMichael Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. Well, despite ongoing procedure headwinds associated with the pandemic, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance, which includes strong progress on strategic milestones. We believe hospital staffing constraints will gradually improve and are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy for the broad group of patients still suffering from structural heart disease. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will allow us to treat more patients and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Mike. Before we transition to Q&A, I want to remind everyone that our 2022 investor conference will take place on Thursday, December 8, at the New York Stock Exchange. Thank you to everyone who has confirmed your in-person attendance. We're really looking forward to seeing you soon at this historic venue. In addition to our 2023 financial guidance, you'll hear more about Edwards' focused innovation strategy and our comprehensive and exciting product pipeline.  More information will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Edwards website at ir.edwards.com. With that, we're ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities.\nLawrence Biegelsen: I wanted to ask one on 2023, just a framework and some things to consider and then one on tricuspid, Mike and Scott. Just starting with 2023, I think people are going to look at the second half implied growth year, call it, 7% by my math. And maybe there'll be -- maybe that will raise some concerns about growth next year. So Mike, can you provide some framework for how to think about '23? Any catalyst to call out and stop P&L considerations that we should take into account? I heard the FX headwind, the 250 basis points, just any high-level thoughts given the shortfall last quarter and this quarter? And I had one follow-up.\nScott Ullem: So Larry, it's Scott. Why don't I start with the financial piece of that and then turn it over to Mike to talk about some of the strategic things that we expect in 2023. Financially, we haven't gotten into the quarter-by-quarter FX impact or growth rates. Typically, we don't give guidance, as you know, for the next year until our investor conference. We'll give you more details then. But just we thought it was helpful because FX has been such an impact this year, and it will continue to fall over the next year that will help quantify what the top line impact will be, which we think is near what is going to be this year.  So this year, we're at like 5% of sales and about $270 million. We think maybe it gets near to that at current rates, when we forecast for 2023, but we don't have the quarter-by-quarter breakout yet. Mike, do you want to talk about next years...\nMichael Mussallem: Well, I'd just briefly just go through the portfolio. I mean, we feel like the business -- we don't talk about very much like Surgical and Critical Care are strong and are going to continue to deliver. We're going to see catalysts coming from TMTT as we see a lift coming from the introduction of PRECISION next year. And then TAVR, even though we're suffering right now from some staffing shortages, we think those are going to get gradually better. And I expect solid performance. I mean, we're not kidding when we say we still believe that there's a $10 billion opportunity in 2028. We're highly confident in that, and I think we're on a path to achieve it.\nLawrence Biegelsen: That's helpful. Mike. And actually, I wanted to ask about tricuspid. A lot of excitement around tricuspid. I know you know that you employed a Bayesian design for Class IID. Is it reasonable to assume that you'll employ a similar [indiscernible] design for your tricuspid pivotal trials, the 2 you mentioned? And just how are you thinking about that opportunity? Our check suggested it should be bigger than mitral, maybe somewhere between mitral and aortic.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Larry. We're obviously excited about our pipeline, and we work very closely with regulators around the world, including the FDA. We typically just don't comment on some of the real specifics of the regulatory process because they tend to change and be situational. And so I'm not going to really get into -- are we going to do [indiscernible] on a specific upcoming trial? I mean, we're well aware of all the tools that are available, and we'll try and do the smartest thing and work really in a legal fashion with the regulators, but it's not clear. I don't know, Bernard, do you have anything you want to add to that?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. Just a small thing. Obviously, any study, any trial has different design. Some are comparing devices together, some are comparing a device to medical treatment. So obviously, it is not as easy as taking what we did for IID and applying that to the other studies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Maybe first, I think it would be helpful. Maybe walk us through some of the differences between why TAVR so much more impacted than the Surgical business? I know it's lots of similarities but also differences. Is it just pure staffing? Is it the imaging? Is it the testing? Is it the patient pipeline? Any ideas there? And how should we think about the impact from the shortfall in Japan? It looks like numbers came in below the Street by about $15-plus million. Is that all Japan?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. So let me kick it off, Robbie, and then I'll turn to Larry and Daveen to supplement the answer. So actually, the TAVR procedures, we believe grew faster than the Surgical procedures, if you look at what the market did in the quarter. When you look at Edwards itself, it looks like the Surgical business was growing faster, but that's more Edwards-specific performance rather than what was going on in the underlying market. So I think we have to be a little cautious. Daveen, do you want to add anything from a surgical perspective? And then we'll kick it over to Larry.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, sure, Mike. I appreciate that. Yes, so to follow up what Mike was saying, Robbie, the growth driver of the Surgical business, as Mike had mentioned, was really about driving adoption of the Brazilian portfolio globally as well as the U.S. launch of our new mitral valve MITRIS, which provided a nice uplift. So RESILIA and MITRIS were really our top drivers. But as like I said, we also had a little bit of market growth coming from us -- maybe low single-digit market growth. And we're generally seeing that within the world of surgical operating rooms and surgery beyond cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery being an area that surgical operating rooms kind of prioritize resources to a surgical operating rooms. So we generally see that led to that slow-low single-digit kind of market growth.\nLarry Wood: Yes. This is Larry. As it relates to TAVR, there's more upfront work that has to happen with a TAVR patient than a surgical patient, both in terms of the imaging that has to be done, you have to do a CT for sizing. Oftentimes, you need to do angiograms to screen out for coronary disease so that you can do all of your TAVR case planning. So there's typically more workup that has to be done for a surgical patient. And so when we talk about staffing issues, a staffing issue at any link in the chain can cause patients to move a little bit slower through the system and take a little longer to recover.  So I think that's one of the differences we see. But as Mike said, procedures grew faster than surgery. So it's -- and a lot of the growth drivers in surgery, I think, go beyond aortic procedures.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. And Robbie, just to quickly comment on Japan. Yes, the total impact in the shortfall was only from COVID. COVID hit hard. I don't know how close you were to how hard it hit in Japan, but it is hard. And we are doing great in Japan, and we continue to do great in Japan. But we really felt the impact of that. It was probably worse towards the middle of the quarter, and it started getting better. So it's -- the wave is kind of passing now, if you will. So it's not continuing. But when it hit, it hit in a pretty significant way.\nRobert Marcus: That's good to know. Maybe one more follow-up question here. The OpEx control in the quarter was some of the most severe we've seen probably since and ever second and third quarter of 2020 during the worst of COVID. How should we be thinking about where these pullbacks came from -- how sustainable they are? And how fast it could pick up going forward?\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Part of this was operating with a healthy sense of discipline about making sure we're running the company efficiently. But a lot of it was just the benefit of expenses that we incur overseas that translate into lower U.S. dollars.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe my first one is, Mike, for you, specifically on U.S. TAVR. I think that $850 million Q4, what's the underlying implied TAVR? Is that low singles? And I think you mentioned 50% of centers in the U.S. grew double digits. I'm curious, is that a comment just to assure people that this market is still double-digit growing? And perhaps the remaining half of the center, you're seeing some of these staffing challenges. Just give us some context on why we're seeing double-digit growth in some centers and not in perhaps the others?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. I guess we need to check the numbers. I don't know that low single makes sense to me, Vijay. But nonetheless, let's just get into what's there, and I'll turn it over to Larry here in a second. But yes, indeed, we saw a great variance across the country in terms of how hospitals have been performing. And Larry could probably give us some color on that. But we saw some centers that were really growing significantly. We mentioned how many had double-digit growth and other centers that just weren't growing at all. But Larry, why don't you get into that a little bit.\nLarry Wood: Yes. When we looked across the country, I think anywhere we go and anybody we talk to, they talk about staffing challenges. And I think that's pretty consistent across the country. But clearly, it seems to be impacting certain areas of the country more than others. I mean, just anecdotally, [indiscernible] centers in Texas in the middle of the country that were growing very, very well. And some of our big programs and more of the urban areas, the population density areas. They were a little bit flatter. And so we do see big differences, but it actually -- it encourages me that as these things start to wane, the patients are there. And I think, again, anecdotally, we hear backlogs continue to grow, but I think there's still some challenges in working through these staffing issues.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe, Scott, one for you. I think that you have $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Why not announce a big ASR? I think your peer has done this. Just [indiscernible] market that Edwards still believes in the long-term underlying growth of TAVR markets. Clearly, there's some nervousness [indiscernible] the guide cut this evening?\nScott Ullem: Well, you're right. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. It gives us flexibility to invest for future growth. And so part of that is building additional physical infrastructure, supporting plant production capacity. Part of it is making sure that we're -- ability that we're able to fund external growth. And then yes, we're going to continue to buy back shares. And we've done accelerated share repurchases, including earlier this year. In total this year, it's been our biggest share repurchase year ever at over $800 million.  And so the only good thing about the stock price haven't been under pressure this year is it's given us a chance to go buy in shares, and we think that, that's going to be a great long-term investment. We're going to continue to look for opportunities to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Hoping to just ask about U.S. TAVR growth and potential return to the CAGR that I believe is ingrained in the $10 billion by 2028 TAM calculation. I mean do we -- do you think that U.S. TAVR return to double-digit growth requires indication expansion? Is that essential? Or could we see a return to double-digit growth prior to early TAVR opening up the asymptomatic indication and PROGRESS opening up to symptom moderate?\nMichael Mussallem: Larry, why don't you take that?\nLarry Wood: Yes. Thanks, Josh. There's -- just because of the nature of the trials and the 2-year end points that we have on these trials, they're not really big contributors to those numbers. And what drives those numbers is we still have only about 1 out of 10 patients with aortic stenosis that are getting treated in the U.S. And if you look at the penetration rates, outside the U.S., they're much smaller than that. I mean, in a lot of Rest of World places, they're just really just getting started and Japan is very undertreated.  So I think it's just a matter of getting through some of this COVID lag that we've had, getting some of the staffing a little bit healthier. And then I think it's going to return back to normal. I sort of see the indication expansion as being things that give us legs beyond the $10 billion.\nJoshua Jennings: Great. And just a follow-up on the RESILIA tissue incorporated in the SAPIEN Ultra 3 and the price premium. Can you just talk about the reception as you've marketed that in the early days? And how should we think about, I guess, the penetration of RESILIA tissue than the SAPEIN franchise in the U.S. in 2023 or in the coming quarters and into 2023?\nLarry Wood: Sure. Well, we're very fortunate that our Surgical business has built a great brand around RESILIA, and we get to follow that all of the brand work that they've been able to do. And so when you look at the Surgical side in [indiscernible], I think the leading heart valve in the world now, and that's largely based on the RESILIA tissue and how receptive people have been to the benefits that it brings. For SAPIEN 3 UR, that approval came a little bit earlier than we expected. We're super excited to add it to our SAPIEN platform.  We're really just getting started in the launch. We have to scale up inventory and do some of the other things we need to do. But I think people are excited about it. And we are going for a price premium on that. We've increased our list price by about $1,500. Now people get rebates, and there's different things around the country. So I don't know that I would model that in for everything. But I expect this is going to be a popular platform, but it's going to take us a while to get it all rolled out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: So I wanted to spend a little bit of time on hospital staffing because by our due diligence, it's getting better, but not expected to get great anytime soon. So should we think about next year TAVR growth being more high single-digit growth in the U.S. versus double-digit growth? I just want to get my head around how to think about the lingering effects of this.\nMichael Mussallem: So. I can start us out, Joanne. So you're right, we don't expect staffing to be cured overnight. It's highly variable. As Larry indicated, just by the fact that we have almost half of the U.S. hospitals in TAVR that were growing at double digits. So there's a bunch of people not really suffering from staffing. And then again, there's another large swath of people that are really suffering from it. The conversations that we have with those folks in many cases say, oh, we're making progress, it's improving.  Some say it might take them up to a year or 2 to improve it. There were probably widespread use of traveling nurses. That's had such a burden on the P&L of hospitals that they've curtailed that in long ways in many ways and been able to move beyond that. But this is going to be a process that takes some time. So does it hamper our growth next year? Probably some. I mean we do anticipate probably a tough winter, Joanne, just because of what's predicted here with COVID and the flu.  But beyond that, it's tough to say. We're going to be providing guidance at the investor conference, so you can get deep on that. And so we'll be prepared to go a little deeper at that time. Larry, you have anything to add?\nLarry Wood: Yes. I think it's important to remember, I mean, the patients are out there and they need to be treated. And the physicians are still very, very motivated to get these patients treated. And so they're frustrated as anybody else is. And I think hospitals are incentivized for doing procedures, not for not treating people. So I think everybody wants to get the situation resolved. I just think as hospitals have added staff, one of the first things they try to do, as Mike mentioned, is use the new staff to replace the traveling nurses to try to help out their own P&Ls.  And so that's maybe why we haven't seen as much lift from the staffing, but hospitals are working super hard on this to get this resolved. It's going to take time because you can't just create nurses from scratch quickly, but people are working really hard on getting this into a better place.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel,.\nFrederick Wise: A couple of follow-up questions. And I apologize, it's hard to not focus on the U.S. growth numbers. Larry -- it is actually sort of a question for Larry, really, but I'll just [indiscernible], Mike. The -- I was -- expand on your comments on the U.S. referral chain. You talked about one aspect of getting patients treated, the imaging. But has COVID or anything about the current dynamics slowed patients showing up to clinics where they can be diagnosed in some way? Or is there some aspect that we can sort of focus on and imagine that it might get better sort of at the front of the patient gathering change?  And related to that, one of the thing I still can't quite understand and wrap my brain around is to I mean, [indiscernible] stenosis are very -- patients are sick. How are they not being treated? And it's so hard to make imagine these people being in backlog. Maybe you could just talk around those points.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Why don't I start, Rick, and have Larry jump in. Yes, in the early days of the pandemic, I really do think it scared patients away from engaging in the system and getting treated. I think for the most part, we're in a different place now where the AS patients actually, they want to be treated. They're willing to go into the system, but they're just finding the system grinding along slowly. And they're being pushed off, and they're being postponed. And it's a multistep process. Maybe Larry, you can get a little bit deeper on that.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Yes. I think referrals are increasing. I mean, what we hear anecdotally is that backlogs are growing at hospitals, which would seem to indicate patients are still getting referred at least from what we hear from the physicians that we talk to. So I think that part of the system is starting to get better. But as I talked about earlier, there's just a multiple set of tests and screening and imaging that patients have to do before they get their TAVR. And I just don't think that system has come back to full health yet.  But I think we certainly have heard from centers that have said they kind of have to juggle patients with the more sick patients moving up the waiting list and then pushing the less sick patients down a little bit. But again, hopefully, this improves with time as staffing gets back to normalcy.\nFrederick Wise: One last quick follow-up. Mike, you alluded to the buildup of the TMTT commercial team. Just curious, where are we -- and maybe specifically related to the PASCAL rollout, where are we, where are you hoping to be over the next few months as we approach '23?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Rick. Yes, we're definitely building up that team, and we're growing the team in Europe as well as the U.S. So we have Bernard right here. So Bernard, why don't you update us where we are?\nBernard Zovighian: Okay. So maybe let me start with the U.S. We are obviously very pleased about having an early approval with PASCAL in the U.S. We are executing our plan, which is training and expanding our field organization. We already started to train some physicians. We are negotiating some hospital contracts. We have done some few cases in the U.S. with great patient outcome. And you know that for us, it is our #1 objective. So -- and we are initially focusing on the site that we are part of the clinical trial with us. So that's basically where we are in the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: First one is looking at the U.S. TAVR growth this quarter, and I apologize for all the questions on this topic. Looking at the larger urban centers, are those centers growing at all or at that capacity is all the new growth coming from the smaller or newer centers?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Yes, I can start. It's quite -- it's really a mixed bag, Pito. But Larry, you want to make a few comments and [indiscernible]\nLarry Wood: It really is a mixed bag. I mean certainly, some of those centers are sort of more flattish. But we also have some of those big centers that are growing actually really well. So it's just really, really hard to generalize or to make broad overreaching comments. But as we said before, probably about half of our centers were growing in double digits. And -- but I think bigger centers maybe start a little bit more than some of the smaller centers. But again, I have big centers that are growing well. I have small centers that aren't growing. So these are just sort of some general comments.\nPhilip Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. And then looking at the German market, its largest -- most mature market in Europe, and I know that's sort of been COVID throughout the year. But just curious, how is the German market growing in 2022 and any colors or where that grew specifically in the third quarter?\nMichael Mussallem: So it kind of depends what we're talking about, Pito. So if you're talking about surgery or you're talking about TAVR or you're talking about the transcatheter mitral, they each have their own growth rates. In particular, in Germany, they have been hit by COVID. We tended to see it more in the ICUs in Germany, maybe more than any other country in Europe, which tended to hurt our transcatheter mitral probably market growth a little bit more than some of the other segments. But I don't know, Larry or Bernard, do you have anything you want to add to that?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, correct, Mike. We have seen a spike in COVID wave in -- specifically in Germany, mainly in October, late September, in October. So we don't know yet how it is going to resolve. Is it going to be an acute, only October? Is it going to get better in November? That's yet to be seen.\nLarry Wood: Yes. I think generally speaking, Q3 in Europe is always a little bit tougher because we have the seasonality that we typically see with holiday vacations and those sorts of things. But we certainly have seen some challenges there, but I would say the staffing issues are a little bit more scattered there than they are in the U.S. just more widespread.\nMichael Mussallem: But having said all those things that I know sound it all sounds pretty negative. You also have great big German centers with dedicated KOLs who are really good and really motivated. They're truly global leaders and key opinion leaders. These guys are just cranking. They're just going. We probably see more energy out of them than we've ever seen in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: I wanted to ask about PASCAL, PASCAL PRECISION in Europe, really what you've seen either from further standard penetration versus expanding new centers? How you're thinking about the growth drivers going forward, the bigger growth drivers? And then just turning to U.S. as well, the 2 PASCAL trials FMR and for TR, just if you could provide an update in terms of how you're thinking about recent progress with then in enrollment as well as kind of time lines to potential approval?\nMichael Mussallem: Okay. So we'll start out by talking about precision in Europe. And then we'll also comment on your question regarding the trials. So Bernard, do you want to...\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So we began the conversion of center from PASCAL to the PASCAL PRECISION system and initial feedback from physician is very positive. And by the way, we got a great clinical outcome, patient outcome. So the physician appreciated the ease of use, the navigation improvement that the new system is bringing. So this year, we are very excited about it, even though we are at the beginning of it. So we see a lot of promise from this innovation with [indiscernible] devices. So that's [indiscernible]\nMichael Mussallem: And the other question was there any update related to the PASCAL TR or the functional patients that are being studied with PASCAL.\nBernard Zovighian: So the two -- we are continuing the [indiscernible] of these 2 pivotal studies with Class IID having completed enrollment. We believe that the sites are going to put more focus on these 2 remaining trials, but we are continuing. It is going well. And I am going to provide you a little bit more update here during the investor conference.\nMichael Mussallem: So the same trials that we're doing IID are probably doing IIF and IITR. So yes.\nBernard Zovighian: Mostly.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. And if I could just follow up really quickly your comments on EVOQUE in Europe and just the MDR process. Can you talk through what you're seeing today and really what kind of drove the about year push out, how you're thinking about just the process from your end going forward?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Thanks. We're very excited about the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system and really think that it has the potential of being a game changer, but Bernard, do you want to comment on MDR?\nBernard Zovighian: So as you know, this MDR process is a new process. And like everyone, we are navigating this new process. And this new process is uncertain, specifically for breakthrough therapies like EVOQUE. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of EVOQUE. At London Valve, you are going to see additional data with more patients, longer follow-up. And so very much looking for this one. So for sure, disappointed by not being able to have an approval this year. But we are very excited about the promise of this technology. We are working very closely with our notified body, answering questions. And so we are very much looking forward to bring this important therapy to patients who have no options today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I wanted a little more color on the TAVR guidance. It implies $850 million in Q4, which is down sequentially just wanted a better understanding of why down sequentially? And if that's a comment on both U.S. and OUS, you expect kind of both to be down quarter-over-quarter?\nScott Ullem: I'll start. Part of what we're experiencing is continuing foreign exchange headwinds. And so the $850 million incorporates sales from outside of the U.S. and in the U.S. And outside of the U.S., you've seen the euro and the yen just get weaker and weaker during the course of the year. And so that's part of what's hitting us in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. We actually expect more procedures, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Do you think -- so U.S. TAVR you expect to be up quarter-over-quarter?\nMichael Mussallem: The procedures will certainly be up. We're not prepared to predict the [indiscernible] foreign exchange.\nTravis Steed: Okay. That's more a U.S. comment. But -- and I guess follow-up. Yes, you [indiscernible]. Okay. And the follow-up question was on kind of on spending OpEx and margins for next year given some of the FX flow-through. I know the Street's got you at like 6 to 7 earnings growth next year. I just want to make sure big picture, we're accounting for all the puts and takes on the P&L as you consider models for 2023?\nScott Ullem: Yes. And again, I'm going to have to ask you to hold off for the detail on the ticking and tying until we get to New York on December 8. But we wanted to at least help you on modeling the top line and the gross margin. So top line, we're expecting, as we mentioned, similar headwinds to what we've seen this year. So call it over $200 million in headwinds. We had $270 million this year. And then you add to that lower gross margin. So we go down about 250 basis points from where we expect the full year this year, which would take you to 77.5% just from a modeling perspective.  So the combination of those 2 things, flowing down the P&L should get you to at least a preliminary range of what to expect earnings per share. And like I said, we'll talk more about [indiscernible]\nMichael Mussallem: Yes. Well, we had an inflated gross margin this year because of the impact of hedge contracts, and that will largely go away.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: I just wanted to come back to a couple of points that you guys made about certain trends related to flu and COVID and then Japan specifically, just to be sure about what's getting better, what's just not getting worse and then what is getting worse into 4Q? And then you keep saying the winter months, it sounds like the early part of '23. So can you clarify what exactly you say, flu and COVID picking up being a tough winter? What regions? I want to make sure I understand where and what's factored into the guidance for that? And the same question on Japan, it sounds like that was getting a little better, you're through the worst of it, but what's assumed in guidance specifically into 4Q? And how should we think beyond that?\nMichael Mussallem: All right. So there's several questions in there. Let's see if I'll take a shot at getting after a few of them. First, let me start with the end here. In Japan, we said, yes, Japan, we believe, is getting better. The seventh wave has peaked and is coming down. Will they have another wave in Japan? I don't know. Very difficult to say. We'd say, generally, the intelligence, and this is particularly U.S. and Europe oriented, is that we expect it to be a rugged COVID and flu season.  And that -- we haven't fully experienced that yet that, that's probably more expected to come in November through January time frame. So yes, your question of could that also affect early 2023? Yes, it could. And some of this is just from the experience that we have all had around the world and a number of predictions about what's likely to happen based on the current variance. So I don't know, does that get that answer your question?\nRichard Newitter: Yes. And I guess, what's assumed for that in your guide, did you assume that, that gets worse into the fourth quarter already?\nScott Ullem: Rich, we assumed it in our guidance. And so there is an appropriate amount of expectation, and I guess, conservatism that we are expecting continuing headwinds from respiratory illnesses, whether it's COVID or flu or something in between, we expect that that's going to continue to play a factor in the fourth quarter and into 2023.\nRichard Newitter: And if I could just 1 more. On I know that the -- that you said a 250 basis point year-over-year headwind. So that's clear. But as FX rates continue to go against you, I know that, that also pushes out the hedge impact into next year. So would that actually cause there to be a little bit even of a further pushout into '24 and maybe less or more mitigation of that falloff in '23? Am I thinking about that right?\nScott Ullem: You are thinking about that right. Some of what we're seeing -- a lot of what we're seeing in 2023 is what we would have otherwise incurred in 2022. And similarly, we're going to see some FX benefit in the first part of there will then be a headwind in 2024.\nMichael Mussallem: All assumes that exchange rate stay where they are.\nScott Ullem: Yes, assumes current rate, exactly. I just want to clarify one thing. It's a 250 basis point headwind to gross margin, it's nearly a 5 percentage point headwind on the top line.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.\nAdam Maeder: Just two quick ones from me. First, just any update on the enrollment for the moderate AS trial or ALLIANCE trial? I think if I heard correctly, there's -- you saw some uptick in enrollment pace recently, but I was hoping you could flesh that out a little bit more? And then second, how should we be thinking about the cadence of future data from the PASCAL IID study? Obviously, we got the initial data set at TCT, but when should we expect additional readouts from that study?\nLarry Wood: All right. This is Larry. So as it relates to ALLIANCE and PROGRESS, we just really got those trials going this year. And we have seen an acceleration in enrollment, which is really encouraging for us to get these trials moving forward. And given the overall environment, you worry that clinical trials just really add on, and it's a little bit counterintuitive, but our trials are actually starting to enroll at accelerated rates. And so we're very encouraged by that. And I think people are excited about the X4 platform.  And I think the moderate AS trial is potentially a groundbreaking trial in terms of how we think about this disease and what is the optimal way to treat it. And I think there's just been a lot of engagement from the physicians to study that in a rigorous randomized trial.\nMichael Mussallem: And Adam, your question about additional IID readouts is a good one. So far, this has really been an early readout of the Class IID, which was sufficient to get U.S. approval, but as we follow all of the patients in this trial for the full year, there will be additional data. Bernard, do you want to give us a sense of when that data might be available?\nBernard Zovighian: Absolutely. You can expect to see additional data, more patients, more follow-up starting as early as next year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions. I'll now hand the floor back to Mike Mussallem for closing remarks.\nMichael Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and the IR team and I certainly welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Mussallem",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. The third quarter strengthened our conviction in our company's patient-focused innovation strategy. Globally, structural heart procedures grew less than we expected in the third quarter, but that didn't slow us down, as our team accomplished numerous important milestones and made good progress on our multiple clinical trials and next-generation technologies. In August, we received European regulatory approval for PASCAL PRECISION. This unique system is designed for transcatheter-based edge-to-edge leaflet repair in patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  Shortly thereafter, in September, we received early U.S. FDA approval for PASCAL PRECISION for the treatment of patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation, which was welcome news for clinicians who appreciate this differentiated platform. And in TAVR, last month, we announced approval to begin selling the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the U.S. our industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter aortic heart valve now incorporates Edwards' breakthrough RESILIA technology. Additionally, during the third quarter, enrollment accelerated in our 2 TAVR pivotal trials, progress evaluating patients with moderate AS and Alliance for our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.  These transformative developments reinforce our confidence in the continued growth of transcatheter-based structural heart inventive. We will continue to aggressively pursue breakthrough technologies with the potential to help even a broader group of patients and in turn drive significant future value. Now turning to our financial performance. Third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Our broad portfolio of innovative technologies drove this growth, although it was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan.  Adjusted EPS grew 13% even while aggressively investing in R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies. For full year 2022, we expect total Edwards sales will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange and be at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We anticipate hospital staffing challenges and a predictive difficult winter COVID and flu season will continue into next year. In TAVR, third quarter global sales of $862 million increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Sales were below our expectations due primarily to the persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan, which intensified the typical impact of summer seasonality.  In the third quarter, we're pleased that well over 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN across our more than 2,000 global TAVR centers. We estimate that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the third quarter. Local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined due to the weakening euro and yen. In the U.S., our TAVR procedures increased in the mid-single digits versus the prior year. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.  As expected, our third quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes continued to be impacted by regional U.S. staffing constraints, which were somewhat worse than we anticipated. There were a high level of variability in growth rates across centers around the country. And while staffing issues limited overall growth during the quarter, nearly half of our TAVR centers grew double digit in Q3. Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our TAVR sales grew in the low double digits on a constant currency basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable.  Our underlying 3-year compounded annual growth rate outside the U.S. remains in the mid-teens. In Q3, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low. In Europe, sales were down sequentially as expected, even though we compete with a broad range of competitors, our competitive position remains stable. Scattered staffing shortages slightly exacerbated summer seasonality, and we anticipate some lingering regional impact on that.  In Japan, third quarter procedure growth was impacted by a widespread seventh wave of COVID, which created a significant strain on hospital capacity and limited TAVR procedure volumes. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 varied across the country as patients and the providers were incentivized to turn their focus again to the treatment of patients with COVID. We saw TAVR procedure volumes improve as COVID hospitalizations decreased late in the third quarter. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.  In summary, we anticipate the continuation of staffing shortages and a difficult winter, COVID and flu season. We expect Q4 TAVR sales to be around $850 million and full year 2022 TAVR sales to be at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We remain confident about the long-term potential of TAVR as the rapidly evolving evidence recognized by policymakers around the world supports continued adoption of this therapy for the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis.  This broad-based, favorable evidence, combined with the undertreatment rate and growing elderly population supports our expectation that this global TAVR opportunity will reach $10 billion by 2028, which implies a low double-digit compounded annual growth rate. Turning now to our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies product group. Recently, we received U.S. FDA and European CE Mark approval of PASCAL PRECISION. This next-generation system designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience will enable us to initiate our commercial presence in the U.S. for the treatment of patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation and also expand PASCAL adoption in Europe for both mitral and tricuspid patients.  This exciting news was followed by the presentation of first results from the Class IID pivotal trial at the recent TCT conference. This first-of-a-kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial further established the safety and efficacy of mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. We were pleased that this data demonstrated that PASCAL is a beneficial therapy expanding transcatheter treatment options for DMR patients. In addition, we continue to advance enrollment of our Class IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation.  Separately, we continue to treat patients with our 2 transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. We are pleased with our progress and believe these sub-30 French transfemoral therapies will help transform treatment for patients and expand the mitral opportunity. Turning to tricuspid. We continue to make progress enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement system and the Class IIR pivotal trial with the PASCAL repair system in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We no longer anticipate CE Mark approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe this year.  As uncertainties remain around the MDR process, we now expect a CE Mark approval late in 2023, with sales contribution in 2024 when we expect to have reimbursement in place. We're excited about this therapy for the many tricuspid patients who have few treatment options today. Looking ahead to PCR London Valves conference in November, we expect numerous late-breaking data presentations across the TMTT portfolio. Especially noteworthy is new 1-year follow-up data on our early experience with the EVOQUE tricuspid valve.  We expect these presentations to contribute positively to the growing body of compelling clinical evidence for our comprehensive portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Third quarter sales of $30 million grew sequentially from the second quarter despite summer seasonality. Adoption of the PASCAL system in Europe increased as we initiated a limited introduction of PASCAL PRECISION, and we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients as we progress on a gradual expansion into more centers in Europe. We forecast to increase the number of procedures in Q4, yet expect reported Q4 sales to be similar to Q3 as a result of FX headwinds and a spike in COVID in Germany, our largest region in Europe.  We're pleased with our continued progress to our bring portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales of $220 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite staffing challenges in certain regions.  And although staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we're observing that cardiac surgeries are being prioritized. We continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally as we bolster the overall body of evidence, including 4 abstracts recently presented at the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Annual Meeting in Milan. We continue to believe that physicians value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. Adoption of the MITRIS valve launched in the U.S. in April now represents the majority of our mitral valve sales in this region.  Separately, we've decided to exit our HARPOON surgical mitral repair system and stop enrollment in the related clinical trials. Given our experience to date, we made the difficult decision to focus on developing other innovative therapies to better serve patients and continue to be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and surgical market growth.  In Critical Care, third quarter sales of $207 million increased 3% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. The growth rate was impacted by a very strong prior year comparison. Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of our broad portfolio of smart recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm. Additionally, demand for our HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for the full year 2022. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make even more informed decisions for patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. Well, despite ongoing procedure headwinds associated with the pandemic, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance, which includes strong progress on strategic milestones. We believe hospital staffing constraints will gradually improve and are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy for the broad group of patients still suffering from structural heart disease. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will allow us to treat more patients and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Well, I'd just briefly just go through the portfolio. I mean, we feel like the business -- we don't talk about very much like Surgical and Critical Care are strong and are going to continue to deliver. We're going to see catalysts coming from TMTT as we see a lift coming from the introduction of PRECISION next year. And then TAVR, even though we're suffering right now from some staffing shortages, we think those are going to get gradually better. And I expect solid performance. I mean, we're not kidding when we say we still believe that there's a $10 billion opportunity in 2028. We're highly confident in that, and I think we're on a path to achieve it. Yes. Thanks, Larry. We're obviously excited about our pipeline, and we work very closely with regulators around the world, including the FDA. We typically just don't comment on some of the real specifics of the regulatory process because they tend to change and be situational. And so I'm not going to really get into -- are we going to do [indiscernible] on a specific upcoming trial? I mean, we're well aware of all the tools that are available, and we'll try and do the smartest thing and work really in a legal fashion with the regulators, but it's not clear. I don't know, Bernard, do you have anything you want to add to that? Yes. So let me kick it off, Robbie, and then I'll turn to Larry and Daveen to supplement the answer. So actually, the TAVR procedures, we believe grew faster than the Surgical procedures, if you look at what the market did in the quarter. When you look at Edwards itself, it looks like the Surgical business was growing faster, but that's more Edwards-specific performance rather than what was going on in the underlying market. So I think we have to be a little cautious. Daveen, do you want to add anything from a surgical perspective? And then we'll kick it over to Larry. Yes. And Robbie, just to quickly comment on Japan. Yes, the total impact in the shortfall was only from COVID. COVID hit hard. I don't know how close you were to how hard it hit in Japan, but it is hard. And we are doing great in Japan, and we continue to do great in Japan. But we really felt the impact of that. It was probably worse towards the middle of the quarter, and it started getting better. So it's -- the wave is kind of passing now, if you will. So it's not continuing. But when it hit, it hit in a pretty significant way. Yes. I guess we need to check the numbers. I don't know that low single makes sense to me, Vijay. But nonetheless, let's just get into what's there, and I'll turn it over to Larry here in a second. But yes, indeed, we saw a great variance across the country in terms of how hospitals have been performing. And Larry could probably give us some color on that. But we saw some centers that were really growing significantly. We mentioned how many had double-digit growth and other centers that just weren't growing at all. But Larry, why don't you get into that a little bit. Larry, why don't you take that? So. I can start us out, Joanne. So you're right, we don't expect staffing to be cured overnight. It's highly variable. As Larry indicated, just by the fact that we have almost half of the U.S. hospitals in TAVR that were growing at double digits. So there's a bunch of people not really suffering from staffing. And then again, there's another large swath of people that are really suffering from it. The conversations that we have with those folks in many cases say, oh, we're making progress, it's improving.  Some say it might take them up to a year or 2 to improve it. There were probably widespread use of traveling nurses. That's had such a burden on the P&L of hospitals that they've curtailed that in long ways in many ways and been able to move beyond that. But this is going to be a process that takes some time. So does it hamper our growth next year? Probably some. I mean we do anticipate probably a tough winter, Joanne, just because of what's predicted here with COVID and the flu.  But beyond that, it's tough to say. We're going to be providing guidance at the investor conference, so you can get deep on that. And so we'll be prepared to go a little deeper at that time. Larry, you have anything to add? Yes. Why don't I start, Rick, and have Larry jump in. Yes, in the early days of the pandemic, I really do think it scared patients away from engaging in the system and getting treated. I think for the most part, we're in a different place now where the AS patients actually, they want to be treated. They're willing to go into the system, but they're just finding the system grinding along slowly. And they're being pushed off, and they're being postponed. And it's a multistep process. Maybe Larry, you can get a little bit deeper on that. Yes. Thanks, Rick. Yes, we're definitely building up that team, and we're growing the team in Europe as well as the U.S. So we have Bernard right here. So Bernard, why don't you update us where we are? Yes. Yes, I can start. It's quite -- it's really a mixed bag, Pito. But Larry, you want to make a few comments and [indiscernible] So it kind of depends what we're talking about, Pito. So if you're talking about surgery or you're talking about TAVR or you're talking about the transcatheter mitral, they each have their own growth rates. In particular, in Germany, they have been hit by COVID. We tended to see it more in the ICUs in Germany, maybe more than any other country in Europe, which tended to hurt our transcatheter mitral probably market growth a little bit more than some of the other segments. But I don't know, Larry or Bernard, do you have anything you want to add to that? But having said all those things that I know sound it all sounds pretty negative. You also have great big German centers with dedicated KOLs who are really good and really motivated. They're truly global leaders and key opinion leaders. These guys are just cranking. They're just going. We probably see more energy out of them than we've ever seen in the past. Okay. So we'll start out by talking about precision in Europe. And then we'll also comment on your question regarding the trials. So Bernard, do you want to... And the other question was there any update related to the PASCAL TR or the functional patients that are being studied with PASCAL. So the same trials that we're doing IID are probably doing IIF and IITR. So yes. Yes. Thanks. We're very excited about the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system and really think that it has the potential of being a game changer, but Bernard, do you want to comment on MDR? Yes. We actually expect more procedures, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The procedures will certainly be up. We're not prepared to predict the [indiscernible] foreign exchange. Yes. Well, we had an inflated gross margin this year because of the impact of hedge contracts, and that will largely go away. All right. So there's several questions in there. Let's see if I'll take a shot at getting after a few of them. First, let me start with the end here. In Japan, we said, yes, Japan, we believe, is getting better. The seventh wave has peaked and is coming down. Will they have another wave in Japan? I don't know. Very difficult to say. We'd say, generally, the intelligence, and this is particularly U.S. and Europe oriented, is that we expect it to be a rugged COVID and flu season.  And that -- we haven't fully experienced that yet that, that's probably more expected to come in November through January time frame. So yes, your question of could that also affect early 2023? Yes, it could. And some of this is just from the experience that we have all had around the world and a number of predictions about what's likely to happen based on the current variance. So I don't know, does that get that answer your question? All assumes that exchange rate stay where they are. And Adam, your question about additional IID readouts is a good one. So far, this has really been an early readout of the Class IID, which was sufficient to get U.S. approval, but as we follow all of the patients in this trial for the full year, there will be additional data. Bernard, do you want to give us a sense of when that data might be available? Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and the IR team and I certainly welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.32 billion in the quarter, representing growth of 6.7% on a constant currency basis, fell short of our expectations, driven by a slower-than-expected recovery of U.S. hospital staffing and COVID in Japan. Our strong underlying gross profit margin combined with a minimal spending increase resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to $0.61. GAAP EPS was $0.55, which included a net $57 million pretax charge or $0.07 per share related to the HARPOON discontinuation.  We anticipate that the U.S. hospital staffing challenge is likely to persist, and we now expect total company sales at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. And TAVR sales also at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million, and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For the fourth quarter, we're projecting sales and adjusted earnings per share to be similar to Q3.  We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, up from 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.22. I'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the third quarter was 81.0% compared to 76.3% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our foreign exchange program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar.  At current FX rates, we continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be approximately 80%. This year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange as compared to 2021. At current rates, FX is expected to result in an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit and operating margins in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter increased 3.5% over the prior year to $377 million or 28.6% of sales primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team.  Research and development expenses in the quarter declined 2% over the prior year to $234 million or 17.7% of sales. The decline reflects unusually high year ago spending. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2022 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. The discontinuation of our surgical HARPOON program resulted in a net $0.07 per share charge consisting of a noncash impairment of intangible assets, a reduction of contingent liabilities and other related exit costs.  Additional details of the charge and a reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS is included with today's release. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 15.7% or 17% excluding the impact of special items. This quarter's higher rate reflected a lower benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our 11% to 15% range. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 6 percentage points or $74 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we estimate a year-over-year FX impact to fourth quarter sales of more than $100 million.  In total, we now expect an approximate $270 million negative impact or 5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, and we expect nearly the same negative impact to full year 2023 sales. FX rates positively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 440 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $250 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $310 million, less capital spending of $60 million.  So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were $625 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $100 million. Year-to-date, through the end of Q3, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $861 million.  We expect shares at the end of the year will be slightly below our previous $625 million to $630 million share range. We now have $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. And with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike. So Larry, it's Scott. Why don't I start with the financial piece of that and then turn it over to Mike to talk about some of the strategic things that we expect in 2023. Financially, we haven't gotten into the quarter-by-quarter FX impact or growth rates. Typically, we don't give guidance, as you know, for the next year until our investor conference. We'll give you more details then. But just we thought it was helpful because FX has been such an impact this year, and it will continue to fall over the next year that will help quantify what the top line impact will be, which we think is near what is going to be this year.  So this year, we're at like 5% of sales and about $270 million. We think maybe it gets near to that at current rates, when we forecast for 2023, but we don't have the quarter-by-quarter breakout yet. Mike, do you want to talk about next years... Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Part of this was operating with a healthy sense of discipline about making sure we're running the company efficiently. But a lot of it was just the benefit of expenses that we incur overseas that translate into lower U.S. dollars. Well, you're right. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. It gives us flexibility to invest for future growth. And so part of that is building additional physical infrastructure, supporting plant production capacity. Part of it is making sure that we're -- ability that we're able to fund external growth. And then yes, we're going to continue to buy back shares. And we've done accelerated share repurchases, including earlier this year. In total this year, it's been our biggest share repurchase year ever at over $800 million.  And so the only good thing about the stock price haven't been under pressure this year is it's given us a chance to go buy in shares, and we think that, that's going to be a great long-term investment. We're going to continue to look for opportunities to do that. I'll start. Part of what we're experiencing is continuing foreign exchange headwinds. And so the $850 million incorporates sales from outside of the U.S. and in the U.S. And outside of the U.S., you've seen the euro and the yen just get weaker and weaker during the course of the year. And so that's part of what's hitting us in the fourth quarter. Yes. And again, I'm going to have to ask you to hold off for the detail on the ticking and tying until we get to New York on December 8. But we wanted to at least help you on modeling the top line and the gross margin. So top line, we're expecting, as we mentioned, similar headwinds to what we've seen this year. So call it over $200 million in headwinds. We had $270 million this year. And then you add to that lower gross margin. So we go down about 250 basis points from where we expect the full year this year, which would take you to 77.5% just from a modeling perspective.  So the combination of those 2 things, flowing down the P&L should get you to at least a preliminary range of what to expect earnings per share. And like I said, we'll talk more about [indiscernible] Rich, we assumed it in our guidance. And so there is an appropriate amount of expectation, and I guess, conservatism that we are expecting continuing headwinds from respiratory illnesses, whether it's COVID or flu or something in between, we expect that that's going to continue to play a factor in the fourth quarter and into 2023. You are thinking about that right. Some of what we're seeing -- a lot of what we're seeing in 2023 is what we would have otherwise incurred in 2022. And similarly, we're going to see some FX benefit in the first part of there will then be a headwind in 2024. Yes, assumes current rate, exactly. I just want to clarify one thing. It's a 250 basis point headwind to gross margin, it's nearly a 5 percentage point headwind on the top line."

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Yes. This is Larry. As it relates to TAVR, there's more upfront work that has to happen with a TAVR patient than a surgical patient, both in terms of the imaging that has to be done, you have to do a CT for sizing. Oftentimes, you need to do angiograms to screen out for coronary disease so that you can do all of your TAVR case planning. So there's typically more workup that has to be done for a surgical patient. And so when we talk about staffing issues, a staffing issue at any link in the chain can cause patients to move a little bit slower through the system and take a little longer to recover.  So I think that's one of the differences we see. But as Mike said, procedures grew faster than surgery. So it's -- and a lot of the growth drivers in surgery, I think, go beyond aortic procedures. Yes. When we looked across the country, I think anywhere we go and anybody we talk to, they talk about staffing challenges. And I think that's pretty consistent across the country. But clearly, it seems to be impacting certain areas of the country more than others. I mean, just anecdotally, [indiscernible] centers in Texas in the middle of the country that were growing very, very well. And some of our big programs and more of the urban areas, the population density areas. They were a little bit flatter. And so we do see big differences, but it actually -- it encourages me that as these things start to wane, the patients are there. And I think, again, anecdotally, we hear backlogs continue to grow, but I think there's still some challenges in working through these staffing issues. Yes. Thanks, Josh. There's -- just because of the nature of the trials and the 2-year end points that we have on these trials, they're not really big contributors to those numbers. And what drives those numbers is we still have only about 1 out of 10 patients with aortic stenosis that are getting treated in the U.S. And if you look at the penetration rates, outside the U.S., they're much smaller than that. I mean, in a lot of Rest of World places, they're just really just getting started and Japan is very undertreated.  So I think it's just a matter of getting through some of this COVID lag that we've had, getting some of the staffing a little bit healthier. And then I think it's going to return back to normal. I sort of see the indication expansion as being things that give us legs beyond the $10 billion. Sure. Well, we're very fortunate that our Surgical business has built a great brand around RESILIA, and we get to follow that all of the brand work that they've been able to do. And so when you look at the Surgical side in [indiscernible], I think the leading heart valve in the world now, and that's largely based on the RESILIA tissue and how receptive people have been to the benefits that it brings. For SAPIEN 3 UR, that approval came a little bit earlier than we expected. We're super excited to add it to our SAPIEN platform.  We're really just getting started in the launch. We have to scale up inventory and do some of the other things we need to do. But I think people are excited about it. And we are going for a price premium on that. We've increased our list price by about $1,500. Now people get rebates, and there's different things around the country. So I don't know that I would model that in for everything. But I expect this is going to be a popular platform, but it's going to take us a while to get it all rolled out. Yes. I think it's important to remember, I mean, the patients are out there and they need to be treated. And the physicians are still very, very motivated to get these patients treated. And so they're frustrated as anybody else is. And I think hospitals are incentivized for doing procedures, not for not treating people. So I think everybody wants to get the situation resolved. I just think as hospitals have added staff, one of the first things they try to do, as Mike mentioned, is use the new staff to replace the traveling nurses to try to help out their own P&Ls.  And so that's maybe why we haven't seen as much lift from the staffing, but hospitals are working super hard on this to get this resolved. It's going to take time because you can't just create nurses from scratch quickly, but people are working really hard on getting this into a better place. Sure. Yes. I think referrals are increasing. I mean, what we hear anecdotally is that backlogs are growing at hospitals, which would seem to indicate patients are still getting referred at least from what we hear from the physicians that we talk to. So I think that part of the system is starting to get better. But as I talked about earlier, there's just a multiple set of tests and screening and imaging that patients have to do before they get their TAVR. And I just don't think that system has come back to full health yet.  But I think we certainly have heard from centers that have said they kind of have to juggle patients with the more sick patients moving up the waiting list and then pushing the less sick patients down a little bit. But again, hopefully, this improves with time as staffing gets back to normalcy. It really is a mixed bag. I mean certainly, some of those centers are sort of more flattish. But we also have some of those big centers that are growing actually really well. So it's just really, really hard to generalize or to make broad overreaching comments. But as we said before, probably about half of our centers were growing in double digits. And -- but I think bigger centers maybe start a little bit more than some of the smaller centers. But again, I have big centers that are growing well. I have small centers that aren't growing. So these are just sort of some general comments. Yes. I think generally speaking, Q3 in Europe is always a little bit tougher because we have the seasonality that we typically see with holiday vacations and those sorts of things. But we certainly have seen some challenges there, but I would say the staffing issues are a little bit more scattered there than they are in the U.S. just more widespread. All right. This is Larry. So as it relates to ALLIANCE and PROGRESS, we just really got those trials going this year. And we have seen an acceleration in enrollment, which is really encouraging for us to get these trials moving forward. And given the overall environment, you worry that clinical trials just really add on, and it's a little bit counterintuitive, but our trials are actually starting to enroll at accelerated rates. And so we're very encouraged by that. And I think people are excited about the X4 platform.  And I think the moderate AS trial is potentially a groundbreaking trial in terms of how we think about this disease and what is the optimal way to treat it. And I think there's just been a lot of engagement from the physicians to study that in a rigorous randomized trial."

            "content": "Yes, sure, Mike. I appreciate that. Yes, so to follow up what Mike was saying, Robbie, the growth driver of the Surgical business, as Mike had mentioned, was really about driving adoption of the Brazilian portfolio globally as well as the U.S. launch of our new mitral valve MITRIS, which provided a nice uplift. So RESILIA and MITRIS were really our top drivers. But as like I said, we also had a little bit of market growth coming from us -- maybe low single-digit market growth. And we're generally seeing that within the world of surgical operating rooms and surgery beyond cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery being an area that surgical operating rooms kind of prioritize resources to a surgical operating rooms. So we generally see that led to that slow-low single-digit kind of market growth."

            "content": "Yes. Just a small thing. Obviously, any study, any trial has different design. Some are comparing devices together, some are comparing a device to medical treatment. So obviously, it is not as easy as taking what we did for IID and applying that to the other studies. Okay. So maybe let me start with the U.S. We are obviously very pleased about having an early approval with PASCAL in the U.S. We are executing our plan, which is training and expanding our field organization. We already started to train some physicians. We are negotiating some hospital contracts. We have done some few cases in the U.S. with great patient outcome. And you know that for us, it is our #1 objective. So -- and we are initially focusing on the site that we are part of the clinical trial with us. So that's basically where we are in the U.S. Yes, correct, Mike. We have seen a spike in COVID wave in -- specifically in Germany, mainly in October, late September, in October. So we don't know yet how it is going to resolve. Is it going to be an acute, only October? Is it going to get better in November? That's yet to be seen. Yes. So we began the conversion of center from PASCAL to the PASCAL PRECISION system and initial feedback from physician is very positive. And by the way, we got a great clinical outcome, patient outcome. So the physician appreciated the ease of use, the navigation improvement that the new system is bringing. So this year, we are very excited about it, even though we are at the beginning of it. So we see a lot of promise from this innovation with [indiscernible] devices. So that's [indiscernible] So the two -- we are continuing the [indiscernible] of these 2 pivotal studies with Class IID having completed enrollment. We believe that the sites are going to put more focus on these 2 remaining trials, but we are continuing. It is going well. And I am going to provide you a little bit more update here during the investor conference. Mostly. So as you know, this MDR process is a new process. And like everyone, we are navigating this new process. And this new process is uncertain, specifically for breakthrough therapies like EVOQUE. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of EVOQUE. At London Valve, you are going to see additional data with more patients, longer follow-up. And so very much looking for this one. So for sure, disappointed by not being able to have an approval this year. But we are very excited about the promise of this technology. We are working very closely with our notified body, answering questions. And so we are very much looking forward to bring this important therapy to patients who have no options today. Absolutely. You can expect to see additional data, more patients, more follow-up starting as early as next year."

With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thanks Mark. In the second quarter, total company sales reflected year-over-year and sequential growth across all four of our product groups on a constant currency basis, despite several challenging factors. Sales were lifted by strong performance outside the U.S. with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan. On a constant currency basis, total company sales grew 5% compared to the extraordinary second quarter of 2021 when sales increased 44% lifted by the treatment of patients who had postponed their care. Nevertheless, second quarter sales and EPS were at the lower end of our expectations as a result of U.S. hospitals struggling with staffing shortages as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. We now anticipate that these challenges are likely to persist throughout 2022. And as a result, we are lowering our second half outlook to more realistically reflect the current operating environment. Although, the near-term environment remains uncertain, we are unwavering in our long-term pursuit of groundbreaking innovations. We're investing to achieve breakthrough therapies that create significant value for patients in the healthcare systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. We continue to make meaningful progress on our pipeline and expect to achieve important milestones by year-end. As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we continue to believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028. Now, turning to the quarterly results by product group, in TAVR, second quarter global sales of $907 million increased 5% on an underlying basis, despite approximately 50% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our expectations due to the ongoing U.S. hospital staffing constraints and foreign exchange headwinds, but still represented our highest quarter of TAVR sales. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards, growth in the second quarter. In general, local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined slightly due to the weakening euro and yen. In Q2, we continued to advance two pivotal trials aiming to expand indications. First, our EARLY TAVR trial is studying the large group of patients with severe aortic stenosis and no diagnosed symptoms. Second, our PROGRESS trial is evaluating patients with moderate AS, which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. And last month, we also began treating patients in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next-generation SAPIEN X4. In the U.S. our TAVR sales were approximately flat with the elevated prior year but increased in the high single-digit range sequentially. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, our second quarter U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by slower-than-expected improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages. Also recall in Q2 of last year, our U.S. TAVR sales increased over 50% on a year-over-year basis, as COVID vaccines became more widely available and patients who had waited were treated. On a three-year compounded annual basis, our U.S. TAVR sales increased 10% compared to the strong second quarter in 2019. Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedural growth was comparable. This strong growth outside the U.S. was consistent with our underlying three-year compounded annual growth rate also in the mid-teens. Long term, we see excellent opportunities, for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. In Europe, Edwards, sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We estimate that our competitive position was stable. Localized hospital staffing disruptions impacted second quarter results, although this headwind was less pronounced than in the U.S. 15 years after commercialization, it's encouraging to see the resilience of the TAVR programs in Europe, despite the challenging backdrop of today's environment. In Japan, we experienced continued strong TAVR adoption as we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Similar to last quarter, the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement following approval last year for patients at low surgical risk. In summary, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. Recall that we had previously assumed an improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing shortages throughout the year. We're now anticipating a slower improvement. And as a result, we are adjusting our full year outlook. We expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 10% in full year 2022 versus the previous expectation for 12% to 15%. Longer term, we remain confident in this large global opportunity and that it will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Now, turning to TMTT. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity for mitral and tricuspid patients, we remain focused on three key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies; positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. At the TCT conference in September, we expect the first results of the Class IID pivotal trial evaluating patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation. This is -- this first of its kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial, powered for non-inferiority, will be the first of several key pivotal trials evaluating the PASCAL technology. Additionally, at TCT, we expect three-year data from the earlier class study. This growing contemporary body of clinical evidence will be important for the physician community considering transcatheter edge-to-edge repair treatments for mitral patients. We remain on track for U.S. FDA approval and CE Mark approval of PASCAL precision by year end. This next-generation system is designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience, extending our differentiated platform. This will allow us to expand PASCAL adoption in Europe, and we're pleased that we'll be launching the newest generation of PASCAL in the U.S. In mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the in-circle pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE EOS. Growing evidence with these Sub 30-French transfemoral therapies furthers our confidence in both platforms. Turning to tricuspid. We also continue to make progress on enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE replacement system and the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. While we remain hopeful for year-end approval in Europe, uncertainties exist regarding the new MDR approval process for novel technologies seeking a CE Mark. We remain committed to bringing the EVOQUE therapy to these tricuspid patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. As we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we're pleased with the recent data from several late-breaking presentations. One year results from our CLASS TR study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference demonstrated significantly reduced TR, improved quality of life and maintain TR reduction. Also at the EuroPCR meeting, 30-day post-market data from our tri-class study was presented with 90% of the patients showing improvements in their quality of life. At upcoming medical conferences this year, we plan for contemporary evidence to be presented on both our PASCAL and EVOQUE platforms. Turning to results. Second quarter global sales were $28 million, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform and activation of more centers across Europe. Our Q2 commercial performance was tempered by lower-than-expected market growth related primarily to COVID headwinds We are now updating our full year guidance to $110 to $140 million, which represents approximately 60% underlying growth over the prior year and reflects a stronger-than-anticipated impact from foreign exchange as the vast majority of TMTT's business is in Europe.  Bigger picture, we continue to be pleased with our progress forward on three key value drivers. We're advancing our comprehensive portfolio of differentiated therapies combined with contemporary clinical evidence and favorable real-world patient outcomes. Together, this demonstrates the promise of these therapies for this significant unmet patient need and will help unlock this large market potential. In Surgical Structural Heart, second quarter 2022 global sales of $229 million increased 2% on an underlying basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see global growth despite sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products as well as the COVID shutdown in China, which combined growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our growth continues to be driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products. We've seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. since its initial launch in April. Building on the commercial success of INSPIRIS, we believe hospitals value the intuitive product features as well as the benefits of this innovative RESILIA tissue technology. Physician feedback in regions where MITRIS has been launched has been positive and initial clinical outcomes have been favorable. In the second quarter, we continued to bolster the overall body of RESILIA evidence. This includes a commenced trial sub-analysis, which demonstrated the excellent performance of this tissue technology when treating bicuspid aortic valve disease, which was presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons in May. In a cohort of more than 200 patients averaging a relatively young 60 years of age, structural valve deterioration was zero at five years. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and global surgical market growth. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $211 million increased 3% on an underlying basis. As expected, growth was moderated by strong prior year comparisons. Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of our hypotension prediction index algorithm and our broad portfolio of sensors. Additionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI Smart BP trial focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support further adoption. Demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth in 2022. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions for their patients. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Okay. Thanks Mike. Despite several challenging factors, best hospital staffing and foreign exchange headwinds, our business fundamentals remain strong. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.37 billion with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan. We expected our underlying growth in the second quarter would be our lowest of the year, given our strong prior year sales performance. Our higher than expected gross profit margin lifted by the positive impact from our foreign exchange program, contributed to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. We are adjusting our guidance to more accurately reflect the continuation of the more pronounced FX headwinds and slower than expected improvement in COVID-related hospital staffing. We expect total company underlying sales growth of approximately 10% in the second half of this year. For full year 2022, we now expect total Edwards sales of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We expect TAVR sales of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion; for TMTT, $110 million to $140 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care, $8 20 million to $900 million. Now expect full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the bottom end of our original guidance range of $2.50 to $2.65. For the third quarter, we're projecting sales to be between $1.30 billion and $1.37 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.66. I'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the second quarter was 80.5% compared to 75.9% in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by the higher than expected positive impact from our FX program, which includes natural hedges and hedge contract gains that offset the sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen versus the dollar. At current foreign exchange rates, we now expect our full year and second half 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to increase to approximately 80%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from FX hedge gains and an improved product mix partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures. This year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange versus 2021. At current FX rates, in 2023, we expect an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $409 million or 29.8% of sales, primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30%, as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 11% compared to the same period last year to $251 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including eight currently enrolling pivotal clinical trials. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. During the second quarter, we recorded a $21 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. This reflects an accounting adjustment from assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for previous acquisition. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.5% or 12.9%, excluding the impact of special items. Due to last quarter's new regulations that potentially limit the amount of our foreign tax credits, combined with an estimated reduced tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our previous 11% to 15% range. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 4.6 percentage points or $60 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $250 million negative impact or 4.5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, of which approximately $170 million impacts the second half of the year. FX rates positively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. We mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit resulting in a minimal impact to the bottom-line in the calendar year. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $289 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $332 million less capital spending of $43 million. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30th, 2022. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were $627 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 3.7 million shares during the second quarter for $355 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 7.3 million shares. In July, we obtained Board approval to increase the authorization under our share repurchase program consistent with our long-time practice of seeking new authorization when the prior authorization has been diminished. We now have $1.9 billion remaining under the program. Given our repurchase activity in the first half of the year, we now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $625 million and $630 million. With that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. Our strong foundation of technology leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued success. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies reported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'm excited to announce that Edwards is planning to host an investor update at TCT on Saturday, September 17. This event will recap -- will include a recap of pivotal trial data, updates on our latest technologies, and views on longer-term market potential. We hope to see you there. But please note this meeting will be webcast for those who cannot attend in person. More information will be available in the coming weeks. With that, we're ready to take questions now. To allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, TAVR is such a necessary procedure for these patients. And it's sad to see it slow down like this, but it's understandable given how many steps are involved in the patient population involved. What's your sense of what the early funnel is like? How are , you know, how's the early funnel with patient visits to doctors, diagnosis? Where is really the bottleneck that you're seeing? And how do you expect the funnel to play out in third and fourth quarter, both U.S. and outside the U.S.?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, this -- what we're feeling right now is different than the early days of the pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic, yes, there was impact on hospital capacity, but you also had patients that were just concerned about coming into the system and they stayed away. We feel like patients are entering the system now and are queued up to go through and there's just a lack of capacity in hospitals, in some cases, to handle all the patients. And so that care is being postponed. You're right, given that this disease is so deadly, it is very concerning because we know these patients don't wait well and there are going to be some casualties. I don't know, Larry, do you have anything to add to that?\nLarry Wood: No, I think that's a good summary. When the pandemic first happened, hospitals, the beds were all filled up with COVID patients, and we don't see that today. Hospitals have beds, they have capacity. They just don't have staff. And I think some of what we're challenge with a little bit is as people test positive for COVID, they're not getting hospitalized, but they have to leave the workforce where they isolate. And I think that's exacerbating a little bit of staffing challenges. But you're right, the patients don't wait well. And we were already dealing with undertreatment of AS before the pandemic hit and certainly this hasn't made it better. But these patients deserve therapy, and we're hoping this returns back to more normal state soon.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on MTT, it's not surprising given the euro exposure to see the guidance moved down there on a dollar basis. But this is also a market that's recovering probably slower than we had thought at the December Analyst Day. So, maybe you could walk us through how much of it is PASCAL and your product set versus the competition? And how much is the market? And how we should think about cadence there in third and fourth quarter? It still requires a step-up to reach the midpoint of guidance. Thanks a lot.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So, yes, a couple of things. As we mentioned, because most of the PASCAL sales are in Europe, we do get affected by currency in a more dramatic way than we would otherwise. But the other issue is less of a competitive issue as we're really feeling like the market didn't grow. It really slowed down in TMTT. And Bernard, why don't you provide some color on that.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. Yes, exactly, Mike. So if you think about on a short-term basis, the TMTT procedures are more resource-intensive. They require general anesthesia, ICU stay for the patients. So therefore, they have been impacted more than any other procedure that we know here.\nMike Mussallem: Diego, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One for Larry, one for Bernard or whoever wants to jump in. Just on TAVR, just Larry, any color on trends in the U.S. TAVR market in Q2? How much do you think the contrast shortage impacted you? And I'd love to hear why you think the U.S. has been softer than Europe? And I have one follow-up for Bernard.\nLarry Wood: Yes. Contrast, I think, was more of an issue here, early in the quarter than late in the quarter. It seemed to get better as the quarter went on. But certainly, there was an impact. It probably impacted smaller hospitals more than the bigger systems that probably had more reserve. So that was that. In terms of trends, as much as we get frustrated by it, we did grow sequentially. So we did see an improvement in hospital staffing just not as much as we were anticipating. And we obviously have a tough comparison to a year ago when we grew almost 50%. So, that's just kind of where it is. We still anticipate it's going to get better over the course of the year. It's just been more slow than we would have hoped.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. And just to add on, Larry, your question about Europe versus the U.S., we did see staffing shortages in Europe but they were more isolated in nature. We saw them in particular countries or regions, whereas the U.S., it really felt more widespread, more broad. And so, it turned out to be more pronounced. We were able to more or less swamp those in Europe.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then Mike, for you or Bernard, for PASCAL and CLASP IID, I guess, should we -- I assume we should read into your expectations of PASCAL approval by year-end. You feel good about the trial meeting. Its endpoints. That's part A. And part B, there have been a lot of changes to both PASCAL and MitraClip since the trial started, PASCAL A's precision, MitraClip's gone from Gen 2 to Gen 4. How might that impact the results? And do you expect kind of a mix of different devices in the trial? Thanks for taking the question.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, thanks. You did perceive it correctly. We feel like we're on track for our year-end approval in PASCAL. We're going forward to that. As I'll remind you, that trial is designed as a non-inferiority trial. And so but that's what the target is. But you also brought up another interesting point. If you look at what's available for clinicians today, some of that data is kind of old, right? It's for patients that were treated maybe five years ago and sometimes even further back and there have been a lot of improvements in our system and competitors as well. And so what it will be also interesting about the data that we see is we'll see more or less a contemporary update of how edge-to-edge procedures are going, anything to add to that, Bernard?\nBernard Zovighian: No. You're right, Larry. We are -- what you are going to see is a number of analyses done with these pivotal studies. We have the original PASCAL and ACE, a number of mitral generation also. But as you can imagine, like in any pivotal randomized study, you have the first result will represent the data necessary to support approval and adoption. And what you can expect is additional presentation overtime with more analysis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks for taking my question. One on -- I guess, on the PASCAL side here, the -- given all of these revenues coming out of Europe, and Europe seems to be perhaps less impacted by labor shortages, did we just get the adoption curve wrong? Or maybe just talk about what changed in the revenue band for Europe for PASCAL?\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks for the question. So in Q2, we continue to grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. We continue to grow our presence, our teams, we open new sites both in Germany and outside of Germany. We feel good about our meaningful presence in Germany, even though there are more to do. Beyond Germany, there is still a lot to do. So the adoption is going at the pace we want in terms of site adoption and PASCAL adoption for sure, the market growth was less than anticipated in Q2. And we expect that to last and to improve gradually in the second part of the year.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. And I might just add, Vijay, that because our business is more concentrated in TMTT, in certain regions like, for example, there's more, business in Europe or in Germany, in particular, than other parts of Europe, some of those labor shortages and strikes in Germany probably had a little greater impact on this. So that combined with the point that Bernard made earlier that these procedures still require anesthesiologists and ICU space are probably why the market slowed. And you'd also argue in Europe, they're not fully convinced, right, because they have the mitral FR data that also is out there. And so it's another reason why we're kind of excited about bringing a new data set later on this year.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful perspective, Mike. And maybe one for Scott, on the EPS guidance, I think the implied fourth quarter EPS, depending on third quarter assumptions, it could either be flattish or down sequentially. Is that just a function of how the FX hedges roll off or anything else that's going on that drives the fourth quarter EPS?\nScott Ullem: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. We'll just -- maybe the way to answer it is to bridge the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.58 to guidance now, which is more like the bottom of that $2.50 to $2.65. And the moving pieces are probably first and foremost, just the sales change from the original guidance, partly driven by sales and just some of the headwinds that we've talked about, partly driven by FX and how that impacts sales and then flows down to EPS. You know, we're seeing a higher tax rate, as we talked about. We think now the tax rate is going to look something more like 15% of the top end of our original 11% to 15% range. That probably cost us about a nickel. And then we've seen some positives as well. We think we're going to get a couple of pennies from increased interest income as a result of what's happening in the investment market and $0.02 or so share count based upon all the repurchase activities that we've been doing so far. So we're not guiding to fourth quarter EPS down, but that gives you a sense of how the overall year looks compared to our prior guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon or evening. And thanks for taking the question. As we think about 2023, I appreciate the commentary on the FX hedges slipping and the impact to gross margins next year. Is there anything in particular that you would like to comment on? Because I think generally, people are starting to make sure the 2023 numbers are somewhat a ballpark based on what we currently know.\nScott Ullem: So do you want to talk about the 2023 gross profit numbers are in the ballpark based upon what you know?\nJoanne Wuensch: Well, I'm talking just any metric you can give us, and thank you for the gross margin commentary, but anything else you may be able to set us up with?\nScott Ullem: Yes, it's premature to start talking about the different line items of the P&L for 2023. Of course, we'll go through that in detail at the investor conference. But -- because gross margin has been so impacted by FX this year, we did want to give a little bit of a lens into what's going to happen as these hedges start rolling off in 2023. So based upon FX rates right now, we'll lose something like 250 basis points of the 350 basis point benefit we're seeing in 2022. Keep in mind, that's compared to 2021. So in other words, we still think we'll get something like a 100 basis point benefit from FX in 2023 because we've locked in some hedge gains during the first half of this year. All in, for modeling purposes, if you think about 77.5% or something like that, somewhere in that range, that's probably a good modeling assumption for now for next year.\nJoanne Wuensch: And then as a second question, assuming FDA approval by the end of this year for PASCAL, how do we think about launch, again, going into next year? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So maybe Bernard, you best to go through that, you can go through the particulars of how we plan to launch.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So first, let me say, we are pleased with our progress in Europe. So -- building the U.S. launch plan. Having in mind, what we did in Europe, obviously, our great success with TAVR in the U.S. You know, we are currently building the U.S. TMTT field team focusing on obviously high quality of training, making sure that we can execute on our high-touch model, the same way we are doing in Europe, having in mind excellent in the patient outcome. So obviously, we expect our U.S. launch with clinical evidence, which we didn't have when we launched in Europe, which is a big difference. At the same time, one of the other difference also is we are going to have only a DMR approval. So that's the way to think about the U.S. launch.\nMike Mussallem: And maybe just to add a little bit more, Joanne, this is going to be a step-wise launch. We're not going to try and serve all hospitals at once. We're going to -- we've really prioritized the group. That will be our first step, but we're trying to make sure that we have a well-trained team that assures great outcomes right from the beginning. So, it will be more of a ramp than a step function.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask just if you could provide some color on both the COVID, the staffing shortage impact on enrolling some of the trials in the U.S., both the CLASP studies, ALLIANCE. And then, if you have an outlook right now just around export timing, approval timing, above some color how you're thinking about that as well?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Cecilia. Maybe I start, and I'll let Larry and Bernard jump in to add some additional color about the trial. Just broadly, the fact that COVID has been persistent is a burden on hospital. In any way, you slice it, because what happens is even though we don't consider today's COVID so deadly. When someone tests positive, they're out. People they've had contact with are out and miss five days. So it really is disruptive to a team and that can help and have some impact. Having said that, overall, we feel pretty good about our clinical research. Larry, why don't you update us on the TAVR side and Bernard, you can talk about TMTT.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Well, we have three big trials. We have early TAVR, which is fully enrolled. And we have our PROGRESS trial, which is our trial where we're studying moderate aortic stenosis. And while we certainly see some impact, we've been actually pretty pleased with how that's going so far, and there's a lot of clinician interest. And then, we just started enrolling last month in our ALLIANCE trial, which is our X4 trial for our next-generation SAPIEN platform. And we've been pleased with the enthusiasm there. You always start the trial a little bit slow as you're getting sites up and you're getting them trained in a brand new valve platform. But overall, we've been pleased with the start.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. And for TMTT today, we completed enrollment. We have CLASP IIF, CLASP II TR. We have TRISCEND II for EVOQUE. So yes, Mike  procedures are more resource intensive and they require more staffing. But we have seen a little bit of an impact, but not so much. We are pleased with the kind of enrollment we are having across all of the TMTT trials.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Thank you. And if I could ask as well, just going back to your Analyst Day, you talked about your DTC TAVR initiative. Just would love some color in terms of and what you've seen out of that, where you are in that process at this point? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So thanks. I mean, I don't know, Larry, if you want to update that. We continue to be very focused on trying to make sure that we help patients come off the sideline just because it is such a big issue. It is going to be an important source of growth.\nLarry Wood: Yes. We continue on these efforts even though the hospitals are struggling a little bit to train the patients they have. It takes a while for these patients to move through from diagnosis, to screening and to treatment. And so, we just think it's important to keep raising awareness around aortic stenosis, because it remains woefully undertreated, only about 10% to 15% of patients with severe aortic stenosis actually get treated today. And again, we're running the trials to prove the point with early TAVR and with progress, but we know these patients don't wait well even though some people may think they wait better than they actually do. So we're committed to the evidence, and we're committed to making sure patients are aware and we continue to execute on those programs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTravis Steed: Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at Q3, you've said some of the Q2 staffing issues either the contract is more of a Q2 issue. But in Q3, there's usually some seasonality. So if you look at U.S. TAVR, I was curious if you think TAVR could be up sequentially at this time around or if it's probably down sequentially in Q3?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. I'll just start out by reminding you that across Edwards, business, it's very normal for us to have Q3 be seasonally down compared to all the other quarters of the year because our procedures are generally done in teams and people take their summer vacations, that's routinely going to be down. The other factors that are in there, they just add to that. So no, we probably expect Q3 to be lower than Q2 and then Q4 to rebound to a higher level yet, but that would be a more typical seasonality. I don't know, Larry do you have anything to add on U.S.?\nLarry Wood: Yes. I think that's right. I think people are still pent up. And if you try to get a hotel reservation or an airline reservation lately, I think people are certainly taking their vacations, right? But I think the good news is the contrast issue, I think, is largely behind us, maybe not 100%, but pretty close. We're not hearing near as much issue with that. So I think getting that behind us is helpful and -- but as Mike said, we typically do see some seasonality in Q3.\nTravis Steed: No, that's fair. Thank you. And OUS, it was down sequentially this quarter. I don't think there's anything else to call out that you haven't already called out, but love some more color there. And then, if you look at PASCAL and the benefits that you see there versus competitive device. I'm just curious if you look at how everything is designed, the product's design, if you think there's, a way you could potentially compete clinically with a competitive device or if there's other ways that you plan to compete there?\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Actually, so I'm not under the impression that we were down sequentially in Q2. Maybe that could be a byproduct of a foreign exchange and that may be what you're seeing. But on an underlying basis, actually, there was sequential growth. Bernard, do you want to jump on the second part of the question?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So on PASCAL, let me address two things. One is maybe the second half of the year and a little bit about PASCAL, the benefit of the device. So second half of the year, we are going to continue executing our strategy opening more sites in Germany, outside of Germany, driving the adoption of PASCAL with our high-touch model. And what we see, obviously, in Europe is that we have a differentiated device. We are very pleased with the kind of patient outcome we are having. But obviously, at TCT with the first of its kind CLASP II randomized study, this is going to inform us, inform the medical community about the difference between the two devices, Tier overall, so a lot of learning coming from the TCT presentation here.\nTravis Steed: Great. And I'll recheck my model on the Q2 thing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nSuraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike, Larry, in terms of low-risk symptomatic aortic stenosis, right, a number of patients are bicuspid. And I'm curious about the bicuspid registry in ALLIANCE, why so now? And also the 915 patient size, it's a single-arm study. So any additional color would be greatly appreciated.\nMike Mussallem: On clintrials.gov, I think the 900-plus number relates to the primary cohort along with the registry with the registries that we have. We try to study all, sort of, the adjacencies bicuspid. We try to study the valve and valve things, all the different ways in which our platform gets used because it's quite versatile. So we -- some of those registries lag a little bit starting the original cohort, but they usually come on and so I think that's what's reflected in the numbers there. Bicuspid patients require, sort of, a different level of screening anatomically. So we tend to run those in a separate registry so that we can report on them separately. But then we have the primary cohort for all the patients. But I believe this trial is pretty much in a near all-comer trial. I don't think we're limited to just low-risk patients. So it's going to be pretty much a real-world trial on how this technology performs.\nSuraj Kalia: Fair enough. And Larry, Mike again, last question, I'll hop back in queue. Maybe you all could give us some guidepost in Japan. Our understanding is TAVR is annualizing somewhere 25,000 to 30,000 cases across 250 or so sites. I'd love to get some perspective of where Edwards stacks up in Japan so that we can strip out that contribution? Thank you for taking my questions.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks for that. I don't know that I have the level of detail to be able to fully satisfy your question. Indeed, like most places around the world, we're very proud to be market leaders. But there's still a lot of work for us to do in Japan. They have an elderly population. And even though we've enjoyed some really nice growth over the last couple of years, we should be getting that kind of growth because there's that under treatment rate is significant. We've been buoyed over the past year or so by the addition of hospitals, which has been very helpful. It had been originally more restricted in Japan, and so that's grown, and that's been a contributor as well. Larry, do you have anything to add to that?\nLarry Wood: Yes. You know, Japan has been a little bit unique in terms of how the markets develop. In the other markets, we sort of went from this high risk to this intermediate risk to these low-risk approvals. And in Japan, we went directly from high risk and kind of almost inoperable immediately to low risk. So it's taking time for people to adjust to, sort of, that new normal because it's a much bigger step function. But Mike is absolutely right. In terms of the number of elderly patients there and the opportunity there, even though we've enjoyed pretty robust growth there, the opportunity there remains large.1\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Ridley with Redburn. Please state your question.\nEd Ridley: Good evening. Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-ups, please. First of all, on the contrast media shortage. Scott, thanks for your comments. Could you just quantify the impact in the quarter? That would be helpful. And it's obviously good to hear that it's pretty much behind you. Also, I had a question on capital investment from the hospitals. We heard differing comments from different management teams during this -- the last couple of weeks on whether or not there is pressure on CapEx spending, particularly in the U.S. And I was wondering if there had been any effects on Critical Care or whether you're seeing any signs of that? Thank you.\nScott Ullem: Okay. Well, thanks. On the contrast media, I don't know that I can specifically characterize the size. As Larry mentioned, we saw it more in smaller hospitals. We saw more early in the quarter anticipate. Do we think it had an impact on Q2, we do. But it was a smaller impact than overall hospital staffing. So you can almost think of it as an 80-20 thing, something like that. Contrast Media was relatively small by comparison. On the capital spending trends, our only lens that is the Critical Care business. So compared to some others in the medtech industry, they may have a better handle on this because they are more exclusively capital. We're in a very limited segment and it's hard for us to know whether it's the capital budget in hospitals, our own performance, we've had pretty significant demand and we've been able to meet that. And we continue to be pleased with the pipeline of orders that are ahead. So we feel pretty good about the really being capital spending. It's nothing like it was when it was constrained early on in the pandemic, we feel like hospitals are indeed spending, at least from our narrow perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please state your question.\nBill Plovanic: Good evening. My first question is, in terms of the U.S. TAVR and the number of centers I think on the fourth quarter call, you said you had about 850 centers. I was wondering where you ended at the end of June? And kind of how should we think about center growth going forward? And then my second question is just on your SG&A spend was pretty high. It's a big jump sequentially. And I guess is a lot of that kind of the prebuild or the build of the infrastructure for PASCAL? And thanks for taking my questions \nMike Mussallem: Sure. Maybe I'll start out here. In terms of U.S. TAVR centers, yes, the addition centers wasn't necessarily a big deal in terms of a growth driver. Larry, you might be able to characterize it more growth come from large centers or smaller centers this last quarter.\nLarry Wood: Well, it's sort of two things, right? So in terms of -- when we add new centers, all the cases they do are pretty much add to the growth. But the new centers that we had at this point in time to much smaller programs and they're a little slower than So they're not a huge part of our overall growth story. But one of the things that we do try to keep an eye on is what's happening in the larger programs versus the smaller programs. We have seen a little bit of a trend where when COVID cases start increasing and the variants come on, we tend to see a little bit more growth in the smaller programs. And I think that's staying closer to home. A lot of our big programs, maybe people will travel longer distances and they may be a little bit more reluctant to do so when COVID cases are up. So we've seen that dynamic as COVID has risen and fallen and I don't think this quarter was any different.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Larry. Scott, do you want to comment on the SG&A?\nScott Ullem: Sure. Bill, on SG&A, it was pretty close to what we expected, actually. Remember, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we ended up having pretty high SG&A relative to our plans. It ended up being lower as a result in the first quarter. So it might have looked like a bigger jump just artificially because of the timing and sequencing of Q4 to Q1. But year-over-year in the second quarter, SG&A grew high single digits, pretty close to what we expected. You're right that we are investing pretty aggressively for long-term positioning of TAVR and TMTT in particular, both outside of the U.S. and in the U.S. So we're feeling good about where we are just in terms of our overall SG&A load.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please state your question.\nAdam Maeder: Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions. I'll keep it to just one. Maybe just on a bulk tricuspid, would love to get some additional color there. It sounds like you're still hopeful that, that product could come to market in Europe by year-end 2022. Just what are the expectations in the marketplace? And then just more broadly, how do you think about the repair versus replacement debate in the tricuspid setting? Thanks so much.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks very much for that, Adam. Indeed, you did read correctly into our comments that we have introduced some uncertainty into whether we actually will get EVOQUE approved by the end of the year for CE Mark. Bernard, do you want to talk a little bit more about that?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, Mike. So as you know, there is a new process in Europe called MDR. And MDR, it is very -- it is probably more uncertain for very novel breakthrough technologies like EVOQUE. It is new, so they are looking at it. They might ask more clinical data, maybe even randomized data, who knows. So that's basically what we are facing right now. We are obviously partnering with our notified body to make sure they get the need to make an approval here. So now your second question is about repair versus replacement. We believe that we see value in both. I think Mike talked about what we presented at ECC and EuroPCR, where our PASCAL tricuspid CLASP study we are presented. It is a single arm study, and it shows some benefit for patients. And also, we are very excited about the kind of outcome we are having with EVOQUE. So we believe that we have value for both, and it will depend on the patient, patient anatomy, how sick they are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please state your question.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good evening. Thanks gentlemen. And I wanted to just ask two kind of market size questions. First, just on the U.S. degenerative mitigation opportunity. I think Abbott's cited about 70,000 patients per year number, and then building a TAM from there. This is specifically for degenerative MR. I mean some of our consultants have cited some bigger numbers, but I don't want to front run your investor event at TCT later in the year. But any initial thoughts before getting into the U.S. market just on the size of the generative MR opportunity? And a similar question for tricuspid, just a little more maybe globally, similar line of inquiry just consultants sharing that tricuspid case volumes could be very strong and ultimate patient opportunity large and tricuspid could be $1 billion-plus global opportunity, but I wanted to get your thoughts on both of those two procedures. Thanks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you. So let me start by saying that we believe that there are many patients in it, many mitral patients, many tricuspid patients in need and that mitral is probably a little larger than tricuspid from an opportunity standpoint, at least at this point. Having said that, to comment on the U.S. DMR opportunity, we are not yet in the U.S. So Abbott is probably the best positioned to talk about how big is the market, the number of cases because we are not yet in this market.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, I will now hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "No, I think that's a good summary. When the pandemic first happened, hospitals, the beds were all filled up with COVID patients, and we don't see that today. Hospitals have beds, they have capacity. They just don't have staff. And I think some of what we're challenge with a little bit is as people test positive for COVID, they're not getting hospitalized, but they have to leave the workforce where they isolate. And I think that's exacerbating a little bit of staffing challenges. But you're right, the patients don't wait well. And we were already dealing with undertreatment of AS before the pandemic hit and certainly this hasn't made it better. But these patients deserve therapy, and we're hoping this returns back to more normal state soon. Yes. Contrast, I think, was more of an issue here, early in the quarter than late in the quarter. It seemed to get better as the quarter went on. But certainly, there was an impact. It probably impacted smaller hospitals more than the bigger systems that probably had more reserve. So that was that. In terms of trends, as much as we get frustrated by it, we did grow sequentially. So we did see an improvement in hospital staffing just not as much as we were anticipating. And we obviously have a tough comparison to a year ago when we grew almost 50%. So, that's just kind of where it is. We still anticipate it's going to get better over the course of the year. It's just been more slow than we would have hoped. Sure. Well, we have three big trials. We have early TAVR, which is fully enrolled.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks Mike. Despite several challenging factors, best hospital staffing and foreign exchange headwinds, our business fundamentals remain strong. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.37 billion with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan. We expected our underlying growth in the second quarter would be our lowest of the year, given our strong prior year sales performance. Our higher than expected gross profit margin lifted by the positive impact from our foreign exchange program, contributed to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. We are adjusting our guidance to more accurately reflect the continuation of the more pronounced FX headwinds and slower than expected improvement in COVID-related hospital staffing. We expect total company underlying sales growth of approximately 10% in the second half of this year. For full year 2022, we now expect total Edwards sales of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We expect TAVR sales of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion; for TMTT, $110 million to $140 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care, $8 20 million to $900 million. Now expect full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the bottom end of our original guidance range of $2.50 to $2.65. For the third quarter, we're projecting sales to be between $1.30 billion and $1.37 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.66. I'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the second quarter was 80.5% compared to 75.9% in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by the higher than expected positive impact from our FX program, which includes natural hedges and hedge contract gains that offset the sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen versus the dollar. At current foreign exchange rates, we now expect our full year and second half 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to increase to approximately 80%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from FX hedge gains and an improved product mix partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures. This year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange versus 2021. At current FX rates, in 2023, we expect an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $409 million or 29.8% of sales, primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30%, as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 11% compared to the same period last year to $251 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including eight currently enrolling pivotal clinical trials. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. During the second quarter, we recorded a $21 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. This reflects an accounting adjustment from assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for previous acquisition. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.5% or 12.9%, excluding the impact of special items. Due to last quarter's new regulations that potentially limit the amount of our foreign tax credits, combined with an estimated reduced tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting. We now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our previous 11% to 15% range. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 4.6 percentage points or $60 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $250 million negative impact or 4.5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, of which approximately $170 million impacts the second half of the year. FX rates positively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. We mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit resulting in a minimal impact to the bottom-line in the calendar year. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $289 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $332 million less capital spending of $43 million. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30th, 2022. Average shares outstanding during the quarter were $627 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 3.7 million shares during the second quarter for $355 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 7.3 million shares. In July, we obtained Board approval to increase the authorization under our share repurchase program consistent with our long-time practice of seeking new authorization when the prior authorization has been diminished. We now have $1.9 billion remaining under the program. Given our repurchase activity in the first half of the year, we now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $625 million and $630 million. With that, I'll pass it back over to Mike. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. We'll just -- maybe the way to answer it is to bridge the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.58 to guidance now, which is more like the bottom of that $2.50 to $2.65. And the moving pieces are probably first and foremost, just the sales change from the original guidance, partly driven by sales and just some of the headwinds that we've talked about, partly driven by FX and how that impacts sales and then flows down to EPS. You know, we're seeing a higher tax rate, as we talked about. We think now the tax rate is going to look something more like 15% of the top end of our original 11% to 15% range. That probably cost us about a nickel. And then we've seen some positives as well. We think we're going to get a couple of pennies from increased interest income as a result of what's happening in the investment market and $0.02 or so share count based upon all the repurchase activities that we've been doing so far. So we're not guiding to fourth quarter EPS down, but that gives you a sense of how the overall year looks compared to our prior guidance. So do you want to talk about the 2023 gross profit numbers are in the ballpark based upon what you know? Yes, it's premature to start talking about the different line items of the P&L for 2023. Of course, we'll go through that in detail at the investor conference. But -- because gross margin has been so impacted by FX this year, we did want to give a little bit of a lens into what's going to happen as these hedges start rolling off in 2023. So based upon FX rates right now, we'll lose something like 250 basis points of the 350 basis point benefit we're seeing in 2022. Keep in mind, that's compared to 2021. So in other words, we still think we'll get something like a 100 basis point benefit from FX in 2023 because we've locked in some hedge gains during the first half of this year. All in, for modeling purposes, if you think about 77.5% or something like that, somewhere in that range, that's probably a good modeling assumption for now for next year. Okay. Well, thanks. On the contrast media, I don't know that I can specifically characterize the size. As Larry mentioned, we saw it more in smaller hospitals. We saw more early in the quarter anticipate. Do we think it had an impact on Q2, we do. But it was a smaller impact than overall hospital staffing. So you can almost think of it as an 80-20 thing, something like that. Contrast Media was relatively small by comparison. On the capital spending trends, our only lens that is the Critical Care business. So compared to some others in the medtech industry, they may have a better handle on this because they are more exclusively capital. We're in a very limited segment and it's hard for us to know whether it's the capital budget in hospitals, our own performance, we've had pretty significant demand and we've been able to meet that. And we continue to be pleased with the pipeline of orders that are ahead. So we feel pretty good about the really being capital spending. It's nothing like it was when it was constrained early on in the pandemic, we feel like hospitals are indeed spending, at least from our narrow perspective. Sure. Bill, on SG&A, it was pretty close to what we expected, actually. Remember, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we ended up having pretty high SG&A relative to our plans. It ended up being lower as a result in the first quarter. So it might have looked like a bigger jump just artificially because of the timing and sequencing of Q4 to Q1. But year-over-year in the second quarter, SG&A grew high single digits, pretty close to what we expected. You're right that we are investing pretty aggressively for long-term positioning of TAVR and TMTT in particular, both outside of the U.S. and in the U.S. So we're feeling good about where we are just in terms of our overall SG&A load."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. In the second quarter, total company sales reflected year-over-year and sequential growth across all four of our product groups on a constant currency basis, despite several challenging factors. Sales were lifted by strong performance outside the U.S. with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan. On a constant currency basis, total company sales grew 5% compared to the extraordinary second quarter of 2021 when sales increased 44% lifted by the treatment of patients who had postponed their care. Nevertheless, second quarter sales and EPS were at the lower end of our expectations as a result of U.S. hospitals struggling with staffing shortages as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. We now anticipate that these challenges are likely to persist throughout 2022. And as a result, we are lowering our second half outlook to more realistically reflect the current operating environment. Although, the near-term environment remains uncertain, we are unwavering in our long-term pursuit of groundbreaking innovations. We're investing to achieve breakthrough therapies that create significant value for patients in the healthcare systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. We continue to make meaningful progress on our pipeline and expect to achieve important milestones by year-end. As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we continue to believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028. Now, turning to the quarterly results by product group, in TAVR, second quarter global sales of $907 million increased 5% on an underlying basis, despite approximately 50% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our expectations due to the ongoing U.S. hospital staffing constraints and foreign exchange headwinds, but still represented our highest quarter of TAVR sales. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards, growth in the second quarter. In general, local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined slightly due to the weakening euro and yen. In Q2, we continued to advance two pivotal trials aiming to expand indications. First, our EARLY TAVR trial is studying the large group of patients with severe aortic stenosis and no diagnosed symptoms. Second, our PROGRESS trial is evaluating patients with moderate AS, which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. And last month, we also began treating patients in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next-generation SAPIEN X4. In the U.S. our TAVR sales were approximately flat with the elevated prior year but increased in the high single-digit range sequentially. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, our second quarter U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by slower-than-expected improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages. Also recall in Q2 of last year, our U.S. TAVR sales increased over 50% on a year-over-year basis, as COVID vaccines became more widely available and patients who had waited were treated. On a three-year compounded annual basis, our U.S. TAVR sales increased 10% compared to the strong second quarter in 2019. Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedural growth was comparable. This strong growth outside the U.S. was consistent with our underlying three-year compounded annual growth rate also in the mid-teens. Long term, we see excellent opportunities, for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. In Europe, Edwards, sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We estimate that our competitive position was stable. Localized hospital staffing disruptions impacted second quarter results, although this headwind was less pronounced than in the U.S. 15 years after commercialization, it's encouraging to see the resilience of the TAVR programs in Europe, despite the challenging backdrop of today's environment. In Japan, we experienced continued strong TAVR adoption as we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Similar to last quarter, the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement following approval last year for patients at low surgical risk. In summary, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. Recall that we had previously assumed an improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing shortages throughout the year. We're now anticipating a slower improvement. And as a result, we are adjusting our full year outlook. We expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 10% in full year 2022 versus the previous expectation for 12% to 15%. Longer term, we remain confident in this large global opportunity and that it will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Now, turning to TMTT. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity for mitral and tricuspid patients, we remain focused on three key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies; positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. At the TCT conference in September, we expect the first results of the Class IID pivotal trial evaluating patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation. This is -- this first of its kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial, powered for non-inferiority, will be the first of several key pivotal trials evaluating the PASCAL technology. Additionally, at TCT, we expect three-year data from the earlier class study. This growing contemporary body of clinical evidence will be important for the physician community considering transcatheter edge-to-edge repair treatments for mitral patients. We remain on track for U.S. FDA approval and CE Mark approval of PASCAL precision by year end. This next-generation system is designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience, extending our differentiated platform. This will allow us to expand PASCAL adoption in Europe, and we're pleased that we'll be launching the newest generation of PASCAL in the U.S. In mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the in-circle pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE EOS. Growing evidence with these Sub 30-French transfemoral therapies furthers our confidence in both platforms. Turning to tricuspid. We also continue to make progress on enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE replacement system and the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. While we remain hopeful for year-end approval in Europe, uncertainties exist regarding the new MDR approval process for novel technologies seeking a CE Mark. We remain committed to bringing the EVOQUE therapy to these tricuspid patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. As we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we're pleased with the recent data from several late-breaking presentations. One year results from our CLASS TR study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference demonstrated significantly reduced TR, improved quality of life and maintain TR reduction. Also at the EuroPCR meeting, 30-day post-market data from our tri-class study was presented with 90% of the patients showing improvements in their quality of life. At upcoming medical conferences this year, we plan for contemporary evidence to be presented on both our PASCAL and EVOQUE platforms. Turning to results. Second quarter global sales were $28 million, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform and activation of more centers across Europe. Our Q2 commercial performance was tempered by lower-than-expected market growth related primarily to COVID headwinds We are now updating our full year guidance to $110 to $140 million, which represents approximately 60% underlying growth over the prior year and reflects a stronger-than-anticipated impact from foreign exchange as the vast majority of TMTT's business is in Europe.  Bigger picture, we continue to be pleased with our progress forward on three key value drivers. We're advancing our comprehensive portfolio of differentiated therapies combined with contemporary clinical evidence and favorable real-world patient outcomes. Together, this demonstrates the promise of these therapies for this significant unmet patient need and will help unlock this large market potential. In Surgical Structural Heart, second quarter 2022 global sales of $229 million increased 2% on an underlying basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see global growth despite sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products as well as the COVID shutdown in China, which combined growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our growth continues to be driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products. We've seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. since its initial launch in April. Building on the commercial success of INSPIRIS, we believe hospitals value the intuitive product features as well as the benefits of this innovative RESILIA tissue technology. Physician feedback in regions where MITRIS has been launched has been positive and initial clinical outcomes have been favorable. In the second quarter, we continued to bolster the overall body of RESILIA evidence. This includes a commenced trial sub-analysis, which demonstrated the excellent performance of this tissue technology when treating bicuspid aortic valve disease, which was presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons in May. In a cohort of more than 200 patients averaging a relatively young 60 years of age, structural valve deterioration was zero at five years. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and global surgical market growth. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $211 million increased 3% on an underlying basis. As expected, growth was moderated by strong prior year comparisons. Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of our hypotension prediction index algorithm and our broad portfolio of sensors. Additionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI Smart BP trial focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support further adoption. Demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth in 2022. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions for their patients. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. Our strong foundation of technology leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued success. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies reported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, this -- what we're feeling right now is different than the early days of the pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic, yes, there was impact on hospital capacity, but you also had patients that were just concerned about coming into the system and they stayed away. We feel like patients are entering the system now and are queued up to go through and there's just a lack of capacity in hospitals, in some cases, to handle all the patients. And so that care is being postponed. You're right, given that this disease is so deadly, it is very concerning because we know these patients don't wait well and there are going to be some casualties. I don't know, Larry, do you have anything to add to that? Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So, yes, a couple of things. As we mentioned, because most of the PASCAL sales are in Europe, we do get affected by currency in a more dramatic way than we would otherwise. But the other issue is less of a competitive issue as we're really feeling like the market didn't grow. It really slowed down in TMTT. And Bernard, why don't you provide some color on that. Diego, next question please. Yes. And just to add on, Larry, your question about Europe versus the U.S., we did see staffing shortages in Europe but they were more isolated in nature. We saw them in particular countries or regions, whereas the U.S., it really felt more widespread, more broad. And so, it turned out to be more pronounced. We were able to more or less swamp those in Europe. Yes, thanks. You did perceive it correctly. We feel like we're on track for our year-end approval in PASCAL. We're going forward to that. As I'll remind you, that trial is designed as a non-inferiority trial. And so but that's what the target is. But you also brought up another interesting point. If you look at what's available for clinicians today, some of that data is kind of old, right? It's for patients that were treated maybe five years ago and sometimes even further back and there have been a lot of improvements in our system and competitors as well. And so what it will be also interesting about the data that we see is we'll see more or less a contemporary update of how edge-to-edge procedures are going, anything to add to that, Bernard? Yes. And I might just add, Vijay, that because our business is more concentrated in TMTT, in certain regions like, for example, there's more, business in Europe or in Germany, in particular, than other parts of Europe, some of those labor shortages and strikes in Germany probably had a little greater impact on this. So that combined with the point that Bernard made earlier that these procedures still require anesthesiologists and ICU space are probably why the market slowed. And you'd also argue in Europe, they're not fully convinced, right, because they have the mitral FR data that also is out there. And so it's another reason why we're kind of excited about bringing a new data set later on this year. Yes. So maybe Bernard, you best to go through that, you can go through the particulars of how we plan to launch. And maybe just to add a little bit more, Joanne, this is going to be a step-wise launch. We're not going to try and serve all hospitals at once. We're going to -- we've really prioritized the group. That will be our first step, but we're trying to make sure that we have a well-trained team that assures great outcomes right from the beginning. So, it will be more of a ramp than a step function. Yes. Thanks, Cecilia. Maybe I start, and I'll let Larry and Bernard jump in to add some additional color about the trial. Just broadly, the fact that COVID has been persistent is a burden on hospital. In any way, you slice it, because what happens is even though we don't consider today's COVID so deadly. When someone tests positive, they're out. People they've had contact with are out and miss five days. So it really is disruptive to a team and that can help and have some impact. Having said that, overall, we feel pretty good about our clinical research. Larry, why don't you update us on the TAVR side and Bernard, you can talk about TMTT. Yes. So thanks. I mean, I don't know, Larry, if you want to update that. We continue to be very focused on trying to make sure that we help patients come off the sideline just because it is such a big issue. It is going to be an important source of growth. Yes. I'll just start out by reminding you that across Edwards, business, it's very normal for us to have Q3 be seasonally down compared to all the other quarters of the year because our procedures are generally done in teams and people take their summer vacations, that's routinely going to be down. The other factors that are in there, they just add to that. So no, we probably expect Q3 to be lower than Q2 and then Q4 to rebound to a higher level yet, but that would be a more typical seasonality. I don't know, Larry do you have anything to add on U.S.? Okay. Actually, so I'm not under the impression that we were down sequentially in Q2. Maybe that could be a byproduct of a foreign exchange and that may be what you're seeing. But on an underlying basis, actually, there was sequential growth. Bernard, do you want to jump on the second part of the question? On clintrials.gov, I think the 900-plus number relates to the primary cohort along with the registry with the registries that we have. We try to study all, sort of, the adjacencies bicuspid. We try to study the valve and valve things, all the different ways in which our platform gets used because it's quite versatile. So we -- some of those registries lag a little bit starting the original cohort, but they usually come on and so I think that's what's reflected in the numbers there. Bicuspid patients require, sort of, a different level of screening anatomically. So we tend to run those in a separate registry so that we can report on them separately. But then we have the primary cohort for all the patients. But I believe this trial is pretty much in a near all-comer trial. I don't think we're limited to just low-risk patients. So it's going to be pretty much a real-world trial on how this technology performs. Thanks for that. I don't know that I have the level of detail to be able to fully satisfy your question. Indeed, like most places around the world, we're very proud to be market leaders. But there's still a lot of work for us to do in Japan. They have an elderly population. And even though we've enjoyed some really nice growth over the last couple of years, we should be getting that kind of growth because there's that under treatment rate is significant. We've been buoyed over the past year or so by the addition of hospitals, which has been very helpful. It had been originally more restricted in Japan, and so that's grown, and that's been a contributor as well. Larry, do you have anything to add to that? Sure. Maybe I'll start out here. In terms of U.S. TAVR centers, yes, the addition centers wasn't necessarily a big deal in terms of a growth driver. Larry, you might be able to characterize it more growth come from large centers or smaller centers this last quarter. Thanks, Larry. Scott, do you want to comment on the SG&A? Yes. Thanks very much for that, Adam. Indeed, you did read correctly into our comments that we have introduced some uncertainty into whether we actually will get EVOQUE approved by the end of the year for CE Mark. Bernard, do you want to talk a little bit more about that? Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Yes. Yes, exactly, Mike. So if you think about on a short-term basis, the TMTT procedures are more resource-intensive. They require general anesthesia, ICU stay for the patients. So therefore, they have been impacted more than any other procedure that we know here. No. You're right, Larry. We are -- what you are going to see is a number of analyses done with these pivotal studies. We have the original PASCAL and ACE, a number of mitral generation also. But as you can imagine, like in any pivotal randomized study, you have the first result will represent the data necessary to support approval and adoption. And what you can expect is additional presentation overtime with more analysis. Thanks for the question. So in Q2, we continue to grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. We continue to grow our presence, our teams, we open new sites both in Germany and outside of Germany. We feel good about our meaningful presence in Germany, even though there are more to do. Beyond Germany, there is still a lot to do. So the adoption is going at the pace we want in terms of site adoption and PASCAL adoption for sure, the market growth was less than anticipated in Q2. And we expect that to last and to improve gradually in the second part of the year. Yes. So first, let me say, we are pleased with our progress in Europe. So -- building the U.S. launch plan. Having in mind, what we did in Europe, obviously, our great success with TAVR in the U.S. You know, we are currently building the U.S. TMTT field team focusing on obviously high quality of training, making sure that we can execute on our high-touch model, the same way we are doing in Europe, having in mind excellent in the patient outcome. So obviously, we expect our U.S. launch with clinical evidence, which we didn't have when we launched in Europe, which is a big difference. At the same time, one of the other difference also is we are going to have only a DMR approval. So that's the way to think about the U.S. launch. Yes. And for TMTT today, we completed enrollment. We have CLASP IIF, CLASP II TR. We have TRISCEND II for EVOQUE. So yes, Mike  procedures are more resource intensive and they require more staffing. But we have seen a little bit of an impact, but not so much. We are pleased with the kind of enrollment we are having across all of the TMTT trials. Yes. So on PASCAL, let me address two things. One is maybe the second half of the year and a little bit about PASCAL, the benefit of the device. So second half of the year, we are going to continue executing our strategy opening more sites in Germany, outside of Germany, driving the adoption of PASCAL with our high-touch model. And what we see, obviously, in Europe is that we have a differentiated device. We are very pleased with the kind of patient outcome we are having. But obviously, at TCT with the first of its kind CLASP II randomized study, this is going to inform us, inform the medical community about the difference between the two devices, Tier overall, so a lot of learning coming from the TCT presentation here. Yes, Mike. So as you know, there is a new process in Europe called MDR. And MDR, it is very -- it is probably more uncertain for very novel breakthrough technologies like EVOQUE. It is new, so they are looking at it. They might ask more clinical data, maybe even randomized data, who knows. So that's basically what we are facing right now. We are obviously partnering with our notified body to make sure they get the need to make an approval here. So now your second question is about repair versus replacement. We believe that we see value in both. I think Mike talked about what we presented at ECC and EuroPCR, where our PASCAL tricuspid CLASP study we are presented. It is a single arm study, and it shows some benefit for patients. And also, we are very excited about the kind of outcome we are having with EVOQUE. So we believe that we have value for both, and it will depend on the patient, patient anatomy, how sick they are. Thank you. So let me start by saying that we believe that there are many patients in it, many mitral patients, many tricuspid patients in need and that mitral is probably a little larger than tricuspid from an opportunity standpoint, at least at this point. Having said that, to comment on the U.S. DMR opportunity, we are not yet in the U.S. So Abbott is probably the best positioned to talk about how big is the market, the number of cases because we are not yet in this market."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks, Diego, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2022 financial results.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities; regulatory approvals; clinical trials; litigation; reimbursement; competitive matters; and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMike Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I remain very proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient focused strategy. Throughout the first quarter, our supply chain delivered, and our field team continued to support the skilled clinicians and patients who count on Edwards. We continue to believe that 2022 will be an important year for Edwards Lifesciences as we expect low double-digit sales growth and meaningful progress on our pursuit of significant opportunities to improve patient care. Looking beyond 2022, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. Our patient focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world, and our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. As we're hopeful, the worst of the pandemic is behind us, we're constantly reminded of the importance of our work as we pursue solutions for cardiovascular disease, which continues to be the number one killer in the U.S and the world well ahead of cancer and other deadly conditions. Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Sales of $1.3 billion, increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Despite the impact that Omicron had on hospital capacity, resources and procedure volumes in January, especially in the U.S., Q1 global sales were moderately better than our expectations. Sales were lifted by performance outside the U.S where we experienced a less pronounced impact from the pandemic. Underlying sales growth was double-digit across all regions and benefited from improving trends as we progress through the first quarter. In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $881 million, an increase of 14% on an underlying basis with continued strong growth outside the U.S. We estimate that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our own growth, and average selling prices were stable globally. In the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew approximately 10% versus the prior year, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. TAVR adoption was broad based across hospitals, and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance. Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. We continue to see excellent opportunities for OUS growth, as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low. In Europe, Edward sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based across all countries. Our treatment rates recovered nicely throughout the quarter, although they differ by country, reflecting variable COVID impacts. We estimate that our competitive position was stable. In Japan, we also experienced strong TAVR adoption and the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement. Following reimbursement approval last year for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. And broadly across the globe, we continue to see encouraging TAVR adoption in many underpenetrated countries. In addition to geographic expansion, we remain focused on helping more patients gain access to TAVR therapy. In Q1, we continue to advance two pivotal trials aimed at expanding indication. First, our early TAVR trial for the large group of patients with severe AS and no diagnosed symptoms. And second, our PROGRESS trial that is evaluating patients with moderate AS, which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. We also remain on track to begin treating patients this quarter in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next generation TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. In summary, assuming no new COVID headwinds and a gradual improvement in U.S hospital staffing shortages throughout the year, we continue to plan for underlying TAVR sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 15%. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Now turning to TMTT. To transform patient care and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we continue to make steady progress on three key value drivers, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real world clinical outcomes. We are pleased with our high procedural success rates, and we continued our strong momentum with more patients than ever treated with our TMTT technologies this quarter. In mitral repair, we continue to achieve excellent clinical outcomes with PASCAL as we expand commercially and treat more patients in Europe. We remain on track for U.S approval of PASCAL Precision for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation late this year, supported by our Class IID pivotal trial. We continue to advance the enrollment of CLASP IIF pivotal study for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. And later this year, we expect European approval of our new PASCAL Precision system, which is engineered for enhanced navigation and an intuitive user experience extending our differentiated platform. In mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement technologies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study EVOQUE Eos. This early experience with these sub 30 French transfemoral therapies gives us confidence that these platforms have the potential to transform treatment for the many patients in need. Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies. As we continue to build a body of clinical evidence for PASCAL in the tricuspid position, we're pleased with the recently presented late breaking data at the ACC meeting last month. We are encouraged by the sustained significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation and improvements in quality-of-life measures experienced by patients and look forward to bringing additional clinical evidence through our Class IITR pivotal trial which is currently enrolling. In addition, we continue to make progress in enrolling our TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE system. We expect a late 2022 approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe, and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. Turning to our results, first quarter global TMTT sales were $27 million driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe. Although there was an impact from COVID early in the quarter, we exited march with positive momentum. As we expand in Europe, physicians continue to achieve high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes. Assuming a diminishing COVID-related impact, we are planning a gradual ramp in Q2 and a significant acceleration in the second half of the year to reach our 2022 sales guidance of $140 million to $170 million. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, the first quarter 2022 global sales of $221 million increased 6% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start to the year associated with COVID, we were encouraged by the steady improvement across most regions over the course of the quarter driven by increased penetration of premium technologies and procedure growth. Although hospital staffing shortages remain a concern, we believe that lifesaving surgical therapies continued to be prioritized. At the end of March, we announced the U.S FDA approval and commercial launch of our e MITRIS RESILIA valve, which adds to the portfolio of durable RESILIA tissue products with a valve designed for the heart's mitral position. Built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions. Today, nearly 60% of the world's surgical mitral valves are mechanical. RESILIA tissue should allow patients to thrive without the quality-of-life compromises that may come from having a mechanical valve. Initial feedback from U.S surgeons has been very positive. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for a surgical structural heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies. In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $212 million increased 11% on an underlying basis, driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Demand for our state-of-the-art hemisphere monitoring platform remains strong and lifted our sales. Our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors and our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices supported the increased number of patients in the ICU in the first quarter. Additionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI SMART-BP trial focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support the adoption of our Hypotension Predictive Index software. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, which are moderated by the strong prior year comparisons over the remainder of the year. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care Innovations as we continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks, Mike. We are encouraged by our start to the year. Despite the impact from Omicron early in the quarter, all product groups performed well and sales were balanced across all regions. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.341 billion, which represents 12.7% year-over-year underlying growth. This strong sales performance fell through to our operating income, and we achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Assuming no new COVID headwinds, and a gradual improvement in U.S hospital staffing shortages, we're projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion, which represents sequential organic growth from the first quarter partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter to be our lowest of the year, given our strong prior year sales performance. We were also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.69. Although we haven't fully overcome the January Omicron impact, we are maintaining all of our previous full year sales guidance ranges for 2022, despite more pronounced foreign exchange headwinds and COVID-related hospital staffing challenges in the U.S. As a reminder, for total Edwards, we expect sales of $5.5 billion to $6 billion; for TAVR $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion; for TMTT $140 million to $170 million; for Surgical Structural Heart $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care $820 million to $900 million. We're also maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.50 to $2.65, representing mid-teens growth over 2021. And now I will cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.8% compared to 76.0% in the same period last year. As we expected, this improvement was driven by the positive impact from foreign exchange, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the yen. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from foreign exchange hedged gains and improved product mix and partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $370 million or 27.6% of sales, reflecting field-based personnel-related costs and commercial activities in support of our growth. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percentage of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high touch model for TAVR, and ongoing build out of the TMTT commercial team. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $229 million, or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in are transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14.4%, excluding the impact of special items. This is slightly higher than the midpoint of our full year guidance range, because it included the unplanned impact of U.S tax regulations published in Q1. These regulations potentially limit the amount of foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S income taxes. We continue to expect our full year tax rate excluding special items to be 11% to 15%, including an estimated benefit of three percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates decreased our first quarter reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points, or $27 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $170 million negative impact, or about 3% to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021 versus our previous expectation of a $100 million negative impact. We forecast this additional $70 million negative impact to sales will occur over the remainder of the year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 240 basis points compared to the prior year. Although this benefits our operating margin rate relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share. As we mentioned at the Investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted, but as a result of financial and natural hedges margin rates benefit resulting in little impacts to the bottom line. At current rates, our operating margin in 2022 is benefiting by approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $221 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $294 million, less capital spending of $73 million. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow will be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. This includes approximately $200 million of accelerated tax payments due to a change in the tax treatment of research and development expenses. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 3 million to 629 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between 630 million to 635 million. And with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Thanks, Scott. So we're confident in our long-term outlook for strong sales growth and our teams remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership coupled with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue significant opportunities to improve patients' lives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Mike. With that we're ready to take questions. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on a nice start to the year. Just two for me. One, just on the progress to the recovery, and one on the guidance. I'll ask them both up front. So, for Mike, just a little more color on the recovery and what you're seeing in March and April, in the different geographies, particularly in your TAVR business. And Scott, regarding the guidance, should we still -- should we be thinking about the midpoint of the revenue range or a little bit lower because of the currency -- incremental currency impact? And regarding Q2, Scott, I heard your comment, it looks like about 6% underlying growth, assuming an FX headwind of about 4%. But it's only up about 4% sequentially, which seems conservative based on the historical quarter-over-quarter trends, and the Omicron impact you talked about in January. So just help us understand how you're thinking about the year and Q2? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Larry. So let me start out with the progress of the recovery. It's a little different, obviously, when you go around the globe. And I think the recovery that I'll talk about first is the U.S recovery, and I think that probably has the biggest impact on Edwards results and why it would be meaningful. Big picture, we're not sure that U.S hospitals have really fully recovered from COVID. There's still a bit of a hangover of protocols. And, more importantly, we -- this issue that relates to the significant labor crunch and churn in the workforce is meaningful. Those workforce shortages are real. They're having an effect on staffing and their costs and they're just in the front of mind of a lot of the health care industry. And some of this is churn, and some of this is just openings that are yet to be filled. Now in our conversation with hospital executives, systems are aggressively working to address these challenges and they expect the dynamic to improve, but we're anticipating gradual improvement in our forecasts. And I'd say overall, Edwards procedure growth, we've fared pretty well on a relative basis. We're mindful that these systems have been extraordinarily challenged, but we're still able to grow pretty handily in this tough environment.\nScott Ullem: Larry, on your second question regarding guidance, we always guide people to the middle of a range just for modeling purposes. So, at 13.60, or $1.360 billion to $1.440 billion, the midpoint of that is $1.4 billion. So that's a good modeling assumption. Your math is right, which is year-over-year underlying growth for Q2 with that range is in the range of about 5.5%. And yes, it's 4.4% of these exchange rates sequentially from Q1. So sequentially up from Q1. And really for the full year, it doesn't change our underlying growth rate and our guidance of low double digits. And so, while FX is impacting our dollar guidance ranges, it hasn't had a big impact to our underlying growth expectations.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Hey, thanks a lot. I'll add my congratulations on a nice start to the year as well. Maybe a follow-up on Larry's question. I was hoping to get a better sense of where some of the bottlenecks are in the patient recovery here. In some of let's call it the easier to schedule and diagnose procedures, we're seeing a little faster recovery or maybe a little more positive commentary. So, maybe walk us through where you're seeing the biggest bottlenecks here. And I imagine it's not a patient demand issue, it's probably more a logistics issue. So, I think that'd be helpful just to hear from you. Thanks.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Yes, thanks, Robbie. We don't have perfect visibility into the patient funnel. It's just kind of limited and we get a lot of our data from conversations with health care providers and our own frontline clinical specialists that really helped give us some perspective. And certainly, we believe that there's a small COVID-related backlog at this point, but we think that that's relatively small by compare, because I think the positive experience the clinical outcomes that people are having, but this is a story yet to be told. And so, we're going to have to live this one.\nRobbie Marcus: That's it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. So maybe just one if I could on TAVR centers, where you stand now. I know, we're sort of getting to maybe capacity of potential centers in the U.S. So, where you're at now and what the pace of new centers looked like, and then I just have one follow-up.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Yes, we think at this point, we're starting to approach about 850 centers in the U.S. And at this point, it's possible for there to be additional centers added, we still have some centers that approach us, but we think are going to be relatively few at this point. And we also think that they're going to probably tend to be smaller centers, and probably not have a dramatic impact on the overall numbers. But hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're at and what we're projecting.\nMatt Miksic: Sure. Yes, no, that's super helpful. And then on sort of just the TAVR capacity, I know you've labor intensive model, you've been expanding, obviously in investing, maybe, or Mike or Scott, if you could talk about what the pace of capacity build out looks like, compared to last year, maybe what it looks like this year going forward?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, it's easy to get lost in the pandemic, because we've had so many ups and downs. Maybe what I'll do is just remind you of what the company has been able to do over this period since 2019. And if you look at -- whether you're looking at the first quarter or full year 2022, we're looking at a 10% growth rate compounded annual growth rate. So, 10% each year from 2019 to now -- so 3 years, which gives you a sense that even with all of the constraints and incredible distractions and all the pressures that have been on systems, there's been a pretty continuous lifting of the TAVR treatment rates. And again, TAVR is a little faster than the rest of the company. But I don't have that number handy. But hopefully that gives you a sense for it's been happening on a pretty steady basis, and we expect the system to continue to adapt and evolve and add capacity. Although we don't expect it to happen kind of overnight, it will be more gradual nature.\nMatt Miksic: Super. Thanks so much, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please state your question.\nWilliam Plovanic: Great. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on one of the comments just on the international TAVR business, I think, approaching 20%. I'd be a little surprised that, that would be a pretty significant change for Europe, if it's starting to approach 20%. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little more clarity on kind of how that -- that growth rate between Europe, Japan and maybe rest of the world looks? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, we typically don't give country-by-country growth rates. But that we did experience 20% constant currency growth outside the U.S. And that most of the geographies around the world were all in that 20% range and that included Europe and Japan, and other places in the world were dramatically under penetrated. So, all that is a big positive. In the case of Europe, it was broad based across many countries. I mean, every country just grew in the first quarter. Now some of that might have been the fact that it was a little tougher last year, but nonetheless, it was very impressive to us and here it is a product that was launched in 2007. Now it's 15 years later and still growing at this kind of pace, tells you that in some ways the system is still catching up with what the demand is -- that's out there, and what gives us optimism for the future. So, on a long-term basis, do we expect Europe to grow 20%? No, we don't. But we'd be very pleased if Europe can continue to be an important contributor to growth. We haven't tried to parse long-term growth rates out, but I have to tell you that it's exceeded our expectations in the recent past.\nScott Ullem: I just add to that, Mike, one of the benefits of having this now significant TAVR business with a global footprint is we do have different regions contributing to growth at different times. And so, we've got new technologies that get introduced to different markets, new indications that are issued on TAVR devices in different markets. And so, it really helps to have this broad footprint. And if one business is performing, maybe not as weak -- not as strong in one period, then that could be offset by another region that is.\nWilliam Plovanic: Excellent. Thanks. And then if I could just on the U.S., I mean, I think is we're looking at the comp seem pretty tough as we get into Q2 on U.S TAVR. U.S., the first quarter for U.S was --- felt like it was kind of flattish sequentially. And I'm just trying to figure out, do you expect something similar that you're seeing into the TMTT is where we'll get more of a kind of keep recovering in Q2 on TAVR. And then maybe that really steps up as we get into the back half of the year, even in the U.S. Is that how we should think about it?\nMike Mussallem: Well, your point is a good one about tough comp in Q2 for TAVR. We saw a really strong growth. I mean, it was mind boggling, something that we didn't expect Q2 of last year. Now having said that, so we expect a real step up in our Q2 sales in TAVR. Again, we're going to see what we think is probably an all-time record for TMTT in the second quarter as well. But we say TMTT is really going to take off in the second half. TAVR is not going to come down probably from Q2. We expect that probably to just continue to increase, be a little stronger in Q3 and stronger yet in Q4. So, we expect a continuous ramp there of really setting all-time highs.\nWilliam Plovanic: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nShagun Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. Mike and Scott, I just wanted to ask the guidance question in a different way. So, your Q1 results and Q2 guidance, it does imply a pretty substantial improvement in the back half. And you've kept your guidance intact since December 9, despite a pretty dramatic shift in the operating environment, just given Omicron inflation, supply disruptions, staffing shortages, worse FX environment. And so, I'm just wondering, what's improved on an underlying basis since your December outlook? Is it International TAVR, TMTT? Or was your guidance just conservative?\nScott Ullem: That\u2019s a good question. Back in December, it was before Omicron had really been introduced in the U.S., and we're still seeing Delta in Europe, but in January, we saw a pretty noticeable impact of Omicron in the U.S. And we talked about a little bit on the fourth quarter call. We talked -- say about how conditions generally improved since January. But I don't think we'd say that conditions have improved all the way back to what we still saw back in our December Investor conference. So, things are better, but maybe not all the way back to what we had foreseen back in December at our Investor conference.\nMike Mussallem: Yes, and just a pile on there, and I don't have exact numbers behind this. But even though we've seen a pretty nice recovery here, not sure that the hole that was created for Omicron has been filled at this point. And that's still in the future. So, we have a pretty good-sized guidance range. And so, we continue to feel comfortable that will be within that guidance range. But we haven't fully filled the hole from Omicron yet.\nShagun Singh: Got it. And just to follow-up on capital, can you just comment on the capital environment in 2022, just given the exposure, you have, I guess, on the Critical Care side. But just generally, as you talk to hospital customers, are you worried about a slowing capital purchasing environment, especially in the midst of labor cost inflation and high interest rates that's ongoing? Thank you for taking the questions.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks for the question. We're not maybe the perfect barometer. For capital, we have a pretty good capital business, but it's only about 20% of overall Critical Care. And so, part of what we saw, we saw a pretty good recovery that started last year. Started last year, probably in Q2, and a pretty big capital recovery and part of that's in our comparables when we look at this year. So, we think that that is -- it was been pretty impressive and that we think we expect it to repeat this year, but not be greater than it was last year. It was a pretty -- it was pretty significant last year. And so, from our view, at least the way people are purchasing HemoSpheres, we saw quite a recovery from what we saw in the early days of the pandemic.\nShagun Singh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nCecilia Furlong: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on TMTT guidance for '22 and the expected acceleration in the back half, but really how much of that is coming from current sites and further penetration in the -- in those sites versus either additional site expansion or geographic expansion that you talked about?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, it's a great point. Part of this is not to have COVID interfere. Just it seems as though COVID has traditionally impacted mitral is a little bit more than it has TAVR by comparison just because we still require anesthesia and some ICU stays with the mitral procedure. So, some of it is that, but probably new sites is a bigger contributor than the increased adoption in existing sites. And so hopefully that gives you a little color on what we're expecting.\nCecilia Furlong: That's helpful. And then just in terms of your TMTT, the sales force build out that you've talked about in U.S., can you just walk through where you are at this point and expected future investments over the coming quarters ahead of launch? Thank you.\nMike Mussallem: Yes. So, we're in the process of building that U.S field team. And we're building with the idea that we really want to ensure that we do a great job of training our own team, and trainings of physicians, and really doing this in a very deliberate fashion. So, it's going to be a pretty gradual and deliberate build out for us. And we're going to focus on having excellent procedural success and clinical outcomes. And so, we're taking a pretty thoughtful approach to this, rather than broad base. We're going to try and stay in accounts that already do quite a bit of a transcatheter and have real experience in doing it and are likely to be able to attain a high level of competency and maintain that. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of how we're thinking about it.\nCecilia Furlong: Thank you for taking the questions.\nMike Mussallem: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good evening, Mike, Scott and Mark. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on  question pertaining to SAPIEN X. Hopefully, if you could maybe share the drive behind some of the design enhancements so that the  as you start the ALLIANCE trial, with the design enhancements focused on eliminating mild PVL facilitating future TAVR and TAVR procedures or coronary access or anything you can share would be helpful. And my follow-up is just on the Alterra Transcatheter Pulmonary valve, the Medtronic Harmony  valve recall today was announced or at least hit the tape. How big is that transcatheter pulmonary valve market, and what do you have baked into guidance for Alterra this year? And then could there be upside with this recall? Thanks for taking both questions.\nMike Mussallem: Sure. Well, we have -- we certainly have design intent and SAPIEN X4. We believe that it's going to have improved paravalvular leak performance. We also think that it's going to have RESILIA tissue on it, which we think is a big plus and add durability. And it also just has a chance to address some of the variability that's in patients. And so, we think it has a number of advantages and we look forward to trying that out. In terms of the pulmonic opportunity, I really haven't gotten into the news today that's happened on that. We're just now rolling out the Alterra product. We've been pleased with that. This isn't a really large group. I think compared to the overall TAVR market, it probably gets lost in the numbers. It's not really that big of an opportunity, but boy, these are patients that really, really need the help and so we feel a real obligation to be able to help them through a tough time.\nJosh Jennings: Understood. Understood. Thank a lot, Mike.\nMike Mussallem: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRick Wise: Good afternoon, Mike and Scott. One question for each of you. Mike, you're conveying very clearly your excitement about PASCAL and the acceleration you expect throughout the year. You said it's really going to take off. I was just hoping you could give us a little more color. Is this about the sales force expansion? Is it the number of centers opened, is it about training? All the above I'm sure, but just maybe help us better understand the fundamentals behind your optimism?\nMike Mussallem: Yes. Thanks, Rick. Well, maybe it's something that just a clarifying point is, remember, we're just selling in Europe at this point.\nRick Wise: Exactly.\nMike Mussallem: And so, when you talk about this transcatheter edge-to-edge therapy, the supporting evidence in Europe hasn't been overwhelmingly positive, it's been somewhat mixed. And so that's led to a growth rate in Europe, that's been probably less than what it should be. And we think there's going to be a real contribution when the family of class trials become apparent, we think has a chance to really lift market adoption. And that's going to be one of the pluses. And then as I said earlier, adding new sites is going to be a positive us growing, the team is going to be positive and all those are going to be additional add ons.\nRick Wise: Great. And maybe just last for me and I'm guessing this for Scott. You bought $400 million worth of stock, clearly balance sheets in excellent shape, free cash flow strong. Given the market, the pressure is on the group on Edwards stock price, what's your appetite now? How are you thinking about stock repo as we move through the second quarter? And is there anything else on your mind from a cash use perspective? Thank you so much.\nScott Ullem: Sure. Thanks for the question. Thanks for bringing us home a little bit over the time. So, I'll try to go quickly here. But our cash priorities have not changed at all. First and foremost, we invest in the business. But eventually, we're also going to end up with a lot of cash. And we intend to at least offset the impact of incentive compensation dilution. But beyond that, we've been gradually over time buying down the overall share count. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do that. We got off to a good start with a $400 million repurchase this year, we'd like where the stock was from a repurchase standpoint. And we still have over $700 million left in repurchase authorization. So, you should expect that that's going to be just part of our long-term capital deployment plan.\nRick Wise: Thank you so much.\nMike Mussallem: Okay. Thanks so much for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone later on.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. We are encouraged by our start to the year. Despite the impact from Omicron early in the quarter, all product groups performed well and sales were balanced across all regions. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.341 billion, which represents 12.7% year-over-year underlying growth. This strong sales performance fell through to our operating income, and we achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Assuming no new COVID headwinds, and a gradual improvement in U.S hospital staffing shortages, we're projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion, which represents sequential organic growth from the first quarter partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter to be our lowest of the year, given our strong prior year sales performance. We were also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.69. Although we haven't fully overcome the January Omicron impact, we are maintaining all of our previous full year sales guidance ranges for 2022, despite more pronounced foreign exchange headwinds and COVID-related hospital staffing challenges in the U.S. As a reminder, for total Edwards, we expect sales of $5.5 billion to $6 billion; for TAVR $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion; for TMTT $140 million to $170 million; for Surgical Structural Heart $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care $820 million to $900 million. We're also maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.50 to $2.65, representing mid-teens growth over 2021. And now I will cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.8% compared to 76.0% in the same period last year. As we expected, this improvement was driven by the positive impact from foreign exchange, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the yen. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from foreign exchange hedged gains and improved product mix and partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $370 million or 27.6% of sales, reflecting field-based personnel-related costs and commercial activities in support of our growth. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percentage of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high touch model for TAVR, and ongoing build out of the TMTT commercial team. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $229 million, or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in are transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14.4%, excluding the impact of special items. This is slightly higher than the midpoint of our full year guidance range, because it included the unplanned impact of U.S tax regulations published in Q1. These regulations potentially limit the amount of foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S income taxes. We continue to expect our full year tax rate excluding special items to be 11% to 15%, including an estimated benefit of three percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. Foreign exchange rates decreased our first quarter reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points, or $27 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $170 million negative impact, or about 3% to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021 versus our previous expectation of a $100 million negative impact. We forecast this additional $70 million negative impact to sales will occur over the remainder of the year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 240 basis points compared to the prior year. Although this benefits our operating margin rate relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share. As we mentioned at the Investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted, but as a result of financial and natural hedges margin rates benefit resulting in little impacts to the bottom line. At current rates, our operating margin in 2022 is benefiting by approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $221 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $294 million, less capital spending of $73 million. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow will be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. This includes approximately $200 million of accelerated tax payments due to a change in the tax treatment of research and development expenses. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 3 million to 629 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between 630 million to 635 million. And with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike. Larry, on your second question regarding guidance, we always guide people to the middle of a range just for modeling purposes. So, at 13.60, or $1.360 billion to $1.440 billion, the midpoint of that is $1.4 billion. So that's a good modeling assumption. Your math is right, which is year-over-year underlying growth for Q2 with that range is in the range of about 5.5%. And yes, it's 4.4% of these exchange rates sequentially from Q1. So sequentially up from Q1. And really for the full year, it doesn't change our underlying growth rate and our guidance of low double digits. And so, while FX is impacting our dollar guidance ranges, it hasn't had a big impact to our underlying growth expectations. I just add to that, Mike, one of the benefits of having this now significant TAVR business with a global footprint is we do have different regions contributing to growth at different times. And so, we've got new technologies that get introduced to different markets, new indications that are issued on TAVR devices in different markets. And so, it really helps to have this broad footprint. And if one business is performing, maybe not as weak -- not as strong in one period, then that could be offset by another region that is. That's a good question. Back in December, it was before Omicron had really been introduced in the U.S., and we're still seeing Delta in Europe, but in January, we saw a pretty noticeable impact of Omicron in the U.S. And we talked about a little bit on the fourth quarter call. We talked -- say about how conditions generally improved since January. But I don't think we'd say that conditions have improved all the way back to what we still saw back in our December Investor conference. So, things are better, but maybe not all the way back to what we had foreseen back in December at our Investor conference. Sure. Thanks for the question. Thanks for bringing us home a little bit over the time. So, I'll try to go quickly here. But our cash priorities have not changed at all. First and foremost, we invest in the business. But eventually, we're also going to end up with a lot of cash. And we intend to at least offset the impact of incentive compensation dilution. But beyond that, we've been gradually over time buying down the overall share count. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do that. We got off to a good start with a $400 million repurchase this year, we'd like where the stock was from a repurchase standpoint. And we still have over $700 million left in repurchase authorization. So, you should expect that that's going to be just part of our long-term capital deployment plan."

            "name": "Mike Mussallem",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I remain very proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient focused strategy. Throughout the first quarter, our supply chain delivered, and our field team continued to support the skilled clinicians and patients who count on Edwards. We continue to believe that 2022 will be an important year for Edwards Lifesciences as we expect low double-digit sales growth and meaningful progress on our pursuit of significant opportunities to improve patient care. Looking beyond 2022, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. Our patient focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world, and our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. As we're hopeful, the worst of the pandemic is behind us, we're constantly reminded of the importance of our work as we pursue solutions for cardiovascular disease, which continues to be the number one killer in the U.S and the world well ahead of cancer and other deadly conditions. Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Sales of $1.3 billion, increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Despite the impact that Omicron had on hospital capacity, resources and procedure volumes in January, especially in the U.S., Q1 global sales were moderately better than our expectations. Sales were lifted by performance outside the U.S where we experienced a less pronounced impact from the pandemic. Underlying sales growth was double-digit across all regions and benefited from improving trends as we progress through the first quarter. In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $881 million, an increase of 14% on an underlying basis with continued strong growth outside the U.S. We estimate that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our own growth, and average selling prices were stable globally. In the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew approximately 10% versus the prior year, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. TAVR adoption was broad based across hospitals, and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance. Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. We continue to see excellent opportunities for OUS growth, as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low. In Europe, Edward sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based across all countries. Our treatment rates recovered nicely throughout the quarter, although they differ by country, reflecting variable COVID impacts. We estimate that our competitive position was stable. In Japan, we also experienced strong TAVR adoption and the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement. Following reimbursement approval last year for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. And broadly across the globe, we continue to see encouraging TAVR adoption in many underpenetrated countries. In addition to geographic expansion, we remain focused on helping more patients gain access to TAVR therapy. In Q1, we continue to advance two pivotal trials aimed at expanding indication. First, our early TAVR trial for the large group of patients with severe AS and no diagnosed symptoms. And second, our PROGRESS trial that is evaluating patients with moderate AS, which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. We also remain on track to begin treating patients this quarter in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next generation TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. In summary, assuming no new COVID headwinds and a gradual improvement in U.S hospital staffing shortages throughout the year, we continue to plan for underlying TAVR sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 15%. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Now turning to TMTT. To transform patient care and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we continue to make steady progress on three key value drivers, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real world clinical outcomes. We are pleased with our high procedural success rates, and we continued our strong momentum with more patients than ever treated with our TMTT technologies this quarter. In mitral repair, we continue to achieve excellent clinical outcomes with PASCAL as we expand commercially and treat more patients in Europe. We remain on track for U.S approval of PASCAL Precision for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation late this year, supported by our Class IID pivotal trial. We continue to advance the enrollment of CLASP IIF pivotal study for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. And later this year, we expect European approval of our new PASCAL Precision system, which is engineered for enhanced navigation and an intuitive user experience extending our differentiated platform. In mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement technologies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study EVOQUE Eos. This early experience with these sub 30 French transfemoral therapies gives us confidence that these platforms have the potential to transform treatment for the many patients in need. Turning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies. As we continue to build a body of clinical evidence for PASCAL in the tricuspid position, we're pleased with the recently presented late breaking data at the ACC meeting last month. We are encouraged by the sustained significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation and improvements in quality-of-life measures experienced by patients and look forward to bringing additional clinical evidence through our Class IITR pivotal trial which is currently enrolling. In addition, we continue to make progress in enrolling our TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE system. We expect a late 2022 approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe, and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today. Turning to our results, first quarter global TMTT sales were $27 million driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe. Although there was an impact from COVID early in the quarter, we exited march with positive momentum. As we expand in Europe, physicians continue to achieve high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes. Assuming a diminishing COVID-related impact, we are planning a gradual ramp in Q2 and a significant acceleration in the second half of the year to reach our 2022 sales guidance of $140 million to $170 million. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. In Surgical Structural Heart, the first quarter 2022 global sales of $221 million increased 6% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start to the year associated with COVID, we were encouraged by the steady improvement across most regions over the course of the quarter driven by increased penetration of premium technologies and procedure growth. Although hospital staffing shortages remain a concern, we believe that lifesaving surgical therapies continued to be prioritized. At the end of March, we announced the U.S FDA approval and commercial launch of our e MITRIS RESILIA valve, which adds to the portfolio of durable RESILIA tissue products with a valve designed for the heart's mitral position. Built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions. Today, nearly 60% of the world's surgical mitral valves are mechanical. RESILIA tissue should allow patients to thrive without the quality-of-life compromises that may come from having a mechanical valve. Initial feedback from U.S surgeons has been very positive. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for a surgical structural heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies. In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $212 million increased 11% on an underlying basis, driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Demand for our state-of-the-art hemisphere monitoring platform remains strong and lifted our sales. Our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors and our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices supported the increased number of patients in the ICU in the first quarter. Additionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI SMART-BP trial focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support the adoption of our Hypotension Predictive Index software. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, which are moderated by the strong prior year comparisons over the remainder of the year. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care Innovations as we continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks, Scott. So we're confident in our long-term outlook for strong sales growth and our teams remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership coupled with a robust product pipeline positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue significant opportunities to improve patients' lives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Yes. Thanks, Larry. So let me start out with the progress of the recovery. It's a little different, obviously, when you go around the globe. And I think the recovery that I'll talk about first is the U.S recovery, and I think that probably has the biggest impact on Edwards results and why it would be meaningful. Big picture, we're not sure that U.S hospitals have really fully recovered from COVID. There's still a bit of a hangover of protocols. And, more importantly, we -- this issue that relates to the significant labor crunch and churn in the workforce is meaningful. Those workforce shortages are real. They're having an effect on staffing and their costs and they're just in the front of mind of a lot of the health care industry. And some of this is churn, and some of this is just openings that are yet to be filled. Now in our conversation with hospital executives, systems are aggressively working to address these challenges and they expect the dynamic to improve, but we're anticipating gradual improvement in our forecasts. And I'd say overall, Edwards procedure growth, we've fared pretty well on a relative basis. We're mindful that these systems have been extraordinarily challenged, but we're still able to grow pretty handily in this tough environment. Yes. Yes, thanks, Robbie. We don't have perfect visibility into the patient funnel. It's just kind of limited and we get a lot of our data from conversations with health care providers and our own frontline clinical specialists that really helped give us some perspective. And certainly, we believe that there's a small COVID-related backlog at this point, but we think that that's relatively small by compare, because I think the positive experience the clinical outcomes that people are having, but this is a story yet to be told. And so, we're going to have to live this one. Okay. Yes, we think at this point, we're starting to approach about 850 centers in the U.S. And at this point, it's possible for there to be additional centers added, we still have some centers that approach us, but we think are going to be relatively few at this point. And we also think that they're going to probably tend to be smaller centers, and probably not have a dramatic impact on the overall numbers. But hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're at and what we're projecting. Yes. So, it's easy to get lost in the pandemic, because we've had so many ups and downs. Maybe what I'll do is just remind you of what the company has been able to do over this period since 2019. And if you look at -- whether you're looking at the first quarter or full year 2022, we're looking at a 10% growth rate compounded annual growth rate. So, 10% each year from 2019 to now -- so 3 years, which gives you a sense that even with all of the constraints and incredible distractions and all the pressures that have been on systems, there's been a pretty continuous lifting of the TAVR treatment rates. And again, TAVR is a little faster than the rest of the company. But I don't have that number handy. But hopefully that gives you a sense for it's been happening on a pretty steady basis, and we expect the system to continue to adapt and evolve and add capacity. Although we don't expect it to happen kind of overnight, it will be more gradual nature. Yes, we typically don't give country-by-country growth rates. But that we did experience 20% constant currency growth outside the U.S. And that most of the geographies around the world were all in that 20% range and that included Europe and Japan, and other places in the world were dramatically under penetrated. So, all that is a big positive. In the case of Europe, it was broad based across many countries. I mean, every country just grew in the first quarter. Now some of that might have been the fact that it was a little tougher last year, but nonetheless, it was very impressive to us and here it is a product that was launched in 2007. Now it's 15 years later and still growing at this kind of pace, tells you that in some ways the system is still catching up with what the demand is -- that's out there, and what gives us optimism for the future. So, on a long-term basis, do we expect Europe to grow 20%? No, we don't. But we'd be very pleased if Europe can continue to be an important contributor to growth. We haven't tried to parse long-term growth rates out, but I have to tell you that it's exceeded our expectations in the recent past. Well, your point is a good one about tough comp in Q2 for TAVR. We saw a really strong growth. I mean, it was mind boggling, something that we didn't expect Q2 of last year. Now having said that, so we expect a real step up in our Q2 sales in TAVR. Again, we're going to see what we think is probably an all-time record for TMTT in the second quarter as well. But we say TMTT is really going to take off in the second half. TAVR is not going to come down probably from Q2. We expect that probably to just continue to increase, be a little stronger in Q3 and stronger yet in Q4. So, we expect a continuous ramp there of really setting all-time highs. Yes, and just a pile on there, and I don't have exact numbers behind this. But even though we've seen a pretty nice recovery here, not sure that the hole that was created for Omicron has been filled at this point. And that's still in the future. So, we have a pretty good-sized guidance range. And so, we continue to feel comfortable that will be within that guidance range. But we haven't fully filled the hole from Omicron yet. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're not maybe the perfect barometer. For capital, we have a pretty good capital business, but it's only about 20% of overall Critical Care. And so, part of what we saw, we saw a pretty good recovery that started last year. Started last year, probably in Q2, and a pretty big capital recovery and part of that's in our comparables when we look at this year. So, we think that that is -- it was been pretty impressive and that we think we expect it to repeat this year, but not be greater than it was last year. It was a pretty -- it was pretty significant last year. And so, from our view, at least the way people are purchasing HemoSpheres, we saw quite a recovery from what we saw in the early days of the pandemic. Yes. So, it's a great point. Part of this is not to have COVID interfere. Just it seems as though COVID has traditionally impacted mitral is a little bit more than it has TAVR by comparison just because we still require anesthesia and some ICU stays with the mitral procedure. So, some of it is that, but probably new sites is a bigger contributor than the increased adoption in existing sites. And so hopefully that gives you a little color on what we're expecting. Yes. So, we're in the process of building that U.S field team. And we're building with the idea that we really want to ensure that we do a great job of training our own team, and trainings of physicians, and really doing this in a very deliberate fashion. So, it's going to be a pretty gradual and deliberate build out for us. And we're going to focus on having excellent procedural success and clinical outcomes. And so, we're taking a pretty thoughtful approach to this, rather than broad base. We're going to try and stay in accounts that already do quite a bit of a transcatheter and have real experience in doing it and are likely to be able to attain a high level of competency and maintain that. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of how we're thinking about it. Sure. Sure. Well, we have -- we certainly have design intent and SAPIEN X4. We believe that it's going to have improved paravalvular leak performance. We also think that it's going to have RESILIA tissue on it, which we think is a big plus and add durability. And it also just has a chance to address some of the variability that's in patients. And so, we think it has a number of advantages and we look forward to trying that out. In terms of the pulmonic opportunity, I really haven't gotten into the news today that's happened on that. We're just now rolling out the Alterra product. We've been pleased with that. This isn't a really large group. I think compared to the overall TAVR market, it probably gets lost in the numbers. It's not really that big of an opportunity, but boy, these are patients that really, really need the help and so we feel a real obligation to be able to help them through a tough time. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Rick. Well, maybe it's something that just a clarifying point is, remember, we're just selling in Europe at this point. And so, when you talk about this transcatheter edge-to-edge therapy, the supporting evidence in Europe hasn't been overwhelmingly positive, it's been somewhat mixed. And so that's led to a growth rate in Europe, that's been probably less than what it should be. And we think there's going to be a real contribution when the family of class trials become apparent, we think has a chance to really lift market adoption. And that's going to be one of the pluses. And then as I said earlier, adding new sites is going to be a positive us growing, the team is going to be positive and all those are going to be additional add ons. Okay. Thanks so much for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone later on."

Bernard?\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Mark, and welcome, everyone. At our recent Investor Conference, I introduced our exciting vision of a new era of structural heart innovation to address significant unmet patient needs. Today, I will build on that theme and share key highlights of our team's strong performance in 2023 as well as our confidence in 2024. We are pleased with our strong 2023 financial performance, with full year sales up 12% to $6 billion, including strong growth across each of our four product groups. We invested more than $1 billion in research and development, and we achieved key strategic milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and indication expansion to ensure sustainable healthy growth in the near, mid, and long term. We exited the year with strong momentum, with Q4 growth of 13% and TAVR growth of 12%. These results were better than expected, driven by our broad portfolio of innovative therapies. In 2024, we are well-positioned to enter a new era of structural heart innovation. In TAVR, we are strengthening our leadership. We are experiencing strong adoption of our flagship SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and continuing enrollment in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for next-gen TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. In January, we achieved very important milestones with the completion of enrollment in PROGRESS, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large as severe aortic stenosis. This randomized trial enrolled approximately 750 patients two years ahead of schedule. At TCT, later this year, we plan to present data from EARLY TAVR, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of patient with severe aortic stenosis, but without symptoms. We believe that all of these initiatives position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. In TMTT, we achieved significant milestones with continued PASCAL global expansion and the introduction of EVOQUE in Europe. In Germany, EVOQUE was recently granted NUB Reimbursement Status 1, a very important step in therapy adoption. I am also pleased to announce that EVOQUE recently became the first transcatheter therapy to receive US FDA approval for the treatment of TR patients. This is an exciting development for a wide range of US patients. It will enable access to a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to significantly improve their quality of life, but also shows favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention, and heart failure hospitalization. With the ongoing introduction of EVOQUE, we are now offering a unique and broad portfolio of transcatheter repair and replacement solution for mitral and tricuspid patients. In addition, the completion of enrollment in the pivotal trial studying SAPIEN M3 puts us on track to further enhance our portfolio. I am confident that we are reaching an inflection point as the only company with a commercially approved portfolio of catheter-based technologies to treat the millions of patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease. In addition to the meaningful progress of TAVR and TMTT, we are pleased with the company innovative RESILIA tissue, which was pioneered by our surgical business. We are on track to treat half a million patients with RESILIA-based heart valve by the end of 2024, supported by seven years of clinical evidence. The previously announced spin-off of Critical Care is progressing as planned and will enable a sharpened focus on structural heart. As a result, Edwards' 2025 organic sales growth rate will be even more distinguished. In addition, this will give us more agility, increase our pace of innovation, and provide an expanded opportunity to serve a large and growing patient population. Because we are solely focused on structural heart disease, we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and extend our leadership. Now, I will provide some additional details by product group. In TAVR, our full year 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 10.6% year-over-year. Our US and OUS sales growth rates were similar. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales of $979 million increased 12% year-over-year. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the US, Europe, and Japan. The company competitive position was stable globally, and local selling price were also stable. In the US, we remain pleased with the continued expansion and adoption of a SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform. This technology builds on Edwards' longstanding leadership in tissue technology and durability by combining advancements in tissue science with the industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA -- Ultra valve. Developing safe, effective, and durable heart valve requires significant long-term commitment, and we are proud to build on 65 years on valve innovation while leveraging the expertise and know-how of more than 2,000 engineers and R&D specialists across the company. We are proud of uninterrupted leadership in structural heart and will continue to invest vigorously in these platforms. In addition, our scaling of patient activation initiative along with next-gen TAVR and additional evidence on asymptomatic and moderate AS patients, position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. Outside of the US, in the fourth quarter, our double-digit growth was comparable with our global TAVR growth, driven by Europe and Japan. Long term, we continue to anticipate excellent opportunities for growth, as international adoption of TAVR therapy remain quite low in many regions. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. It is encouraging that the growth in Q4 was widespread across all major countries. Looking ahead, we are pleased with the recently announced CE Mark approval for SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, and we are planning for a disciplined launch. We were pleased with our sales growth in Japan, and as expected, we grew faster than overall procedural growth. After more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience and over 1 million patients treated with SAPIEN valve around the world, our TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong sustainable growth. Given the under-treatment rates, we are confident in the future of TAVR, driven by greater awareness, patient activation, a platform that delivers lifetime management for AS patients, advances in new technologies. such as RESILIA, as well as indication expansion and increased global adoption. Turning to TMTT now. In 2023, we remained focused on our key value drivers to unlock the significant long-term opportunity for patients, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. Based on the deep learnings we have achieved from our clinical trial and real-world experiences, we have carefully constructed a strategic portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral and tricuspid patients. PASCAL Precision, EVOQUE, and SAPIEN M3 will provide best-in-class therapies to treat the broadest range of patients. Full year global sales of $198 million increased 67% versus the prior year. TMTT's fourth quarter sales of $56 million increased 71% versus the prior year. Q4 sales were driven by the accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform and activation of more centers across the US and Europe. We were encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth of overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which highlights the large unmet patient need. We continue to expand global access of PASCAL Precision in new countries, including Japan, where we recently completed our first cases. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 20,000 patients around the globe with PASCAL repair system. In mitral replacement, we have received FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Physicians are continuing to treat patients with this novel therapy. In tricuspid replacement, we initiated the launch of EVOQUE in Europe, with a focus on outstanding outcomes and the goal of eliminating tricuspid regulation in patients. And in the US, following the recent early FDA approval, we are initiating the introduction of its novel therapy and building the foundation for long-term expansion. As we did for TAVR, we are focusing on best-in-class physician training, generating more evidence, and achieving excellent patient outcomes. We are grateful for the strong ongoing collaboration with clinicians all over the world to provide the treatment options to many patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In tricuspid repair, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well and remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year. As a summary for TMTT, we are reaching an inflection point with the only portfolio of approved catheter-based mitral and tricuspid technologies. We remain committed to bringing our differentiated therapy to patients with this live threatening disease and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In our surgical product group, full year global sales of $999 million increased 13% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter global sales of $248 million increased 10%. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA technology and overall procedural volumes. We are confident about the future of its tissue technology and its role in improving patient lifetime management. We continue to see positive momentum in our innovation globally with continued adoption for patients best treated surgically, including those with complex and concomitant procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our MOMENTIS clinical study, we received CE Mark approval of our MITRIS RESILIA valve in the fourth quarter and have begun to launch in several European countries with favorable physician feedback. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $928 million increased 10% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $250 million increased 11%. Growth was driven by contribution from all product lines, led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Critical Care strategy is to drive growth through Smart Recovery and Smart Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Okay. Thanks a lot, Bernard. So today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2023, including detailed results of our fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. As Bernard mentioned, we were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.53 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included one-time expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2024 with the exception of TMTT. Absent big moves in foreign exchange, we expect total company sales of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion; TAVR sales of $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion; Surgical Structural Heart sales of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion; and Critical Care sales of $900 million to $1 billion. Given the early FDA approval for EVOQUE, we now expect full year TMTT sales to be at the higher end of our previous $280 million to $320 million guidance range. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.66. And now, I'll cover the additional details from our P&L. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 81% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by a significant impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $480 million or 31.3% of sales compared to $411 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and patient activation initiatives. We continue to expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives and increase our focus on efficient G&A leverage. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect research and development to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth with the goal of treating even more patients. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $17 million of one-time costs associated with our previously announced spin-off of Critical Care. Additional one-time costs will be incurred throughout 2024 prior to the expected separation at year-end. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.3%, or 13.4% excluding the impact of special items. For the full year 2023, our reported tax rate was 12.4% or 15.0% excluding the impact of special items. Our lower-than-expected non-GAAP rate in the fourth quarter benefited primarily from US tax credits on foreign remittances and income tax. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 80 basis points or $9 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 320 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $48 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $136 million less capital spending of $88 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $943 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $896 million less capital spending of $253 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.0 million shares through an accelerated repurchase agreement and a pre-established 10b5-1 plan. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 607 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back to you, Bernard.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. In conclusion, we are proud of the significant progress we made in 2023, advancing new breakthrough therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance and healthy profitability. We are even more excited about 2024. This year, we anticipate launching groundbreaking technologies and advancing multiple important clinical trials. These breakthroughs, along with significant unmet patient needs, give us confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. In TAVR, we will continue to drive global adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, present pivotal trial data from EARLY TAVR, studying asymptomatic AS patients, and enroll in ALLIANCE, a pivotal trial studying the next-generation SAPIEN X4. We also look forward to a number of key developments in TMTT, including the US and European introduction of EVOQUE, the expanded global adoption of PASCAL Precision, CLASP II TR enrollment completion, and SAPIEN M3 approval in Europe by the end of 2025. And in Surgical and Critical Care, we remain committed to healthy growth and expanded leadership. In closing, longer term for Edwards, we are confident in our plan to expand the structural heart opportunity, which reflects our sharpened focus on valvular and non-valvular patients and our commitment to innovation. We believe that executing our strategy will create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, back to you, Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Bernard. With that, we're ready to take everyone's questions. As a reminder, please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the early approval of EVOQUE in the US. I feel like I need to start there. So, I'd love to hear you guys talk about your commercialization plan for EVOQUE. Are you ready to launch now? Should we expect a price premium? And talk about the reimbursement pathway? Should we expect you to file an NCD? And I had one follow-up.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Larry. I hope you are doing well. Let me start and then I will ask Daveen to add some color here. So, first, the way we are thinking about this one is like we did in TAVR, we want to make sure that we are going to introduce this very novel therapy, having in mind, building foundation for long-term expansion. So, we're going to be focusing on physician training, generating more evidence, excellent patient outcome, making sure we have coverage, payment, reimbursement, established in the US and in Europe. So, we are having here a long-term view, the same way we did in TAVR in last 20 years. But again, Daveen, I'm sure you want to share some of your plan.\nDaveen Chopra: No, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I'll start by saying, of course, we are very excited by this approval coming through the FDA breakthrough pathway. This innovation is obviously the first transcatheter technology in the US to change the life of the many patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation. As we look at kind of our rollout model, as Bernard said, we are really planning a controlled rollout of this technology, focused on great clinical outcomes. And we're really going to start with those centers that -- who are in a clinical trial, and then over time, will grow it to new centers. We're going to have a dedicated team of clinical case support who has been training on the over 1,000 EVOQUE cases that now have been done to-date. And this team will continue to scale as we move forward. Specifically, on your question on -- I think I heard a question about NCD in there and the kind of timing. Obviously, with EVOQUE, it's a parallel review technology. So, CMS is working on the national coverage kind of on their own process, and we are continuing to work with them to kind of provide information to help support their process. So, as we all hear more about that, you guys will definitely [indiscernible] that.\nLarry Biegelsen: Super helpful.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Daveen. So, what you can see, Larry, here, we have a long-term view on this one. We want to shape the space in a way that we like, in a way that everybody is going to be very proud of, like we did for TAVR.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Daveen, just one follow-up for you. What are your thoughts on the likelihood of seeing a statistically significant mortality benefit at one year or 18 months when the full TRISCEND II data is presented at TCT? And how important is that for adoption and reimbursement? Thanks.\nDaveen Chopra: Well, I think right now, as we've talked about, we've obviously shown very favorable trends in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations and tricuspid regurgitation. And those were some of the key trends that'll help us lead to our approval. Obviously, our full data set will come at TCT in the fall with one-year follow-up, and it's hard to speculate on what that data will show.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a very nice data. Maybe just to follow up on that. We've seen just TMTT, in general, whether it's mitral or tricuspid maybe ramp over the past few years a little slower than expected. Obviously, COVID really disrupted that, that upward trajectory. Maybe just speak to some of the bottlenecks that you see in the system, especially with tricuspid replacement, it's a totally new therapy. There will be some education, I imagine. But maybe just speak to what you see as the bottlenecks and what Edwards can do to help ramp adoption in a pretty sick patient population?\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Robbie. So let me start on your earlier comment about a little slower than expected in the past years. And then, Daveen can talk about a bottleneck in the system. So, if you think about it, since the beginning, since six years ago, when we put together this vision, we did study this patient population, mitral and tricuspid, and we knew that they were very complex and diverse. And we knew from the beginning that one device, one therapy, a repair technology only will not be sufficient. Repair technology, and we are very pleased about PASCAL, but can only treat some -- a small proportion of patients. So it is why we have this vision of having a portfolio. So right now, what we have is this portfolio on the tricuspid side, we are on track to get also a mitral replacement. And what we are going to see, what we are going to see altogether is an acceleration. Clinicians will be able to treat more patients. So, the dynamic in the next 10 years is going to be very different than the dynamic in the last 10 years. But again, Daveen...\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah, I'll make a couple of quick comments. First, we're really excited, because we see that the replacement technology really has the potential to treat a large number of patients. Because especially in tricuspid regurgitation, note one patient is alike. There's really a huge heterogeneity and replacement will really see as the core of treating the largest number of patients, and then we see other technologies like [TEER] (ph) as well as other modalities that are still in trials potentially to add new patient groups on top of that. We've seen in Europe where tricuspid as a therapy has been approved longer that centers are starting to continue to build up and grow the tricuspid practice. As you bring in technology to market, you start seeing the awareness of the disease to grow and you see more referrals and you see more patients getting to the heart team. And some of that becomes from how we imaging people correctly and we're referring them correctly at centers. And we can see that, that's exactly what we see potentially that will happen out with the new therapy of tricuspid in the US. We'll be able to start building up diagnosis referral to heart teams. And also, we see that there's an opportunity, as Larry talked about in the investor conference, in the TAVR group, we're doing so much with patient activation. And we see that all those learnings from patient activations in the future will be able to be leveraged over to the TMTT space, both for mitral and tricuspid to continue to grow the market.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. I appreciate that. Maybe one on the TAVR market. We have the exciting data from EARLY TAVR coming later this year at TCT. How do you think about what that does to the TAVR market growth going forward? Do you put up double-digit growth in the fourth quarter? That's what guidance includes over the next few years for the most part. How do you think about what's coming from low intermediate and high risk and severe? And then, how do you think about what asymptomatic adds? Is that just what helps keep you at double digit, or can that help accelerate growth? Thanks.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. Thanks. This is Larry. That's a great question. I think the first thing is we're just going to learn a lot from this trial. There's a lot of unknown questions out there in terms of what percentage of patients are truly asymptomatic when subjected to a stress test. I think how fast do people progress and what happens to people while they're waiting. I think the biggest thing about it is, as we've talked about, and I spent a lot of time at the investor conference, the time from a patient to get diagnosed or treated is just really long. And a lot of that is the interpretation of the guidelines and this overlay of symptoms. And it's all really stand in the gears preventing the patients from moving through. And unfortunately, given the deadliness of the disease, a lot of people never actually make it to therapy. I think with the EARLY TAVR trial, assuming that it's successful, it will just streamline that process where we can just apply guideline criteria to aortic stenosis, and it won't require this additional evaluation of symptoms and people can just move through. But remember, only about 13% of patients right now with severe aortic stenosis actually get treated. So there's a huge under-treatment right now. We think asymptomatic just adds to that.\nBernard Zovighian: In addition, Robbie, what I like is our commitment to -- after 20 years of TAVR, we are still super committed to bring big evidence. Look at these two trials, PROGRESS and EARLY TAVR, this is a potential, for sure, to learn more, but also to expand indication to change the guidelines. So, as a leader in the space, for sure, we like it, we are committed. But I believe that in the next 10 years, here in TAVR, we are going to see some very exciting things happening.\nLarry Wood: Yeah, I think that's right. And I think it's sort of returned to a little bit of the earlier days in TAVR, where I think we're planning on having a steady cadence of new trials and new data and new evidence that continues to not only raise awareness about the therapy, but also open up new opportunities for patients to get treated that don't currently get treated today.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe talking about EVOQUE over a multiyear period, just curious how you think that market develops compared to the mitral market, if you think that goes faster or slower? And when you think about the data that we have so far, it seems like replacement is doing better than clipping. So, I don't know if you think about the mechanism of action why replacement would be better than clipping and kind of where you see a place for clipping in the market in tricuspid?\nBernard Zovighian: Go ahead?\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. So, I guess I'll start off with the latter part of your question about the technology. As I kind of mentioned, we see that in replacement where you're able to really eliminate tricuspid regurgitation, we see an awesome opportunity to help patients and really improve their quality of life. And we see kind of replacement with its broad applicability really being able to treat a large chunk of those tricuspid regurgitations, the vast majority of tricuspid regurgitation patients. But there's still -- but again, based on the disease state and the heterogeneity of tricuspid regurgitation, there's still going to be many patients where replacement may not make sense for anatomical or other considerations, where whether it's a clasping technology or other modality may make sense. Back to your first question about how the market develops related to mitral, I think we see continued strength in this. We think the mitral market had some early strength in kind of slowdown during COVID. We think that the tricuspid market, as referrals and awareness of the disease continues, we'll continue to kind of grow at a very strong rate at rates that we think they can kind of probably exceed kind of mitral, especially with the two modalities entering the market in a very similar time, you now have an opportunity to treat a larger proportion of patients.\nTravis Steed: Helpful. And a follow-up, curious on the SMART trial. If the data there is good? If you think there's an impact on the market? And then also, there was news last week, when last competitor comes to the market in 2024. Does that change your view on 2025? I'm just curious what kind of competition you had kind of baked into your long-term guidance. Thanks a lot.\nLarry Wood: Sure. With regard to this [market] (ph) trial, I think we'll just have to wait and see the trial, and we don't know what it's going to show. But I think the key thing is thinking about how physicians select TAVR valves for their patients. And that's really a multi-factorial decision. I think you have to look at mortality rates, stroke, future interventions, all those things. And hemodynamics is certainly, you know, one consideration, but I don't think it's even a driving consideration compared to some of the other factors that are probably higher on the hierarchy for patients. In terms of the competitive space, we didn't have a lot in 2024 because it was expected the approval was going to come late. We know it takes time to ramp a new therapy. We'll have to see what the impact on 2025 is and what the revised approval timing is. And there's no real value in me speculating on that.\nBernard Zovighian: Yeah. And in addition, as me being in my first year as CEO, I'd like to reflect a little bit about where we are as a company. And when I think about valve, making heart valve, it is not easy. Given the nature of patient needs, this is not luck. We are committed and focused for more than 60 years and we bring experience, a very deep knowledge. What we have seen, even in the past few years, many platforms, many companies coming in and leaving the market after a year, two years or three years. So, we are leading the space with a very significant long-term commitment, more than 2,000 engineers, R&D, R&D specialists. We are proud of our uninterrupted leadership in the space. And we are going to continue investing. So, look, for sure, we take all the competitors very seriously, but we are very confident about our leadership, about our technologies, and about our evidence.\nTravis Steed: Great. And congrats again on the EVOQUE approval.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nPatrick Wood: Amazing. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess maybe for the first one on TAVR in Japan, in general, do you think you've been taking back some share post-trialing? It sounded like you feel very good about the market, and you have taken back some share on that side. Just any color you could give there would be great.\nLarry Wood: Sure. I think what happens when new technology comes into Japan, just because of the way the certification process works and people having to move through that process, that certainly had an impact for us. I think in Q4, we grew faster than the market. And I think that really relates to some of the trialing ending and people kind of moving back to our platform. But this is sort of something that goes on, but we're very pleased with how we grew in Japan in Q4 and continue to look forward to that market growing because it's a very -- it's a much lower penetrated market than places like the US and Europe. So we continue to see that as a long-term growth driver for us.\nPatrick Wood: That's very helpful. And then just quickly as a follow-up, I get this might be difficult to comment on, but the faster-than-expected approval of EVOQUE, what in your discussions with the FDA? And what do you think they placed a great weight on in getting it comfortable with it into market faster than expected? Do you think there was like one area of data or sense of the products because that's obviously not been the experience for everyone? So just curious to get any thoughts there.\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. No, sure. This is Daveen again. I'll kind of jump in this one. Obviously, we received an approval through this FDA breakthrough pathway. And this was a really innovative pathway where the basis of approval was the breakthrough cohort of the 150 patients we presented at TCT. But at the same time, as we were working with the FDAs and answering their questions, we presented and gave them other data from our larger cohort, other descriptive statistics. And as we mentioned, it's that larger cohort where the results really showed those favorable trends in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, tricuspid reinterventions. It was those kinds of trends that I think that we believe probably have the FDA come back to us and say, oh, yeah, this kind of makes sense. We probably don't need an advisory panel that led to our approval. And so, we're very excited that the full cohort of data, the full one-year cohort on the 400 patients will be presented at TCT, so we can kind of see all the data, not just kind of the breakthrough cohort plus the initial kind of look at the other data. And that going forward, right, for us, as we launch out this therapy, we're going to continue to have a great deal of evidence. We're going to continue to have trials and more data that help show how great this therapy really could be for patients. We're planning to build this therapy with really careful physician training, great clinical outcomes, and supporting this therapy just like we as an organization did for TAVR not that long ago. And so, I'm excited really for that long-term opportunity and what this means for helping patients.\nPatrick Wood: Looking forward to it. Thanks again for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on a nice print here. Maybe on the last question on EVOQUE, Daveen, you made some comments here about the totality of data. But I'm curious on -- when you think about the market development, is there like a bar, like do we need to see a stat significance in mortality? Like, there's a reason this valve was called forgotten valve. So I'm curious what wakes up physicians to take this valve seriously, maybe compare in contrast on how this adoption curve could look like versus I don't know if TAVR is a good example, but I would love your comments.\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. No, I'll start off a little bit first on the totality of data. Now with EVOQUE, we've implanted and tracked data in clinical trials on over 1,000 patients in various studies. And what we've consistently seen is that these patients are patients who don't have an option. There are patients who are looking for options out there and don't feel great and can't do the things that they want to do every day in their life, and that -- the EVOQUE technology really makes a huge difference in their life. This concept, the quality of life really does matter for patients to be able to pick up -- play with your grandkids, walk up the stairs. It really does matter. And I'm not trying to discount that these other statistics matter, right, mortality, heart failure hospitalization. Those all matter as well. But we've, I think, shown in the breakthrough cohort that we at the starting point have this amazing quality of life improvement. And that's why our indications about improvement in health status. We've got the favorable trend in the other data points, all cohorts mortality, heart failure hospitalization, tricuspid intervention. And those favorable trends, we'll continue to see more data as we go in the future. But as I mentioned before, we're going to continue beyond just this study, the tricuspid [indiscernible]. We're going to continue to gather data on patients. We're going to continue to gather large data on large numbers of patients to help show how EVOQUE can really help patients. And I think it's that kind of data, along with kind of all the other key things we talked about, careful physician training, controlled rollout, excellent outcomes, that will really help create this market and really do the market development. And so, it's hard for me to speculate how will this compare maybe the technologies like TAVR, same question about mitral, but I'm excited for what it can do. I think there's so much opportunity to grow this market.\nBernard Zovighian: Yeah. Thank you, Daveen. Well said. And we are very excited. Think about TAVR, 20 years later, we are still generating evidence. We are still innovating with Ultra RESILIA X4. We still believe that there is a way for TAVR to grow healthy double digit in the many years to come globally. So here, for TMTT EVOQUE, it's probably thinking the same. It is not the next five years, it's like 10 or 20 years here that we are thinking of.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. Just, just to pile on that, having spent so much time in the TAVR space, when we deal with regulators and with payers and stuff, there's a lot of focus on mortality and people get really almost singularly focused on it. But spending the time with the patient groups that I spend, living longer, but living poorly is not a feature to them. If you told them they had this exact same life expectancy, but their quality of life would dramatically improve, that's far more valuable to them. And I think when you can get that quality of life improvement and you can get the mortality benefit, that's where you really have the home run therapy like what we've seen with TAVR. And so that's really what we're trying to build on. But I wouldn't discount the quality of life benefits. They're really significant for patients.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. That's helpful. And maybe, Scott, one quick one for you on this Q1 EPS guide. I think at the midpoint, it's slightly below Street. I'm curious on what's driving that. Is that a step up in OpEx? Or is that a gross margin or below-the-line sort of issue that's impacting Q1 EPS?\nScott Ullem: Yeah. It's a couple of things, but largely it relates to just the lumpiness of SG&A and R&D and in what period we record those expenses. Q1, the increase in OpEx will outpace revenue according to our current forecast. And that's the reason why we end up with the midpoint of the range of $0.64 level with the EPS from the fourth quarter. But overall, it's important to remember that for the full year, we're expecting bottom-line growth to exceed top-line growth once you get through the different quarter-to-quarter cadence.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you if you thought that the delays that your competitors having in the US would have any impact on international markets. Does it provide you an opportunity to gain any share? Does it change anything?\nLarry Wood: We'll have to see what the impact is. Certainly, we've seen cases where US data has impacted international share in international markets. I think it just depends on what the data is. But I think the reality is there's been no data released. All those data just simply a signal that they're delaying their approval and waiting for additional data. So, I don't know that how much people are going to react to that. The other thing is there's more that goes into to the purchasing decision oftentimes, especially in Europe than clinical data. And for the people that are purchasing on price because there's favorable pricing and it's a significant discount, I don't know how much that will get impacted.\nMatt Taylor: Got you. And can I ask one follow-up on -- you mentioned the activation of patients a few times. I know you're doing a lot there. Are you doing anything new and different there, or is it kind of more of the same? I just was noticing the call-outs on this call?\nLarry Wood: I think we continue to do a lot of new things. We're running a number of programs. I think one of the things that I talked about at the investor conference is I know there's a lot of speculation on -- and skepticism, frankly, on the under-treatment rates and are all those patients really there. I can tell you we've done enough work in major health systems where we've applied things like AI to the echo reports, and we can absolutely definitively say the patients are there. They're just not moving through the system for a variety of reasons. So, the first thing you have to do is validate. The second thing you have to do is get people to understand what to do about it, and then you have to move them through the process and get treated. And we have multiple things that we're working on to drive those patients through, but we are literally continually evolving these programs to try to optimize them to activate patients off the sidelines and move them through the system in a streamlined fashion.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks a lot, Larry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So, I had one on EVOQUE and one follow-up on margins if I could. So, not to put too fine a point on it, but moving from the middle of your TMTT range to the high end is like $10 million to $20 million. And so, if we think about EVOQUE came about five, six months early. Does that tell us what we need to know about your sort of expectations for the run rate this year knowing what we know now, I guess, in EVOQUE as we just get started in the US? And then I have one follow-up.\nDaveen Chopra: No, Matt. Thanks so much for the question. It's Daveen again. Yeah, if you first look at the timing of it, right, we kind of said midyear was kind of our initial estimation, and midyear has got a couple of months kind of window. So this definitely was up by a couple of months earlier than we kind of expected. And so, based on what we know now, we continue to be confident in what we think EVOQUE can do. And obviously, we'll see as we get through adoption and we start moving through centers, training how fast the rate is, but that help us bring this up just a little bit. I think the other comment I'll make is things like new technology add-on payments, right, which are helpful for hospitals to help ensure that they're adequately kind of profitable and doing a good job comes online October 1, and that date doesn't really change whether you get earlier approval or late approval. So, there are some factors like that. But we'll continue to look at as we adapt over the course of the year and how it grows and give updates as -- if needed.\nMatt Miksic: That's great. And then the follow-up on the margins in Matt's question just now on the activities that you're getting after in the field. So, you hired these folks in -- I guess, in the fourth quarter, which is part of the step up in spending there. Just wondering, first, does that have an impact in Q4? Can you talk a little bit about the benefits that you're seeing so far from those investments in that? Second, are you continuing those investments? Or to your point earlier, Scott, about like leverage against those investments, are you kind of done and now it's about achieving leverage against sort of a set additional spend that you put into the field? Thanks.\nScott Ullem: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, we're just getting started with building out our field force both for EVOQUE, but as well as we continue to expand the presence of our overall TMTT portfolio. And so this is the beginning of an investment in building a foundation of a team in the field, not the end. You should expect that we're going to continue to grow our resources, invest in the field team. And by the way, that's not limited just to TMTT. TAVR continues to grow aggressively, and we're investing more resources to support that growth as well. One of the things we're doing, though, is looking carefully at general and administrative expenses globally. And as Edwards has put down a broader global footprint, it gives us an opportunity to get some leverage from scale. And so, we're going to be continuing to look closely at that and making sure that we're being as efficient as we can be on the P&L.\nMatt Miksic: Okay. And then, the TAVR side, did you see any results you feel from these field activations and patient activation efforts in Q4? Or is that something that's still to come? Thanks.\nScott Ullem: Yeah. Matt, I think we saw some benefit from patient activation initiatives that we have in place. It's tough to isolate those from the other efforts that we have underway to continue to support the growth of TAVR. But no, that's certainly helping drive growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nLarry Wood: Just to add on to this, I mean, I think it'd be incorrect to say our patient activation efforts are just starting to pay dividends now. We've been doing patient activation for the last, I don't know, five or six years through our digital campaigns through some of our website stuff, some of our patient resources, some of the general cardiology awareness events we do and a number of other things that have been driving this. So, I think patient activation has been contributing all the way along the way. I think what we're talking about now, though, is a much more sophisticated approach and program to really tapping into these untreated patients that are in the system, but hospitals don't really realize that they're there, and how do we bridge those gaps. And that's really where our activation now is because we know the patients are there. We know they're diagnosed with an echo, but they're not moving. And so, it's just a matter of tapping into those patients in the right way and getting the accelerated through the system.\nBernard Zovighian: What's fair to say though is, in the past few years, we have done many pilots, many initiatives. We have extracted so many learnings. What we are doing right now is scaling. We are scaling and spending. We are spending resources in Q4 last year, this year, and the next few years. So, you are going to see more and more because we believe there are so many patients in need not receiving a treatment.\nMatt Miksic: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please state your question.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. I think I heard you mention patient activation, not just with regard to TAVR, but also as an important part of the EVOQUE rollout. I was encouraged to hear from a lot of physicians back at TCT, they're actually seeing many more of these tricuspid patients in their practice. So, as you think about the initial launch here, do you expect to have to do a lot of work establishing referral channels? Or do you think there are already a large number of these patients identified and waiting for treatment?\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. Hey, Chris. This is Daveen. No, I appreciate it. I think at least my reference toward in patient activation and how we think about in TMTT is more over the longer term, right? And we think about there's so much learning that TAVR is happening where, yeah, we're doing some things right now, we're testing small things, but it's really about over the midterm, how do we kind of help scale patient activation in a way that kind of TAVR has been doing and really helps drive kind of organic growth and a number of patients being diagnosed and being referred to our teams. Well, the other point I'll kind of make is that, right now, I think that most of our time or a lot of our energy is really about building capabilities for getting centers up and running. So, there are a lot of patients in the center. If you look at how our trials enrolled, especially the TRISCEND II trial, it enrolled really fast and enrolled very quickly. So, we know there's definitely groups of patients who now are looking for options. They've been diagnosed and looking for options. But as we grow over time, we're going to continue to try to build off that and leverage a lot of those kind of TAVR kind of patient activation efforts.\nChris Pasquale: That's helpful. Thanks. And then a lot of focus, I think, rightly so on the new US products. But you've got a couple in Europe, SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and MITRIS RESILIA both rolling out there. Are the price premiums for those products in Europe the same as what we see in the US? And do you think you can get similar adoption in what is a more price sensitive market? Thanks.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. I'll start, and then if Wayne has anything to add, he can. The price premiums are different in the different markets because it all depends on kind of where the starting price was. So, we went for larger premiums in Europe than what we did in the US. And so, a more price sensitive market, obviously, that's more of an issue. So, we've seen more rapid adoption of our RESILIA-based therapies in the US. But we continue to see this growing in Europe. And I think we're really gaining momentum on our RESILIA platforms in total. I don't know, Wayne, did you have anything to add?\nWayne Markowitz: Maybe just a couple of things I'd add was just if you think about our global adoption of the RESILIA premium technologies, we're also seeing tremendous growth out of the emerging markets. And a lot of those emerging markets are finding and identifying patients that can be best treated surgically with RESILIA portfolio. So it's been certainly a global effort, but strong growth out of the emerging markets even with premium technology, which is encouraging to see too.\nChris Pasquale: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Larry, just a quick question for you on the PROGRESS trial in moderate aortic stenosis. I mean, I know this isn't the first time we're hearing about the speed of enrollment in that trial that it's certainly a positive signal. And I guess my question for you is, is there anything to read into the potential opportunity there based on the speed of enrollment? Was there anything unique about the trial that allowed us to enroll so much faster than you guys expected? And what could this mean for potential approval, number one; but number two, just more broadly, once we see this data uplift across the market?\nLarry Wood: Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. I think clinical trial enrollment, I think, is always an important marker for the opportunity. And I think having rapid clinical trial enrollment, I think, does certainly speak to that opportunity. I think it also speaks to the fact that everything we've done in the PARTNER series of trial has still been just isolated to severe aortic stenosis. And most of that work is, is it better to do surgeries or better to do TAVR. What I think there's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about now is actually attacking the disease in a different way and saying, should we be waiting until patients are literally at the end stage before we even consider doing anything, or should we be evaluating those patients sooner. And I think that could have two benefits. The first is, if we showed that treating moderate patients is important and has real advantages for those patients, then I think it could provide a real accelerant for those severe patients that aren't moving today. And I think we've seen that when we went from high risk to intermediate risk, we have the intermediate risk approvals, one of the biggest accelerations we saw was in the high-risk space. Because people are like, for having to debate in the intermediate, then high risk are automatic at this point. But I think the other thing about it is if we can show a benefit in these moderate patients, there's literally twice as many moderate patients as there are severe patients. And so, when we think about long-term and just continual opportunities to drive the market, I think that steady cadence of data with early TAVR coming later this year at TCT, and then we're talking about a couple of years, two and a half years later, we get the PROGRESS trial, that steady cadence of data, we think is going to be important for informing patients and improving treatment rates.\nDanielle Antalffy: That makes sense. I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much, guys.\nBernard Zovighian: So, in closing, I am very proud about what we did last year. 2023 was a great year. Strong performance across our four product groups globally. When I think about this year 2024, I'm super excited. We are going to have multiple breakthrough technologies, clinical trial in TAVR, TMTT and surgical. Here, we have a chance. The same way we did it in TAVR 20 years ago to shape the TMTT space with EVOQUE and providing basically a toolbox to physician to treat so many patients. So, that's a very unique opportunity that we are taking very seriously. The speed of critical care, we are executing on this one also in 2024. So I'm super confident that this year is going to be a super exciting year and we are going to be very well positioned to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. So with that, thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks a lot, Bernard. So today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2023, including detailed results of our fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. As Bernard mentioned, we were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.53 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included one-time expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2024 with the exception of TMTT. Absent big moves in foreign exchange, we expect total company sales of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion; TAVR sales of $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion; Surgical Structural Heart sales of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion; and Critical Care sales of $900 million to $1 billion. Given the early FDA approval for EVOQUE, we now expect full year TMTT sales to be at the higher end of our previous $280 million to $320 million guidance range. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.66. And now, I'll cover the additional details from our P&L. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 81% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by a significant impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $480 million or 31.3% of sales compared to $411 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and patient activation initiatives. We continue to expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives and increase our focus on efficient G&A leverage. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect research and development to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth with the goal of treating even more patients. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $17 million of one-time costs associated with our previously announced spin-off of Critical Care. Additional one-time costs will be incurred throughout 2024 prior to the expected separation at year-end. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.3%, or 13.4% excluding the impact of special items. For the full year 2023, our reported tax rate was 12.4% or 15.0% excluding the impact of special items. Our lower-than-expected non-GAAP rate in the fourth quarter benefited primarily from US tax credits on foreign remittances and income tax. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 80 basis points or $9 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 320 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $48 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $136 million less capital spending of $88 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $943 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $896 million less capital spending of $253 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.0 million shares through an accelerated repurchase agreement and a pre-established 10b5-1 plan. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 607 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back to you, Bernard. Yeah. It's a couple of things, but largely it relates to just the lumpiness of SG&A and R&D and in what period we record those expenses. Q1, the increase in OpEx will outpace revenue according to our current forecast. And that's the reason why we end up with the midpoint of the range of $0.64 level with the EPS from the fourth quarter. But overall, it's important to remember that for the full year, we're expecting bottom-line growth to exceed top-line growth once you get through the different quarter-to-quarter cadence. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, we're just getting started with building out our field force both for EVOQUE, but as well as we continue to expand the presence of our overall TMTT portfolio. And so this is the beginning of an investment in building a foundation of a team in the field, not the end. You should expect that we're going to continue to grow our resources, invest in the field team. And by the way, that's not limited just to TMTT. TAVR continues to grow aggressively, and we're investing more resources to support that growth as well. One of the things we're doing, though, is looking carefully at general and administrative expenses globally. And as Edwards has put down a broader global footprint, it gives us an opportunity to get some leverage from scale. And so, we're going to be continuing to look closely at that and making sure that we're being as efficient as we can be on the P&L. Yeah. Matt, I think we saw some benefit from patient activation initiatives that we have in place. It's tough to isolate those from the other efforts that we have underway to continue to support the growth of TAVR. But no, that's certainly helping drive growth in the fourth quarter and beyond."

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks. This is Larry. That's a great question. I think the first thing is we're just going to learn a lot from this trial. There's a lot of unknown questions out there in terms of what percentage of patients are truly asymptomatic when subjected to a stress test. I think how fast do people progress and what happens to people while they're waiting. I think the biggest thing about it is, as we've talked about, and I spent a lot of time at the investor conference, the time from a patient to get diagnosed or treated is just really long. And a lot of that is the interpretation of the guidelines and this overlay of symptoms. And it's all really stand in the gears preventing the patients from moving through. And unfortunately, given the deadliness of the disease, a lot of people never actually make it to therapy. I think with the EARLY TAVR trial, assuming that it's successful, it will just streamline that process where we can just apply guideline criteria to aortic stenosis, and it won't require this additional evaluation of symptoms and people can just move through. But remember, only about 13% of patients right now with severe aortic stenosis actually get treated. So there's a huge under-treatment right now. We think asymptomatic just adds to that. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think it's sort of returned to a little bit of the earlier days in TAVR, where I think we're planning on having a steady cadence of new trials and new data and new evidence that continues to not only raise awareness about the therapy, but also open up new opportunities for patients to get treated that don't currently get treated today. Sure. With regard to this [market] (ph) trial, I think we'll just have to wait and see the trial, and we don't know what it's going to show. But I think the key thing is thinking about how physicians select TAVR valves for their patients. And that's really a multi-factorial decision. I think you have to look at mortality rates, stroke, future interventions, all those things. And hemodynamics is certainly, you know, one consideration, but I don't think it's even a driving consideration compared to some of the other factors that are probably higher on the hierarchy for patients. In terms of the competitive space, we didn't have a lot in 2024 because it was expected the approval was going to come late. We know it takes time to ramp a new therapy. We'll have to see what the impact on 2025 is and what the revised approval timing is. And there's no real value in me speculating on that. Sure. I think what happens when new technology comes into Japan, just because of the way the certification process works and people having to move through that process, that certainly had an impact for us. I think in Q4, we grew faster than the market. And I think that really relates to some of the trialing ending and people kind of moving back to our platform. But this is sort of something that goes on, but we're very pleased with how we grew in Japan in Q4 and continue to look forward to that market growing because it's a very -- it's a much lower penetrated market than places like the US and Europe. So we continue to see that as a long-term growth driver for us. Yeah. Just, just to pile on that, having spent so much time in the TAVR space, when we deal with regulators and with payers and stuff, there's a lot of focus on mortality and people get really almost singularly focused on it. But spending the time with the patient groups that I spend, living longer, but living poorly is not a feature to them. If you told them they had this exact same life expectancy, but their quality of life would dramatically improve, that's far more valuable to them. And I think when you can get that quality of life improvement and you can get the mortality benefit, that's where you really have the home run therapy like what we've seen with TAVR. And so that's really what we're trying to build on. But I wouldn't discount the quality of life benefits. They're really significant for patients. We'll have to see what the impact is. Certainly, we've seen cases where US data has impacted international share in international markets. I think it just depends on what the data is. But I think the reality is there's been no data released. All those data just simply a signal that they're delaying their approval and waiting for additional data. So, I don't know that how much people are going to react to that. The other thing is there's more that goes into to the purchasing decision oftentimes, especially in Europe than clinical data. And for the people that are purchasing on price because there's favorable pricing and it's a significant discount, I don't know how much that will get impacted. I think we continue to do a lot of new things. We're running a number of programs. I think one of the things that I talked about at the investor conference is I know there's a lot of speculation on -- and skepticism, frankly, on the under-treatment rates and are all those patients really there. I can tell you we've done enough work in major health systems where we've applied things like AI to the echo reports, and we can absolutely definitively say the patients are there. They're just not moving through the system for a variety of reasons. So, the first thing you have to do is validate. The second thing you have to do is get people to understand what to do about it, and then you have to move them through the process and get treated. And we have multiple things that we're working on to drive those patients through, but we are literally continually evolving these programs to try to optimize them to activate patients off the sidelines and move them through the system in a streamlined fashion. Just to add on to this, I mean, I think it'd be incorrect to say our patient activation efforts are just starting to pay dividends now. We've been doing patient activation for the last, I don't know, five or six years through our digital campaigns through some of our website stuff, some of our patient resources, some of the general cardiology awareness events we do and a number of other things that have been driving this. So, I think patient activation has been contributing all the way along the way. I think what we're talking about now, though, is a much more sophisticated approach and program to really tapping into these untreated patients that are in the system, but hospitals don't really realize that they're there, and how do we bridge those gaps.

And so, it's just a matter of tapping into those patients in the right way and getting the accelerated through the system. Yeah. I'll start, and then if Wayne has anything to add, he can. The price premiums are different in the different markets because it all depends on kind of where the starting price was. So, we went for larger premiums in Europe than what we did in the US. And so, a more price sensitive market, obviously, that's more of an issue. So, we've seen more rapid adoption of our RESILIA-based therapies in the US. But we continue to see this growing in Europe. And I think we're really gaining momentum on our RESILIA platforms in total. I don't know, Wayne, did you have anything to add? Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. I think clinical trial enrollment, I think, is always an important marker for the opportunity. And I think having rapid clinical trial enrollment, I think, does certainly speak to that opportunity.

So it's been certainly a global effort, but strong growth out of the emerging markets even with premium technology, which is encouraging to see too."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "No, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I'll start by saying, of course, we are very excited by this approval coming through the FDA breakthrough pathway. This innovation is obviously the first transcatheter technology in the US to change the life of the many patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation. As we look at kind of our rollout model, as Bernard said, we are really planning a controlled rollout of this technology, focused on great clinical outcomes. And we're really going to start with those centers that -- who are in a clinical trial, and then over time, will grow it to new centers. We're going to have a dedicated team of clinical case support who has been training on the over 1,000 EVOQUE cases that now have been done to-date. And this team will continue to scale as we move forward. Specifically, on your question on -- I think I heard a question about NCD in there and the kind of timing. Obviously, with EVOQUE, it's a parallel review technology. So, CMS is working on the national coverage kind of on their own process, and we are continuing to work with them to kind of provide information to help support their process. So, as we all hear more about that, you guys will definitely [indiscernible] that. Well, I think right now, as we've talked about, we've obviously shown very favorable trends in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations and tricuspid regurgitation. And those were some of the key trends that'll help us lead to our approval. Obviously, our full data set will come at TCT in the fall with one-year follow-up, and it's hard to speculate on what that data will show. Yeah, I'll make a couple of quick comments. First, we're really excited, because we see that the replacement technology really has the potential to treat a large number of patients. Because especially in tricuspid regurgitation, note one patient is alike. There's really a huge heterogeneity and replacement will really see as the core of treating the largest number of patients, and then we see other technologies like [TEER] (ph) as well as other modalities that are still in trials potentially to add new patient groups on top of that. We've seen in Europe where tricuspid as a therapy has been approved longer that centers are starting to continue to build up and grow the tricuspid practice. As you bring in technology to market, you start seeing the awareness of the disease to grow and you see more referrals and you see more patients getting to the heart team. And some of that becomes from how we imaging people correctly and we're referring them correctly at centers. And we can see that, that's exactly what we see potentially that will happen out with the new therapy of tricuspid in the US. We'll be able to start building up diagnosis referral to heart teams. And also, we see that there's an opportunity, as Larry talked about in the investor conference, in the TAVR group, we're doing so much with patient activation. And we see that all those learnings from patient activations in the future will be able to be leveraged over to the TMTT space, both for mitral and tricuspid to continue to grow the market. Yeah. So, I guess I'll start off with the latter part of your question about the technology. As I kind of mentioned, we see that in replacement where you're able to really eliminate tricuspid regurgitation, we see an awesome opportunity to help patients and really improve their quality of life. And we see kind of replacement with its broad applicability really being able to treat a large chunk of those tricuspid regurgitations, the vast majority of tricuspid regurgitation patients. But there's still -- but again, based on the disease state and the heterogeneity of tricuspid regurgitation, there's still going to be many patients where replacement may not make sense for anatomical or other considerations, where whether it's a clasping technology or other modality may make sense. Back to your first question about how the market develops related to mitral, I think we see continued strength in this. We think the mitral market had some early strength in kind of slowdown during COVID. We think that the tricuspid market, as referrals and awareness of the disease continues, we'll continue to kind of grow at a very strong rate at rates that we think they can kind of probably exceed kind of mitral, especially with the two modalities entering the market in a very similar time, you now have an opportunity to treat a larger proportion of patients. Yeah. No, sure. This is Daveen again. I'll kind of jump in this one. Obviously, we received an approval through this FDA breakthrough pathway. And this was a really innovative pathway where the basis of approval was the breakthrough cohort of the 150 patients we presented at TCT. But at the same time, as we were working with the FDAs and answering their questions, we presented and gave them other data from our larger cohort, other descriptive statistics. And as we mentioned, it's that larger cohort where the results really showed those favorable trends in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, tricuspid reinterventions. It was those kinds of trends that I think that we believe probably have the FDA come back to us and say, oh, yeah, this kind of makes sense. We probably don't need an advisory panel that led to our approval. And so, we're very excited that the full cohort of data, the full one-year cohort on the 400 patients will be presented at TCT, so we can kind of see all the data, not just kind of the breakthrough cohort plus the initial kind of look at the other data. And that going forward, right, for us, as we launch out this therapy, we're going to continue to have a great deal of evidence. We're going to continue to have trials and more data that help show how great this therapy really could be for patients. We're planning to build this therapy with really careful physician training, great clinical outcomes, and supporting this therapy just like we as an organization did for TAVR not that long ago. And so, I'm excited really for that long-term opportunity and what this means for helping patients. Yeah. No, I'll start off a little bit first on the totality of data. Now with EVOQUE, we've implanted and tracked data in clinical trials on over 1,000 patients in various studies. And what we've consistently seen is that these patients are patients who don't have an option. There are patients who are looking for options out there and don't feel great and can't do the things that they want to do every day in their life, and that -- the EVOQUE technology really makes a huge difference in their life. This concept, the quality of life really does matter for patients to be able to pick up -- play with your grandkids, walk up the stairs. It really does matter. And I'm not trying to discount that these other statistics matter, right, mortality, heart failure hospitalization. Those all matter as well. But we've, I think, shown in the breakthrough cohort that we at the starting point have this amazing quality of life improvement. And that's why our indications about improvement in health status. We've got the favorable trend in the other data points, all cohorts mortality, heart failure hospitalization, tricuspid intervention. And those favorable trends, we'll continue to see more data as we go in the future. But as I mentioned before, we're going to continue beyond just this study, the tricuspid [indiscernible]. We're going to continue to gather data on patients. We're going to continue to gather large data on large numbers of patients to help show how EVOQUE can really help patients. And I think it's that kind of data, along with kind of all the other key things we talked about, careful physician training, controlled rollout, excellent outcomes, that will really help create this market and really do the market development. And so, it's hard for me to speculate how will this compare maybe the technologies like TAVR, same question about mitral, but I'm excited for what it can do. I think there's so much opportunity to grow this market. No, Matt. Thanks so much for the question. It's Daveen again. Yeah, if you first look at the timing of it, right, we kind of said midyear was kind of our initial estimation, and midyear has got a couple of months kind of window. So this definitely was up by a couple of months earlier than we kind of expected. And so, based on what we know now, we continue to be confident in what we think EVOQUE can do. And obviously, we'll see as we get through adoption and we start moving through centers, training how fast the rate is, but that help us bring this up just a little bit. I think the other comment I'll make is things like new technology add-on payments, right, which are helpful for hospitals to help ensure that they're adequately kind of profitable and doing a good job comes online October 1, and that date doesn't really change whether you get earlier approval or late approval. So, there are some factors like that. But we'll continue to look at as we adapt over the course of the year and how it grows and give updates as -- if needed. Yeah. Hey, Chris. This is Daveen. No, I appreciate it. I think at least my reference toward in patient activation and how we think about in TMTT is more over the longer term, right? And we think about there's so much learning that TAVR is happening where, yeah, we're doing some things right now, we're testing small things, but it's really about over the midterm, how do we kind of help scale patient activation in a way that kind of TAVR has been doing and really helps drive kind of organic growth and a number of patients being diagnosed and being referred to our teams. Well, the other point I'll kind of make is that, right now, I think that most of our time or a lot of our energy is really about building capabilities for getting centers up and running. So, there are a lot of patients in the center. If you look at how our trials enrolled, especially the TRISCEND II trial, it enrolled really fast and enrolled very quickly. So, we know there's definitely groups of patients who now are looking for options. They've been diagnosed and looking for options. But as we grow over time, we're going to continue to try to build off that and leverage a lot of those kind of TAVR kind of patient activation efforts."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and welcome, everyone. At our recent Investor Conference, I introduced our exciting vision of a new era of structural heart innovation to address significant unmet patient needs. Today, I will build on that theme and share key highlights of our team's strong performance in 2023 as well as our confidence in 2024. We are pleased with our strong 2023 financial performance, with full year sales up 12% to $6 billion, including strong growth across each of our four product groups. We invested more than $1 billion in research and development, and we achieved key strategic milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and indication expansion to ensure sustainable healthy growth in the near, mid, and long term. We exited the year with strong momentum, with Q4 growth of 13% and TAVR growth of 12%. These results were better than expected, driven by our broad portfolio of innovative therapies. In 2024, we are well-positioned to enter a new era of structural heart innovation. In TAVR, we are strengthening our leadership. We are experiencing strong adoption of our flagship SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and continuing enrollment in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for next-gen TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. In January, we achieved very important milestones with the completion of enrollment in PROGRESS, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large as severe aortic stenosis. This randomized trial enrolled approximately 750 patients two years ahead of schedule. At TCT, later this year, we plan to present data from EARLY TAVR, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of patient with severe aortic stenosis, but without symptoms. We believe that all of these initiatives position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. In TMTT, we achieved significant milestones with continued PASCAL global expansion and the introduction of EVOQUE in Europe. In Germany, EVOQUE was recently granted NUB Reimbursement Status 1, a very important step in therapy adoption. I am also pleased to announce that EVOQUE recently became the first transcatheter therapy to receive US FDA approval for the treatment of TR patients. This is an exciting development for a wide range of US patients. It will enable access to a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to significantly improve their quality of life, but also shows favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention, and heart failure hospitalization. With the ongoing introduction of EVOQUE, we are now offering a unique and broad portfolio of transcatheter repair and replacement solution for mitral and tricuspid patients. In addition, the completion of enrollment in the pivotal trial studying SAPIEN M3 puts us on track to further enhance our portfolio. I am confident that we are reaching an inflection point as the only company with a commercially approved portfolio of catheter-based technologies to treat the millions of patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease. In addition to the meaningful progress of TAVR and TMTT, we are pleased with the company innovative RESILIA tissue, which was pioneered by our surgical business. We are on track to treat half a million patients with RESILIA-based heart valve by the end of 2024, supported by seven years of clinical evidence. The previously announced spin-off of Critical Care is progressing as planned and will enable a sharpened focus on structural heart. As a result, Edwards' 2025 organic sales growth rate will be even more distinguished. In addition, this will give us more agility, increase our pace of innovation, and provide an expanded opportunity to serve a large and growing patient population. Because we are solely focused on structural heart disease, we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and extend our leadership. Now, I will provide some additional details by product group. In TAVR, our full year 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 10.6% year-over-year. Our US and OUS sales growth rates were similar. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales of $979 million increased 12% year-over-year. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the US, Europe, and Japan. The company competitive position was stable globally, and local selling price were also stable. In the US, we remain pleased with the continued expansion and adoption of a SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform. This technology builds on Edwards' longstanding leadership in tissue technology and durability by combining advancements in tissue science with the industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA -- Ultra valve. Developing safe, effective, and durable heart valve requires significant long-term commitment, and we are proud to build on 65 years on valve innovation while leveraging the expertise and know-how of more than 2,000 engineers and R&D specialists across the company. We are proud of uninterrupted leadership in structural heart and will continue to invest vigorously in these platforms. In addition, our scaling of patient activation initiative along with next-gen TAVR and additional evidence on asymptomatic and moderate AS patients, position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. Outside of the US, in the fourth quarter, our double-digit growth was comparable with our global TAVR growth, driven by Europe and Japan. Long term, we continue to anticipate excellent opportunities for growth, as international adoption of TAVR therapy remain quite low in many regions. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. It is encouraging that the growth in Q4 was widespread across all major countries. Looking ahead, we are pleased with the recently announced CE Mark approval for SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, and we are planning for a disciplined launch. We were pleased with our sales growth in Japan, and as expected, we grew faster than overall procedural growth. After more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience and over 1 million patients treated with SAPIEN valve around the world, our TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong sustainable growth. Given the under-treatment rates, we are confident in the future of TAVR, driven by greater awareness, patient activation, a platform that delivers lifetime management for AS patients, advances in new technologies. such as RESILIA, as well as indication expansion and increased global adoption. Turning to TMTT now. In 2023, we remained focused on our key value drivers to unlock the significant long-term opportunity for patients, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. Based on the deep learnings we have achieved from our clinical trial and real-world experiences, we have carefully constructed a strategic portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral and tricuspid patients. PASCAL Precision, EVOQUE, and SAPIEN M3 will provide best-in-class therapies to treat the broadest range of patients. Full year global sales of $198 million increased 67% versus the prior year. TMTT's fourth quarter sales of $56 million increased 71% versus the prior year. Q4 sales were driven by the accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform and activation of more centers across the US and Europe. We were encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth of overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which highlights the large unmet patient need. We continue to expand global access of PASCAL Precision in new countries, including Japan, where we recently completed our first cases. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 20,000 patients around the globe with PASCAL repair system. In mitral replacement, we have received FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Physicians are continuing to treat patients with this novel therapy. In tricuspid replacement, we initiated the launch of EVOQUE in Europe, with a focus on outstanding outcomes and the goal of eliminating tricuspid regulation in patients. And in the US, following the recent early FDA approval, we are initiating the introduction of its novel therapy and building the foundation for long-term expansion. As we did for TAVR, we are focusing on best-in-class physician training, generating more evidence, and achieving excellent patient outcomes. We are grateful for the strong ongoing collaboration with clinicians all over the world to provide the treatment options to many patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In tricuspid repair, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well and remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year. As a summary for TMTT, we are reaching an inflection point with the only portfolio of approved catheter-based mitral and tricuspid technologies. We remain committed to bringing our differentiated therapy to patients with this live threatening disease and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In our surgical product group, full year global sales of $999 million increased 13% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter global sales of $248 million increased 10%. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA technology and overall procedural volumes. We are confident about the future of its tissue technology and its role in improving patient lifetime management. We continue to see positive momentum in our innovation globally with continued adoption for patients best treated surgically, including those with complex and concomitant procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our MOMENTIS clinical study, we received CE Mark approval of our MITRIS RESILIA valve in the fourth quarter and have begun to launch in several European countries with favorable physician feedback. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $928 million increased 10% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $250 million increased 11%. Growth was driven by contribution from all product lines, led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Critical Care strategy is to drive growth through Smart Recovery and Smart Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. In conclusion, we are proud of the significant progress we made in 2023, advancing new breakthrough therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance and healthy profitability. We are even more excited about 2024. This year, we anticipate launching groundbreaking technologies and advancing multiple important clinical trials. These breakthroughs, along with significant unmet patient needs, give us confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. In TAVR, we will continue to drive global adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, present pivotal trial data from EARLY TAVR, studying asymptomatic AS patients, and enroll in ALLIANCE, a pivotal trial studying the next-generation SAPIEN X4. We also look forward to a number of key developments in TMTT, including the US and European introduction of EVOQUE, the expanded global adoption of PASCAL Precision, CLASP II TR enrollment completion, and SAPIEN M3 approval in Europe by the end of 2025. And in Surgical and Critical Care, we remain committed to healthy growth and expanded leadership. In closing, longer term for Edwards, we are confident in our plan to expand the structural heart opportunity, which reflects our sharpened focus on valvular and non-valvular patients and our commitment to innovation. We believe that executing our strategy will create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, back to you, Mark. Thank you, Larry. I hope you are doing well. Let me start and then I will ask Daveen to add some color here. So, first, the way we are thinking about this one is like we did in TAVR, we want to make sure that we are going to introduce this very novel therapy, having in mind, building foundation for long-term expansion. So, we're going to be focusing on physician training, generating more evidence, excellent patient outcome, making sure we have coverage, payment, reimbursement, established in the US and in Europe. So, we are having here a long-term view, the same way we did in TAVR in last 20 years. But again, Daveen, I'm sure you want to share some of your plan. Thank you, Daveen. So, what you can see, Larry, here, we have a long-term view on this one. We want to shape the space in a way that we like, in a way that everybody is going to be very proud of, like we did for TAVR. Thank you, Robbie. So let me start on your earlier comment about a little slower than expected in the past years. And then, Daveen can talk about a bottleneck in the system. So, if you think about it, since the beginning, since six years ago, when we put together this vision, we did study this patient population, mitral and tricuspid, and we knew that they were very complex and diverse. And we knew from the beginning that one device, one therapy, a repair technology only will not be sufficient. Repair technology, and we are very pleased about PASCAL, but can only treat some -- a small proportion of patients. So it is why we have this vision of having a portfolio. So right now, what we have is this portfolio on the tricuspid side, we are on track to get also a mitral replacement. And what we are going to see, what we are going to see altogether is an acceleration. Clinicians will be able to treat more patients. So, the dynamic in the next 10 years is going to be very different than the dynamic in the last 10 years. But again, Daveen... In addition, Robbie, what I like is our commitment to -- after 20 years of TAVR, we are still super committed to bring big evidence. Look at these two trials, PROGRESS and EARLY TAVR, this is a potential, for sure, to learn more, but also to expand indication to change the guidelines. So, as a leader in the space, for sure, we like it, we are committed. But I believe that in the next 10 years, here in TAVR, we are going to see some very exciting things happening. Go ahead? Yeah. And in addition, as me being in my first year as CEO, I'd like to reflect a little bit about where we are as a company. And when I think about valve, making heart valve, it is not easy. Given the nature of patient needs, this is not luck. We are committed and focused for more than 60 years and we bring experience, a very deep knowledge. What we have seen, even in the past few years, many platforms, many companies coming in and leaving the market after a year, two years or three years. So, we are leading the space with a very significant long-term commitment, more than 2,000 engineers, R&D, R&D specialists. We are proud of our uninterrupted leadership in the space. And we are going to continue investing. So, look, for sure, we take all the competitors very seriously, but we are very confident about our leadership, about our technologies, and about our evidence. Yeah. Thank you, Daveen. Well said. And we are very excited. Think about TAVR, 20 years later, we are still generating evidence. We are still innovating with Ultra RESILIA X4. We still believe that there is a way for TAVR to grow healthy double digit in the many years to come globally. So here, for TMTT EVOQUE, it's probably thinking the same. It is not the next five years, it's like 10 or 20 years here that we are thinking of. What's fair to say though is, in the past few years, we have done many pilots, many initiatives. We have extracted so many learnings. What we are doing right now is scaling. We are scaling and spending. We are spending resources in Q4 last year, this year, and the next few years. So, you are going to see more and more because we believe there are so many patients in need not receiving a treatment. So, in closing, I am very proud about what we did last year. 2023 was a great year. Strong performance across our four product groups globally. When I think about this year 2024, I'm super excited. We are going to have multiple breakthrough technologies, clinical trial in TAVR, TMTT and surgical. Here, we have a chance. The same way we did it in TAVR 20 years ago to shape the TMTT space with EVOQUE and providing basically a toolbox to physician to treat so many patients. So, that's a very unique opportunity that we are taking very seriously. The speed of critical care, we are executing on this one also in 2024. So I'm super confident that this year is going to be a super exciting year and we are going to be very well positioned to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. So with that, thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thank you, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Diego, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We are coming to you live from San Francisco at the 35th Annual TCT Conference. With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian; and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are, Larry Wood, our Group Vice President -- Group President, excuse me, of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; and Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of TMTT. Just after the close of regular trading Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2023 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings. All of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Unless otherwise noted our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\nBernard Zovighian: Good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, we are hosting today's call from TCT in San Francisco. I\u2019m going to start by covering some of the exciting developments at the conference, share highlights of the significant progress our team has made advancing our strategy, review our strong third quarter results, and finally, discuss our confidence in the outlook for Edwards. We have a lot of data being presented this week about technologies, Edwards has developed. Included among these are results from free late-breaking clinical trials, all of which reflects Edwards' commitment to generating high quality evidence, to advance innovative therapies for patients, suffering from structural heart disease. Yesterday, physicians presented five year data from the PARTNER 3 low risk pivotal trial. We believe these data demonstrate that TAVR with the SAPIEN platform should continue to be the preferred therapy for treating patients, who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Still more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experiences and trials, now eight New England Journal of Medicine Publication and over a million patients treated, SAPIEN technology offers patient unique benefits. SAPIEN 3 has demonstrated 99% freedom from death and disabling stroke at one year. 90% survival at five years and is the only valve with the THV and THV indication. This is true lifetime management benefit, which expands option for patients. Tomorrow at TCT, we are looking forward to the presentation of the six month analysis of our EVOQUE tricuspid valve, the first-of-its-kind of therapy for the millions of patients, suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In addition, tomorrow, you will receive a one year full cohort result of a CLASP IID pivotal trial with PASCAL. We continue to make meaningful progress to advance our vision of offering a portfolio of innovative transcatheter therapies to treat tricuspid and mitral valve disease. In the last several weeks, we achieved four important milestones in support of our commitment to patient-focused innovation. First, CE Mark approval for EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system. Second, CE Mark approval for the MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve. Third, PASCAL Precision approval in Japan. Finally, the competition of the enrollment in the first-ever pivotal trial for any transfemoral mitral replacement therapy the ENCIRCLE trial for SAPIEN M3. Turning now to Q3 financial performance. Third quarter global sales grew 11% to $1.5 billion, led by our differentiated portfolio of innovative therapies. We were pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectation and/or present another quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the full year, we continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Now, I will provide an overview of the third quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with third quarter sales of $961 million, up 10% year-over-year. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable. Our U.S. and OUS competitive positions were stable and globally, local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our third quarter TAVR sales were driven by the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. On the clinical side, we are pleased with the pace of enrollment in our pivotal trial alliance, designed to study SAPIEN X4, our groundbreaking next generation TAVR technology. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We look forward to additional data, supporting the Edwards' benchmark program to be presented at the PCR London Valve's Conference in November. Our sales in Japan grew year-over-year, reflecting a gradual recovery in market growth and strong adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. Competitive trialing in the third quarter were -- was less pronounced versus the first half of this year. And as expected, we grew faster than overall procedure growth. Around the world, we remain focused on improving diagnosis and treatment of the many more patients who remain undertreated. In summary, the combination of our global TAVR leadership, along with the data presented at TCT this week, gives the company further confidence in the future of TAVR, and the company's expectation of a $10 billion opportunity by 2028. Now, turning to TMTT. Our commitment to the unmet needs of mitral and tricuspid patients, took a significant step forward with the achievement of several important milestones in this past quarter. TMTT third quarter global sales of $52 million increased 65% versus the prior year. This performance was driven by accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL precision platform, the activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe, as well as key TEER (ph) procedural growth. We continue to be pleased with our excellent clinical outcomes, reflecting the impressive performance of PASCAL Precision and the value brought by our comprehensive high touch model. We are continuing the expansion of PASCAL Precision globally, with the expected launch in Japan before the end of the year. In our mitral clinical trials, we look forward to the one year CLASP IID randomized pivotal trial, and CLASP IID registry outcomes with PASCAL to be presented as part of a late breaking scientific sessions tomorrow at TCT. This will add to the body of evidence, supporting TEER (ph) as an effective therapy for patients. With the earlier than expected completion of enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3, we believe we are one step closer to offering an important valve replacement option, beyond TEER to serve even more patients, suffering from mitral valve disease. In tricuspid, earlier this month, we received CE Mark approval for EVOQUE. We look forward to bringing this new therapy to Europe through disciplined launch that will focus on ensuring excellent patient outcomes. Now, with this approval physicians in Europe will have access to this groundbreaking option in addition to TEER. As noted, tomorrow at TCT late breaking data from the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement technology will be presented on the first 150 randomized patients, based on EVOQUE's FDA breakthrough pathway designation. This landmark presentation on a novel therapy demonstrate our leadership and commitment to innovation and science, and our focus on helping large population of patients with unmet needs. In summary for TMTT, we are proud of the new therapy introductions, clinical trial achievements and geographic expansion. We have achieved to advance our vision to build a portfolio of therapies to transform lives of mitral and tricuspid patients. In surgical, third quarter sales of $247 million increased 11%, driven by a balanced combination of strong global adoption of Edwards' premium technology and overall procedural growth. We continue to see strong momentum of our RESILIA portfolio globally, which has been widely adopted, because of the excellent durability of its proven tissue technology, supported by the recent seven year aortic data and five year mitral data from our commenced clinical trial. We are confident about the future of this technology, as we expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our momentous clinical study. Finally, we received CE Mark approval for our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve earlier this month. We expect to introduce this valve in the fourth quarter, followed by full European launch in 2024. In Critical Care, third quarter sales of $221 million increased 6%, driven by a smart recovery portfolio, with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensors, equipped with the high potential prediction index algorithm. We remain confident in our pipeline of critical care innovation, as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies, designed to help clinicians make better decision and get patient home to their family faster. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Hey. Thanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased to report third quarter sales performance in line with our expectations, with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.48 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 benefited from a change in U.S. tax regulations. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for this and other items is included with today's release. I'll now cover some additional details of our third quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more balanced hospital staffing environment, as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year end. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based by country. In Japan improved growth in the third quarter was driven by the ongoing launch of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. For global TAVR sales, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion, representing 10% to 13% growth. TMTT growth in Q3 was driven by adoption of our differentiated PASCAL precision platform, activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe and strong procedure volumes. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress towards establishing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with temporary clinical data, in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We continue to expect full year 2023 TMTT sales of $180 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, 11% sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards RESILIA products, based on positive year-to-date performance, we continue to expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion, implying low double-digit growth in 2023. And in critical care, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based upon the performance we have delivered year-to-date, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and full year sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Lastly, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting fourth quarter sales to be between $1.45 billion and $1.53 billion. We are also projecting fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.60 and $0.66. Now, I'll cover additional details of our P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% as expected, compared to 81% in the same period last year. This year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Remember last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by an unusually positive impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $440 million or 29.7% of sales compared to $377 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field based personnel in support of our growth strategy and performance based compensation. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30%, as we invest in field based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the third quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies, and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.7% or 18.8%, excluding the impact of special items. Our reported rate benefited from the suspension of certain U.S. tax regulations, surrounding forward tax credits are slightly higher than expected non-GAAP rate, resulted primarily from income mix and a lower excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 13% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 140 basis points or $16 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $40 million year-over-year negative impact to full year 2023 sales, compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 410 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had a $0.01 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $356 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $411 million, less capital spending of $55 million. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. And before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, as of September 30. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares under our 10b5 plan. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $500 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back over to you, Bernard.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. In closing, after more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience over 1 million patients treated. In this week, five year PARTNER III results. Edwards TAVR is positioned for strong sustainable growth, as many patient remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, we have two strong global businesses, critical care and surgical, which our position for durable long-term growth driven by portfolios of differentiated technology. Moreover, we are achieving many, many significant milestones in TMTT, that gives us the confidence about progressing our vision to treat the many mitral and tricuspid patients in need. Altogether, we are convinced of the tremendous opportunity to drive success in the future through our patient focused, breakthrough technologies and leadership. With that, pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Bernard. Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to remind you about our 2023 investor conference, which we will host at our headquarters in Irvine, California, on Thursday, December 7. This event will include updates on our latest technologies, views on longer term market potential, as well as our outlook for 2024. More information and a registration form are available on our website. With that, we're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to start you guys did 11% TAVR growth in the quarter, roughly similar U.S., OUS. How do we think about what's holding it back here from being faster, pre-COVID it was growing at much higher rates. It's been one of the slower to recover, sub-sectors in med-tech. Data we presented this weekend, should be supportive of growth. But what gives you confidence this going to remain a double-digit growth market for the foreseeable future.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Robbie. Let me start and then I will ask, Larry, to continue here. First, we are pleased to this quarter. Again, it is the third quarter in a row of double-digit, sales growth, we are very pleased about it. Very balanced between U.S. and OUS. Our Ultra RESILIA adoption is going very well according to plan in U.S. and in Japan. And, and we look at the opportunity with, so many patients are undiagnosed and untreated. So we feel good about, what's ahead of us, we feel we are well-positioned. All of the data, presented this week give us even greater confidence. But, Larry, you want to add anything?\nLarry Wood: Yeah. I don't have a lot to add, this is our third straight quarter of double-digit growth, which coming out of COVID and all the rockiness that we saw during that period of time. It's actually been really good to see the stability that we've seen and the continued growth even as our business gets larger. So I actually feel really good about our growth rate. I think, we're continuing to work to get patients off the sidelines and our patient activation. I think the data, hopefully, the data here is reassuring for patients. People were worried about a durability signal with TAVR. And now we have really high quality data published in the New England Journal of Medicine which shows absolutely no durability signal at five years using [indiscernible] definition. So we think all of those are positive and those continue to help us have double-digit and sustainable growth over a long period of time. So I feel great about where we are.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Maybe one more product question here from me. You just kind of EVOQUE approved in Europe with CE Mark. We'll see the data for six months tomorrow in tricuspid replacement. This is a market we hear from doctors a lot, they may not be terribly excited about repair but replacement could be a really exciting option. What do you think Edwards needs to do as a company to take this market and accelerate adoption and drive uptake here in an area that's been pretty slow with tricuspid repair? Thanks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Robbie. So we are going to do, what we have done in TAVR for the last 15 years, basically. Focusing, number one on the patient outcomes. So which is why, we are being -- we are going to be focusing on making sure, our team (ph) is well-trained, well equipped, to support the physicians. We are going to have a disciplined launch in Europe, and we are going to produce evidence like twice in two, cohorts you are going to see tomorrow. And we are going to continue to produce more evidence. But maybe Daveen, you want to add anything here?\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. No. Thanks, Bernard. I appreciate it. No, I think, as Bernard has said, we really do believe that it's the comprehensive high touch model and outstanding outcomes is a key step. But it's much more than that. And us having the ability to take the TAVR playbook from long ago and help apply it to this news area is really important. And for us that includes not only technology, innovation, evidence, but also continuing to then overtime, work on helping improve diagnosis referral and eventually treatment of patients. But for us, this is a comprehensive kind of play, a long-term play for us to really build a new therapy that we're really excited about to help patients with.\nBernard Zovighian: And if I may add, Robbie here. We're also at the beginning of better understanding of this tricuspid -- tricuspid disease, we believe that with TEER and replacement adoption physician will have more options to treat even more patients. So we are going to learn a lot here, about, what therapy for what patient but I think two therapy in Europe. And as you know, leading that space we are going learn a lot in the past sort of few years, and I'm sure, patient will benefit from that.\nRobbie Marcus: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Hey, Scott, year-to-date the TAVR growth is a little over 10% I believe in the midpoint of the guidance it's about 11.5%. So should we be thinking about the low end of the TAVR range of 10% to 13% for the year. And if not, what drives the acceleration implied in Q4 for TAVR? Then I had one follow up.\nScott Ullem: Well, I'd take you back to the beginning of the year when our guidance for the full year for both TAVR and Edwards was 9% to 12%. We increased it to ultimately 10% to 13% because of the first quarter and second quarter results. So we're coming in about where we thought we would for Q3 and Q4. The 10% to 13% guidance reflects the stronger than expected Q1 and Q2. In the fourth quarter, our guidance for the full company is about $10 million higher at the midpoint than our results in Q3. So we haven't broken out guidance by business unit, but you can expect that overall, we expect the fourth quarter that looks pretty similar to the third quarter. You're right, I think for the full year, we're probably going to end up about in the middle of the range that we, that we said 10% to 13%, but that doesn't mean that it's 10% to 13% for Q4 because, again, that higher range reflects the increase from the first quarter.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you for that. And obviously, people are starting to think about '24 right now. So Bernard, at our conference you talked about targeting double digit annual revenue growth. Does that apply to 2024? And Scott you know '23 guidance implies margins are down year-over-year because of investments and currency. What are some of the puts and takes in the P&L you know, that we should be thinking about it. And any help on, on FX would be appreciated? Thank you.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Larry. Let me take you to the first part of your question here. So for, you know, 2024 guidance, you will get all of the details here in December at our investor event. And your question is about my confidence and our confidence as a company. Yes, we are confident as I said during the script, I think like we have an amazing opportunity in front of us with so many patients. All of our businesses are in solid position in global leadership position. So I am confident for the years to come for 2024, more to come in December, Larry.\nScott Ullem: And Larry, it's Scott. For the second part of your question about FX. We'll talk about more of the specifics at the investor conference. But if you take our exchange rate environment right now and apply it to 2024, it would be a headwind to sales, and also a headwind to EPS. So we'll be able to quantify that more specifically. And we'll see what happens to FX rates between now and then as well.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bernard, maybe a first one for you on this TAVR five year data that was presented. A lot of noise in the Street on the lines crossing for Edwards and your peer, the lines widening between TAVR and Control. Does that worry you at all just from Edwards' perspective when you look at the data. And I think you also mentioned [indiscernible] definition for durability. Is that something that your peer also use the same definition or are there some differences here and how durability was defined in these two trials?\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Vijay. Let me start high level, I believe last night, investor event was, very insightful with Dr. Leon and Dr. Mark. They went very deep into the data. They went very deep into the meaning, the meaning of the data and the trial design. At the end of the day, you know, for me, it is I like to keep it very simple. 90% survival at five years. That's amazing for patients that's in my mind, what we should remember, but I'm going to ask Larry to comment and with a greater detail here.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. Thanks, Bernard. Yeah. This whole thing about the curves continuing to diverge, just isn't really accurate. I think we had a little bit of a catch up. But if you notice from the New England Journal Medicine manuscript, we are impacted somewhat by the patients that withdrew on the surgical side disproportionately. And when we did the phone sweep, the absolute difference that we're showing at five years is about 1%. When you go into the causes of death, you look at cardiovascular mortality, they're about the same. We had, I think, double the rate of cancer. We had 3 times as much COVID death in the TAVR group, as we had in the surgical group. And I think higher rates of sepsis, which were all adjudicated to be not TAVR related. And I don't think anybody is suggesting that TAVR causes cancer or COVID. So when you get into the depths of the data, I mean, we feel great about the data. What's amazing about this data set is that both groups performed incredibly well. And given the prominence of Edwards surgical valves, and then obviously our TAVR cohort, we're looking at both groups that have over 90% survival at five years. And the other thing that people have been worried about with TAVR was durability. And you're right, we did use the bark definitions for durability, which remember, isn't what -- with surgery is historically used. Surgery historically is used, freedom from X plant due to structural valve deterioration, not echo derived criteria. And so, part of what drives the New England Journal of Medicine publication is we used all the contemporary standards, all the contemporary things. So, I don't want to comment on other people's data. You can ask them about their data and what methodologies they use. But I'm very comfortable we applied the highest academic standard STAAR study. And again, we feel great about the data. And I think there's just a little bit of an oddity here that, that people are discussing that somehow TAVR has to be better than the surgery. If we have two procedures, TAVR and surgery, and we can go to patients and say, your results are identical at five years. Then that's going to automatically default people to the less invasive therapy. And now, we need to continue to follow these patients. We need to follow them all the way up to 10 years. But for a pretty significant interim look at the data at five years, I don't think we could be any happier about the data than we are.\nBernard Zovighian: And in addition, Vijay, if you think about what we have been seeing all along about the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of this patient. Now you look at this PARTNER 3 five years, we hope -- we certainly hope, that we're referring network of cardiologists will send more patients because they have options, safe options, effective options. So we feel good about all of this\nLarry Wood: Yeah. I mean, I'll just add. I think this was a great day. Great meeting for the field in general. If you have patients on the sidelines, who say I'm just -- I just don't want to have open heart surgery, I'm too scared of open heart surgery. But they're being told, TAVR doesn't really have any data behind it and it's still early. If you look at both datasets that were presented, there is absolutely no durability signal at five years or four years, depending on which study you're looking at. And I think that's to just give the referral community tremendous confidence that they can patients for this procedure and they're going to get a durable outcome.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful guys. And Bernard, just one more for you. There were some headlines on investigation in Europe. Any financial implications here, it's just the headlines looked a little, little odd. And I know it's a silly question but I have to ask. Is there any GLP-1 exposure to TAVR or TAVR patients related to based in GLP-1s. Thank you.\nBernard Zovighian: No, thanks. In Europe, no, there is, no financial exposure. We had a brief statement on that. So no expectation here. With regards to GLP-1 exposure to TAVR, we don't think so. We have not seen any evidence that, losing weight has any impact to aortic stenosis disease. We don't, we don't know that, we don't see that. We don't -- we have not seen any evidence. So we don't see any, any possible implication here. Larry, anything to add?\nLarry Wood: No, I totally agree. I think, as it relates to just general things, obviously people losing weight is a good thing, but we've never seen anything related to even, even coronary disease, but a lot of these things are genetically derived and genetically driven, and I don't think your weight is going to be the determinant of those things. So I don't really see any impact of this.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to just ask first on the tricuspid repair and replacement segment, and just get your views on patient reported outcomes, driving approvals and then potentially reimbursement decisions, positive reimbursement decisions. Are patient reported outcomes or quality of life improvements enough to clear the, those two hurdles?\nBernard Zovighian: So let me start, and then I'm sure, Daveen can add his thoughts. It is a good start. We have seen TRILUMINATE so far, correct? And we believe, TRILUMINATE was a good study, good outcome for patients, safe with great quality of life improvement for its patient, who have a miserable life. We need to remember that. With EVOQUE, we are going to talk about it tomorrow. So it is tough for me to talk about it today. We might talk about it more, at the end of the day tomorrow, at our investor conference. But at the end of the day, quality of life improvements are important. Solid safety profile also is important. And all of that, we see that as a great, start for this patient who have no other options today. Daveen, you want to add anything?\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. I mean I think we continue to see out of our European experience where we do have PASCAL tricuspid approved, that we can, see these great outcomes where the technology is really making a difference in patients' lives. It's taking patients that ultimately can't do the things they want to do in their day to day. They feel really down. They have trouble breathing, and it really just helps them live the life that they want to lead. And so for us to see now in this randomized trial that's been presented with TRILUMINATE, to see high quality data, where that you can treat tricuspid regurgitation in a randomized trial, get safe results and have significant TEER reduction with meaningful quality of life. Wow, I mean that's just fantastic for patients. It's something we love. And ultimately down to the community and the regulators are going to keep looking at the benefit and risk trade-off to make the decisions that they need to make. But we continue to be super excited by what these therapies are doing for tricuspid patients.\nBernard Zovighian: What we -- in addition of what Daveen said, what we like about where we are today is, in the past, few years, it was only about TEER, it was only about repair. So physicians didn't have a lot of options. And what we are doing is now progressing with our vision to being able to offer to physician a toolbox. So they can decide, what therapy for what patient, for what anatomy. And so that's still a big progress to where we were in a few years ago, even in a few months ago. So a great progress here, and I see more to come.\nJoshua Jennings: No. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up on just the U.S. sales strategy and having two separate teams for TAVR and for the TMTT franchise. Just wanted to hear about how that's going. And I guess the concern is just are you missing any cross-selling synergies that you could potentially garner from the TAVR sales reps and their deep relationships with some of these interventional cardiologists? Thanks for taking the question.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you. So what about, I ask Larry, who's leading that to every day to comment on this.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. It\u2019s funny when we launched TAVR in the U.S., if you remember, half of our procedures were transapical. And people were like, hey, you already have a selling organization that's selling to surgeons, why are you developing this whole new sales organization, you can get a lot of synergy. But it's really all about providing that high-touch model and that level of expertise, and we built out a completely separate sales force for THV, and I don't think there's a day we looked back on that and think that, that was a bad decision. I think we feel that, that was the right decision for the therapy. Mitral patients are different than aortic patients. And, if you ask your clinical specialists and your salespeople to try to be experts in 10 therapies, they're going to be generalists and all of them not experts. And I think one of the reasons we've had the success we've had in TAVR is, when, I think our average field clinical specialist supports about 1,200 cases a year. And so you bring that level of expertise to every case and we really drive differentiated outcomes for patients, which I think what's driven the therapy and what's driven our leadership. And we like that model a lot. We think it's been hugely successful. Just because our teams sit in different organizations doesn't mean they don't talk. And Daveen and I talk a lot. I have surgical structural heart now, but I talked to Wayne, our General Manager of that, all the time. We look for where there are opportunities for us to work together. But at the same time, we want to make sure we have focus on these new therapies, and we bring the highest level of expertise possible so we drive the best outcomes for patients possible because we believe that is what's going to drive long-term, the success of our franchises.\nDaveen Chopra: I'll add one thing on that. This is Daveen. Even here at TCT, as I talk to physicians, the one thing I consistently hear from physicians is, they so appreciate our comprehensive high-touch model. They love that they're Edwards person who is so deep in the mitral tricuspid space, and that's all they breathe, live and really think about. And so they can offer the best possible advice to the physician, the best possible collaboration to ensure the best possible patient result. And I just love seeing that this week as I talk to physicians.\nJoshua Jennings: That's helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nTravis Steed: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to clarify one clarification, when I add your Q4 guide of $0.60 to $0.66, I'm getting to a full year of $2.47 to $2.53, which is different than your full year guidance. So I don't know if there was a restatement or just wondering maybe my math is off, just wanted to clarify that if you don't mind.\nScott Ullem: So your math is spot-on at the midpoint of the range that's exactly what it implies. And so, take the midpoint, it ends up at the lower end of that $2.50 to $2.60 range, but still within the range.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Got it. And then, the comment on U.S. and OUS growth rates being comparable. Is that referring to constant currency reported? It looks like OUS is a little bit lighter this quarter, and just wanted to make sure I understood everything going on OUS and some of the Japan comments and what's going on in Japan.\nScott Ullem: All the growth rates we've talked about were underlying constant currency growth rates.\nTravis Steed: Okay. That's fair. And then my last question was on 2024 I know you're not going to talk a lot about 2024, but curious if you think you can still hold share stable with new competition coming in or if you think it's fair to assume, something less than the market growth rates in, in 2024.\nScott Ullem: Yeah. It's Scott, let's hold-off on that question about share and the environment, new product introductions and all kind of stuff. There's a lot that we expect to happen in 2024. And we'll look forward to getting into all of those details and forecasts when we get together at our investor conference in December.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Two of them. I know you don't want to talk about 2024, but last year, you did a great job of with helping to understand the impact of FX on gross margins. And it sounds like you're going to have that FX headwind next year. Can you sort of level set us for how to think about gross margins next year?\nScott Ullem: Yeah, I hate to do this to you, Joanne. But again, we're going to have to hold off until we get to December. Really, all we can say right now is that, we think we're going to see some pressure on the top line reported sales dollars won't impact our underlying growth rates. And the reported sales dollars headwind is going to flow right down to earnings per share. Now again, that's not current foreign exchange rate. So when we get to December and we lay out our full year guidance for 2024, and we'll go through all the lines of the P&L and take you through all the details. But at this point we really can't tell you more.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. My follow-up question, which is completely unrelated, if you did have another quarter of double-digit surgical valve revenue. And I'm curious what's helping to drive that and how much of it is maybe an upcharge from RESILIA versus underlying demand? Thank you.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So let me start here, so 11% obviously, we are very pleased, I don't know if you remember, but a few years ago, nobody believed in surgical and we believe in surgical because we have been a pioneer here. We have been a great innovator and our innovation is paying off. What we see in Q3 again, like in 2023, we see a balanced combination between adoption of our RESILIA platform, premium pricing, and also the procedural growth. So altogether, but it is very balanced between procedure growth and our premium technology.\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah, I'll just add. It's, we'll try to bring this to life a little bit at the investor conference is, I almost feel like when we have a good surgical quarter that you guys get mad at us because you think it comes at the expense of TAVR. And I'll tell you as the guy that runs both those business units, that gets really frustrating after a while, and my new GM is really mad about it. So as -- but what you have to understand is our surgical business isn't 100% aortic stenosis. Our surgical business treats aortic, we treat mitral. And even in the aortic space, we don't just treat aortic stenosis, we treat aortic regurgitation. We have products like KONECT, where we're treating aortic aneurysm disease. We have repair products, replacement products. So there's just a lot more that goes into that business than aortic stenosis. So thinking that the zero sum game between the two businesses just isn't the right way to think about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. So one, if I could on -- sometimes Scott and Bernard, you're able to offer some color as to what, how the different types of centers in the U.S. have been performing. You mentioned staffing stable. Any color as to, which large, small or size centers were additive to growth in what ways? And then I have one follow up.\nBernard Zovighian: Yeah, maybe, I'm going to ask Larry to comment on that with.\nLarry Wood: Yeah. We look at this every quarter, and I will just tell you just even internally amongst us. We sort of see the growth rates by segment, and then we sort of make up the reasons for why we think they're different a little bit. I will tell you, during COVID, we saw trends that said when COVID spiked, people tended to stay a little bit closer to home, and we saw maybe some of our smaller centers grow more and, and larger centers would grow less. And then as COVID wane we'd, we'd see larger centers kind of return to higher growth. I think this quarter, we probably saw a little bit more growth in the higher -- in the bigger centers than the smaller centers. But really, I think it's getting a little bit negligible over kind of returning to a little bit of a sense of normalcy as it relates to growth across center size.\nMatt Miksic: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then, and then just one follow-up on just maybe a segment of the market that's, like, got to be getting bigger, I guess at this point. But looking forward being the only valve on the market with a valve-in-valve indication. How big is that now and how important is that? We talk a little bit about the expanding indications into, not asymptomatic and moderate AS patients over the intermediate long-term. But, does valve-in-valve become a factor that you can talk more about or maybe help us understand how that factors into your growth or the general growth in the market at this point?\nLarry Wood: Yeah. I think -- it's a good question. I think valve-in-valve isn't, isn't a huge part of our offering right now. It's not a big driver for us. We do TAVR and SAVR, so TAVR in failed bioprological surgical valves. And as TAVR came online, we saw more and more biological valve usage in younger patients because they knew they would have this TAVR option down the road. So we think that, that's going to be, as these patients live longer, obviously, our surgical valves are very durable, but that was a whole basis for INSPIRIS, was creating a valve that would be a great platform for their TAVR procedure down the road, and that's the whole basis for it, and we think that will pay dividends later. As we just got the low risk approval, it's still fairly new for us. It's not something that's been around for, forever. But the more and more patients that are younger that are getting TAVR, eventually, those patients will come back and need a second procedure. And so for us, having a tab and tab option, it just feeds directly into our lifetime management strategy, which is putting in a first valve and ensuring that you have a strategy for that next intervention. And that's true, whether it's in INSPIRIS as your first valve or whether it's a SAPIEN 3 as your first valve, we want to make sure we have an option for that patient when they come back. And that's what's great about both of our surgical and TAVR platforms is they're both really a great host for that future valves. And we do think, as you advance down the road, the tab and tab will become a bigger contributor to our growth over time.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey. Good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if I could follow-up actually on the data, the five year data, we saw yesterday. And Larry, if there's any read that we can make or something that could -- that we saw in the data that could give us more confidence in the upcoming asymptomatic data readout or is that just too difficult to take anything from yesterday and apply it to that trial?\nLarry Wood: Yeah. I appreciate everybody's trying to get an early read on early TAVR. And I don't think there's -- I don't think there's anything that's really --from this data that I \u2013 and I haven't even, we haven't even broke apart the early TAVR data. So I don't even know anything about the data set yet to even talk about and even if I did, I couldn't tell you. I think the, just broadly speaking, the fact that we show excellent durability out at five years with no durability signal whatsoever. SVA asymptomatic trial was successful, which you know, we obviously hope it is. But if that trial is successful, it just takes one more burden away from people saying, do I want to treat people earlier in the disease state. And I think the more durability data we can put on the board will help make that if that trial was successful and we do get the indication that, that will be one barrier that's removed. So I think the long-term data continuing to build on the durability and safety and long-term results of the platform, just continue to be important, and it's going to be important long-term for the progress trial. If you're going to treat people with moderate disease down the road, you need to make sure you have a durable platform and that it has options, down the road for these patients. So I think it all is complementary, but I don't think anything about this trial informs the early TAVR results.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. Got it. And then just a quick question on. Bernard, you mentioned there's still a lot of these patients untreated out there. I mean, as far as Edwards' progress on getting those patients off the couch into their physician's office diagnosed and referred for TAVR. I mean, where are we in that process? You guys spent a lot of time at the Analyst Day last December, I imagine we'll get an update too in December, in a few week here. But just curious what you can say about, are you seeing any real traction in some of the direct-to-consumer campaigns, things like that. Thanks so much.\nBernard Zovighian: Well, thanks for the question. We see that this initiative as super and important to us. We have a right platform. We have a right science so how can we get you know more patients. And we have done in the last, I want to say years, maybe you know three to four years, a lot of initiatives, a lot of pilots, we learned a lot. This year, we scale some of the initiatives. And so we are going to talk more about it in December. Larry and his team are going to talk about it. But we feel like -- we have some interesting learning, and we believe that, we are starting to see some impact also. So we feel excited about the potential of that. It is why, when we see, we believe the future is even more exciting. It is because of this reason. In addition, obviously, asymptomatic and moderate indication will add to all of this. But Larry, do you want to add anything?\nLarry Wood: Sure. I think it's one thing that I think people are missing a little bit is, it's not like we just started doing patient activation stuff last year or in the last two years. I mean we go all the way back to starting a website with a lot of educational information for patients, even things like how to find a TAVR center and questionnaires and patient information kits. So we've been doing a lot of things over the last several years, and I think, is one of the reasons the market has grown and developed the way it has. So I think a lot of our digital and patient activation efforts are still -- are paying dividends right now. Now, the deeper you go into the prevalence pool, the harder it gets and the more activation you have to do. So it's sort of a -- it's not a light switch. It's a never-ending journey that you're going to do to continue to build on the last program with additional programs to try to get people activated. And I'll tell you, we have a lot of work streams, and we're looking forward to maybe get into a little bit more detail at the investor conference and trying to show you a little bit about other things that we're working on. But we have a number of pilots and we have a lot of very mature programs at the same time that we think help us a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nPito Chickering: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Pre-script you mentioned that the TAVR market share is stable. If you look at competitive accounts with hospitals or doctors, that use both SAPIEN and CoreValve? Are you seeing any market changes in those accounts where RESILIA is competing against FX?\nDaveen Chopra: Yeah. I think market share has been pretty stable. I don't think we've seen big shifts or big changes. We're very excited about RESILIA and I think, I think it does get people increased confidence in, going into younger lower risk patients. So, we feel good about that, but maybe we can try to update that a little bit more at the investor conference, but again, I think overall, I think share has been, been generally pretty stable.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Great. And then a quick follow up for TAVR, I think you said procedure growth was the same as revenue growth. But was there any benefit from positive pricing from RESILIA, I thought that would help to drive revenue growth above the volume growth? Thanks so much.\nDaveen Chopra: There was a little benefit, it wasn't the, the big driver of our growth.\nPito Chickering: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the-time we have for questions today. I'll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you. So let me close this meeting by saying, I am pleased with our performance in 2023. Beyond the numbers, I am excited with the progress we have made, reinforcing our TAVR leadership position with new clinical evidence, and expanding our mitral and tricuspid patient reach with new approved technologies. As a result, we are confident in our long-term strategy to help even more patients around the world. Thanks for your continued trust in Edwards. The IR team, Scott and I welcome any additional questions, any additional questions by phone. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that we conclude today's conference call. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Yeah. I don't have a lot to add, this is our third straight quarter of double-digit growth, which coming out of COVID and all the rockiness that we saw during that period of time. It's actually been really good to see the stability that we've seen and the continued growth even as our business gets larger. So I actually feel really good about our growth rate. I think, we're continuing to work to get patients off the sidelines and our patient activation. I think the data, hopefully, the data here is reassuring for patients. People were worried about a durability signal with TAVR. And now we have really high quality data published in the New England Journal of Medicine which shows absolutely no durability signal at five years using [indiscernible] definition. So we think all of those are positive and those continue to help us have double-digit and sustainable growth over a long period of time. So I feel great about where we are. Yeah. Thanks, Bernard. Yeah. This whole thing about the curves continuing to diverge, just isn't really accurate. I think we had a little bit of a catch up. But if you notice from the New England Journal Medicine manuscript, we are impacted somewhat by the patients that withdrew on the surgical side disproportionately. And when we did the phone sweep, the absolute difference that we're showing at five years is about 1%. When you go into the causes of death, you look at cardiovascular mortality, they're about the same. We had, I think, double the rate of cancer. We had 3 times as much COVID death in the TAVR group, as we had in the surgical group. And I think higher rates of sepsis, which were all adjudicated to be not TAVR related. And I don't think anybody is suggesting that TAVR causes cancer or COVID. So when you get into the depths of the data, I mean, we feel great about the data. What's amazing about this data set is that both groups performed incredibly well. And given the prominence of Edwards surgical valves, and then obviously our TAVR cohort, we're looking at both groups that have over 90% survival at five years. And the other thing that people have been worried about with TAVR was durability. And you're right, we did use the bark definitions for durability, which remember, isn't what -- with surgery is historically used. Surgery historically is used, freedom from X plant due to structural valve deterioration, not echo derived criteria. And so, part of what drives the New England Journal of Medicine publication is we used all the contemporary standards, all the contemporary things. So, I don't want to comment on other people's data. You can ask them about their data and what methodologies they use. But I'm very comfortable we applied the highest academic standard STAAR study. And again, we feel great about the data. And I think there's just a little bit of an oddity here that, that people are discussing that somehow TAVR has to be better than the surgery. If we have two procedures, TAVR and surgery, and we can go to patients and say, your results are identical at five years. Then that's going to automatically default people to the less invasive therapy. And now, we need to continue to follow these patients. We need to follow them all the way up to 10 years. But for a pretty significant interim look at the data at five years, I don't think we could be any happier about the data than we are. Yeah. I mean, I'll just add. I think this was a great day. Great meeting for the field in general. If you have patients on the sidelines, who say I'm just -- I just don't want to have open heart surgery, I'm too scared of open heart surgery. But they're being told, TAVR doesn't really have any data behind it and it's still early. If you look at both datasets that were presented, there is absolutely no durability signal at five years or four years, depending on which study you're looking at. And I think that's to just give the referral community tremendous confidence that they can patients for this procedure and they're going to get a durable outcome. No, I totally agree. I think, as it relates to just general things, obviously people losing weight is a good thing, but we've never seen anything related to even, even coronary disease, but a lot of these things are genetically derived and genetically driven, and I don't think your weight is going to be the determinant of those things. So I don't really see any impact of this. Yeah. It's funny when we launched TAVR in the U.S., if you remember, half of our procedures were transapical. And people were like, hey, you already have a selling organization that's selling to surgeons, why are you developing this whole new sales organization, you can get a lot of synergy. But it's really all about providing that high-touch model and that level of expertise, and we built out a completely separate sales force for THV, and I don't think there's a day we looked back on that and think that, that was a bad decision. I think we feel that, that was the right decision for the therapy. Mitral patients are different than aortic patients. And, if you ask your clinical specialists and your salespeople to try to be experts in 10 therapies, they're going to be generalists and all of them not experts. And I think one of the reasons we've had the success we've had in TAVR is, when, I think our average field clinical specialist supports about 1,200 cases a year. And so you bring that level of expertise to every case and we really drive differentiated outcomes for patients, which I think what's driven the therapy and what's driven our leadership. And we like that model a lot. We think it's been hugely successful. Just because our teams sit in different organizations doesn't mean they don't talk. And Daveen and I talk a lot. I have surgical structural heart now, but I talked to Wayne, our General Manager of that, all the time. We look for where there are opportunities for us to work together. But at the same time, we want to make sure we have focus on these new therapies, and we bring the highest level of expertise possible so we drive the best outcomes for patients possible because we believe that is what's going to drive long-term, the success of our franchises. Yeah. We look at this every quarter, and I will just tell you just even internally amongst us. We sort of see the growth rates by segment, and then we sort of make up the reasons for why we think they're different a little bit. I will tell you, during COVID, we saw trends that said when COVID spiked, people tended to stay a little bit closer to home, and we saw maybe some of our smaller centers grow more and, and larger centers would grow less. And then as COVID wane we'd, we'd see larger centers kind of return to higher growth. I think this quarter, we probably saw a little bit more growth in the higher -- in the bigger centers than the smaller centers. But really, I think it's getting a little bit negligible over kind of returning to a little bit of a sense of normalcy as it relates to growth across center size. Yeah. I think -- it's a good question. I think valve-in-valve isn't, isn't a huge part of our offering right now. It's not a big driver for us. We do TAVR and SAVR, so TAVR in failed bioprological surgical valves. And as TAVR came online, we saw more and more biological valve usage in younger patients because they knew they would have this TAVR option down the road. So we think that, that's going to be, as these patients live longer, obviously, our surgical valves are very durable, but that was a whole basis for INSPIRIS, was creating a valve that would be a great platform for their TAVR procedure down the road, and that's the whole basis for it, and we think that will pay dividends later. As we just got the low risk approval, it's still fairly new for us. It's not something that's been around for, forever. But the more and more patients that are younger that are getting TAVR, eventually, those patients will come back and need a second procedure. And so for us, having a tab and tab option, it just feeds directly into our lifetime management strategy, which is putting in a first valve and ensuring that you have a strategy for that next intervention. And that's true, whether it's in INSPIRIS as your first valve or whether it's a SAPIEN 3 as your first valve, we want to make sure we have an option for that patient when they come back. And that's what's great about both of our surgical and TAVR platforms is they're both really a great host for that future valves. And we do think, as you advance down the road, the tab and tab will become a bigger contributor to our growth over time. Yeah. I appreciate everybody's trying to get an early read on early TAVR. And I don't think there's -- I don't think there's anything that's really --from this data that I \u2013 and I haven't even, we haven't even broke apart the early TAVR data. So I don't even know anything about the data set yet to even talk about and even if I did, I couldn't tell you. I think the, just broadly speaking, the fact that we show excellent durability out at five years with no durability signal whatsoever. SVA asymptomatic trial was successful, which you know, we obviously hope it is. But if that trial is successful, it just takes one more burden away from people saying, do I want to treat people earlier in the disease state. And I think the more durability data we can put on the board will help make that if that trial was successful and we do get the indication that, that will be one barrier that's removed. So I think the long-term data continuing to build on the durability and safety and long-term results of the platform, just continue to be important, and it's going to be important long-term for the progress trial. If you're going to treat people with moderate disease down the road, you need to make sure you have a durable platform and that it has options, down the road for these patients. So I think it all is complementary, but I don't think anything about this trial informs the early TAVR results. Sure. I think it's one thing that I think people are missing a little bit is, it's not like we just started doing patient activation stuff last year or in the last two years. I mean we go all the way back to starting a website with a lot of educational information for patients, even things like how to find a TAVR center and questionnaires and patient information kits. So we've been doing a lot of things over the last several years, and I think, is one of the reasons the market has grown and developed the way it has.

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Hey. Thanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased to report third quarter sales performance in line with our expectations, with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.48 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 benefited from a change in U.S. tax regulations. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for this and other items is included with today's release. I'll now cover some additional details of our third quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more balanced hospital staffing environment, as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year end. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based by country. In Japan improved growth in the third quarter was driven by the ongoing launch of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. For global TAVR sales, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion, representing 10% to 13% growth. TMTT growth in Q3 was driven by adoption of our differentiated PASCAL precision platform, activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe and strong procedure volumes. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress towards establishing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with temporary clinical data, in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We continue to expect full year 2023 TMTT sales of $180 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, 11% sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards RESILIA products, based on positive year-to-date performance, we continue to expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion, implying low double-digit growth in 2023. And in critical care, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based upon the performance we have delivered year-to-date, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and full year sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Lastly, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting fourth quarter sales to be between $1.45 billion and $1.53 billion. We are also projecting fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.60 and $0.66. Now, I'll cover additional details of our P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% as expected, compared to 81% in the same period last year. This year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Remember last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by an unusually positive impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $440 million or 29.7% of sales compared to $377 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field based personnel in support of our growth strategy and performance based compensation. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30%, as we invest in field based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the third quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies, and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.7% or 18.8%, excluding the impact of special items. Our reported rate benefited from the suspension of certain U.S. tax regulations, surrounding forward tax credits are slightly higher than expected non-GAAP rate, resulted primarily from income mix and a lower excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 13% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 140 basis points or $16 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $40 million year-over-year negative impact to full year 2023 sales, compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 410 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had a $0.01 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $356 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $411 million, less capital spending of $55 million. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. And before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, as of September 30. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares under our 10b5 plan. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $500 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back over to you, Bernard. Well, I'd take you back to the beginning of the year when our guidance for the full year for both TAVR and Edwards was 9% to 12%. We increased it to ultimately 10% to 13% because of the first quarter and second quarter results. So we're coming in about where we thought we would for Q3 and Q4. The 10% to 13% guidance reflects the stronger than expected Q1 and Q2. In the fourth quarter, our guidance for the full company is about $10 million higher at the midpoint than our results in Q3. So we haven't broken out guidance by business unit, but you can expect that overall, we expect the fourth quarter that looks pretty similar to the third quarter. You're right, I think for the full year, we're probably going to end up about in the middle of the range that we, that we said 10% to 13%, but that doesn't mean that it's 10% to 13% for Q4 because, again, that higher range reflects the increase from the first quarter. And Larry, it's Scott. For the second part of your question about FX. We'll talk about more of the specifics at the investor conference. But if you take our exchange rate environment right now and apply it to 2024, it would be a headwind to sales, and also a headwind to EPS. So we'll be able to quantify that more specifically. And we'll see what happens to FX rates between now and then as well. So your math is spot-on at the midpoint of the range that's exactly what it implies. And so, take the midpoint, it ends up at the lower end of that $2.50 to $2.60 range, but still within the range. All the growth rates we've talked about were underlying constant currency growth rates. Yeah. It's Scott, let's hold-off on that question about share and the environment, new product introductions and all kind of stuff. There's a lot that we expect to happen in 2024. And we'll look forward to getting into all of those details and forecasts when we get together at our investor conference in December. Yeah, I hate to do this to you, Joanne. But again, we're going to have to hold off until we get to December. Really, all we can say right now is that, we think we're going to see some pressure on the top line reported sales dollars won't impact our underlying growth rates. And the reported sales dollars headwind is going to flow right down to earnings per share. Now again, that's not current foreign exchange rate. So when we get to December and we lay out our full year guidance for 2024, and we'll go through all the lines of the P&L and take you through all the details. But at this point we really can't tell you more."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yeah. No. Thanks, Bernard. I appreciate it. No, I think, as Bernard has said, we really do believe that it's the comprehensive high touch model and outstanding outcomes is a key step. But it's much more than that. And us having the ability to take the TAVR playbook from long ago and help apply it to this news area is really important. And for us that includes not only technology, innovation, evidence, but also continuing to then overtime, work on helping improve diagnosis referral and eventually treatment of patients. But for us, this is a comprehensive kind of play, a long-term play for us to really build a new therapy that we're really excited about to help patients with. Yeah. I mean I think we continue to see out of our European experience where we do have PASCAL tricuspid approved, that we can, see these great outcomes where the technology is really making a difference in patients' lives. It's taking patients that ultimately can't do the things they want to do in their day to day. They feel really down. They have trouble breathing, and it really just helps them live the life that they want to lead. And so for us to see now in this randomized trial that's been presented with TRILUMINATE, to see high quality data, where that you can treat tricuspid regurgitation in a randomized trial, get safe results and have significant TEER reduction with meaningful quality of life. Wow, I mean that's just fantastic for patients. It's something we love. And ultimately down to the community and the regulators are going to keep looking at the benefit and risk trade-off to make the decisions that they need to make. But we continue to be super excited by what these therapies are doing for tricuspid patients. I'll add one thing on that. This is Daveen. Even here at TCT, as I talk to physicians, the one thing I consistently hear from physicians is, they so appreciate our comprehensive high-touch model. They love that they're Edwards person who is so deep in the mitral tricuspid space, and that's all they breathe, live and really think about. And so they can offer the best possible advice to the physician, the best possible collaboration to ensure the best possible patient result. And I just love seeing that this week as I talk to physicians. Yeah, I'll just add. It's, we'll try to bring this to life a little bit at the investor conference is, I almost feel like when we have a good surgical quarter that you guys get mad at us because you think it comes at the expense of TAVR. And I'll tell you as the guy that runs both those business units, that gets really frustrating after a while, and my new GM is really mad about it. So as -- but what you have to understand is our surgical business isn't 100% aortic stenosis. Our surgical business treats aortic, we treat mitral. And even in the aortic space, we don't just treat aortic stenosis, we treat aortic regurgitation. We have products like KONECT, where we're treating aortic aneurysm disease. We have repair products, replacement products. So there's just a lot more that goes into that business than aortic stenosis. So thinking that the zero sum game between the two businesses just isn't the right way to think about it. Yeah. I think market share has been pretty stable. I don't think we've seen big shifts or big changes. We're very excited about RESILIA and I think, I think it does get people increased confidence in, going into younger lower risk patients. So, we feel good about that, but maybe we can try to update that a little bit more at the investor conference, but again, I think overall, I think share has been, been generally pretty stable. There was a little benefit, it wasn't the, the big driver of our growth."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, we are hosting today's call from TCT in San Francisco. I'm going to start by covering some of the exciting developments at the conference, share highlights of the significant progress our team has made advancing our strategy, review our strong third quarter results, and finally, discuss our confidence in the outlook for Edwards. We have a lot of data being presented this week about technologies, Edwards has developed. Included among these are results from free late-breaking clinical trials, all of which reflects Edwards' commitment to generating high quality evidence, to advance innovative therapies for patients, suffering from structural heart disease. Yesterday, physicians presented five year data from the PARTNER 3 low risk pivotal trial. We believe these data demonstrate that TAVR with the SAPIEN platform should continue to be the preferred therapy for treating patients, who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Still more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experiences and trials, now eight New England Journal of Medicine Publication and over a million patients treated, SAPIEN technology offers patient unique benefits. SAPIEN 3 has demonstrated 99% freedom from death and disabling stroke at one year. 90% survival at five years and is the only valve with the THV and THV indication. This is true lifetime management benefit, which expands option for patients. Tomorrow at TCT, we are looking forward to the presentation of the six month analysis of our EVOQUE tricuspid valve, the first-of-its-kind of therapy for the millions of patients, suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In addition, tomorrow, you will receive a one year full cohort result of a CLASP IID pivotal trial with PASCAL. We continue to make meaningful progress to advance our vision of offering a portfolio of innovative transcatheter therapies to treat tricuspid and mitral valve disease. In the last several weeks, we achieved four important milestones in support of our commitment to patient-focused innovation. First, CE Mark approval for EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system. Second, CE Mark approval for the MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve. Third, PASCAL Precision approval in Japan. Finally, the competition of the enrollment in the first-ever pivotal trial for any transfemoral mitral replacement therapy the ENCIRCLE trial for SAPIEN M3. Turning now to Q3 financial performance. Third quarter global sales grew 11% to $1.5 billion, led by our differentiated portfolio of innovative therapies. We were pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectation and/or present another quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the full year, we continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Now, I will provide an overview of the third quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with third quarter sales of $961 million, up 10% year-over-year. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable. Our U.S. and OUS competitive positions were stable and globally, local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our third quarter TAVR sales were driven by the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. On the clinical side, we are pleased with the pace of enrollment in our pivotal trial alliance, designed to study SAPIEN X4, our groundbreaking next generation TAVR technology. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We look forward to additional data, supporting the Edwards' benchmark program to be presented at the PCR London Valve's Conference in November. Our sales in Japan grew year-over-year, reflecting a gradual recovery in market growth and strong adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. Competitive trialing in the third quarter were -- was less pronounced versus the first half of this year. And as expected, we grew faster than overall procedure growth. Around the world, we remain focused on improving diagnosis and treatment of the many more patients who remain undertreated. In summary, the combination of our global TAVR leadership, along with the data presented at TCT this week, gives the company further confidence in the future of TAVR, and the company's expectation of a $10 billion opportunity by 2028. Now, turning to TMTT. Our commitment to the unmet needs of mitral and tricuspid patients, took a significant step forward with the achievement of several important milestones in this past quarter. TMTT third quarter global sales of $52 million increased 65% versus the prior year. This performance was driven by accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL precision platform, the activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe, as well as key TEER (ph) procedural growth. We continue to be pleased with our excellent clinical outcomes, reflecting the impressive performance of PASCAL Precision and the value brought by our comprehensive high touch model. We are continuing the expansion of PASCAL Precision globally, with the expected launch in Japan before the end of the year. In our mitral clinical trials, we look forward to the one year CLASP IID randomized pivotal trial, and CLASP IID registry outcomes with PASCAL to be presented as part of a late breaking scientific sessions tomorrow at TCT. This will add to the body of evidence, supporting TEER (ph) as an effective therapy for patients. With the earlier than expected completion of enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3, we believe we are one step closer to offering an important valve replacement option, beyond TEER to serve even more patients, suffering from mitral valve disease. In tricuspid, earlier this month, we received CE Mark approval for EVOQUE. We look forward to bringing this new therapy to Europe through disciplined launch that will focus on ensuring excellent patient outcomes. Now, with this approval physicians in Europe will have access to this groundbreaking option in addition to TEER. As noted, tomorrow at TCT late breaking data from the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement technology will be presented on the first 150 randomized patients, based on EVOQUE's FDA breakthrough pathway designation. This landmark presentation on a novel therapy demonstrate our leadership and commitment to innovation and science, and our focus on helping large population of patients with unmet needs. In summary for TMTT, we are proud of the new therapy introductions, clinical trial achievements and geographic expansion. We have achieved to advance our vision to build a portfolio of therapies to transform lives of mitral and tricuspid patients. In surgical, third quarter sales of $247 million increased 11%, driven by a balanced combination of strong global adoption of Edwards' premium technology and overall procedural growth. We continue to see strong momentum of our RESILIA portfolio globally, which has been widely adopted, because of the excellent durability of its proven tissue technology, supported by the recent seven year aortic data and five year mitral data from our commenced clinical trial. We are confident about the future of this technology, as we expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our momentous clinical study. Finally, we received CE Mark approval for our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve earlier this month. We expect to introduce this valve in the fourth quarter, followed by full European launch in 2024. In Critical Care, third quarter sales of $221 million increased 6%, driven by a smart recovery portfolio, with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensors, equipped with the high potential prediction index algorithm. We remain confident in our pipeline of critical care innovation, as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies, designed to help clinicians make better decision and get patient home to their family faster. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. In closing, after more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience over 1 million patients treated. In this week, five year PARTNER III results. Edwards TAVR is positioned for strong sustainable growth, as many patient remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, we have two strong global businesses, critical care and surgical, which our position for durable long-term growth driven by portfolios of differentiated technology. Moreover, we are achieving many, many significant milestones in TMTT, that gives us the confidence about progressing our vision to treat the many mitral and tricuspid patients in need. Altogether, we are convinced of the tremendous opportunity to drive success in the future through our patient focused, breakthrough technologies and leadership. With that, pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A. Thank you, Robbie. Let me start and then I will ask, Larry, to continue here. First, we are pleased to this quarter. Again, it is the third quarter in a row of double-digit, sales growth, we are very pleased about it. Very balanced between U.S. and OUS. Our Ultra RESILIA adoption is going very well according to plan in U.S. and in Japan. And, and we look at the opportunity with, so many patients are undiagnosed and untreated. So we feel good about, what's ahead of us, we feel we are well-positioned. All of the data, presented this week give us even greater confidence. But, Larry, you want to add anything? Thank you, Robbie. So we are going to do, what we have done in TAVR for the last 15 years, basically. Focusing, number one on the patient outcomes. So which is why, we are being -- we are going to be focusing on making sure, our team (ph) is well-trained, well equipped, to support the physicians. We are going to have a disciplined launch in Europe, and we are going to produce evidence like twice in two, cohorts you are going to see tomorrow. And we are going to continue to produce more evidence. But maybe Daveen, you want to add anything here? And if I may add, Robbie here. We're also at the beginning of better understanding of this tricuspid -- tricuspid disease, we believe that with TEER and replacement adoption physician will have more options to treat even more patients. So we are going to learn a lot here, about, what therapy for what patient but I think two therapy in Europe. And as you know, leading that space we are going learn a lot in the past sort of few years, and I'm sure, patient will benefit from that. Thank you, Larry. Let me take you to the first part of your question here. So for, you know, 2024 guidance, you will get all of the details here in December at our investor event. And your question is about my confidence and our confidence as a company. Yes, we are confident as I said during the script, I think like we have an amazing opportunity in front of us with so many patients. All of our businesses are in solid position in global leadership position. So I am confident for the years to come for 2024, more to come in December, Larry. Thank you, Vijay. Let me start high level, I believe last night, investor event was, very insightful with Dr. Leon and Dr. Mark. They went very deep into the data. They went very deep into the meaning, the meaning of the data and the trial design. At the end of the day, you know, for me, it is I like to keep it very simple. 90% survival at five years. That's amazing for patients that's in my mind, what we should remember, but I'm going to ask Larry to comment and with a greater detail here. And in addition, Vijay, if you think about what we have been seeing all along about the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of this patient. Now you look at this PARTNER 3 five years, we hope -- we certainly hope, that we're referring network of cardiologists will send more patients because they have options, safe options, effective options. So we feel good about all of this No, thanks. In Europe, no, there is, no financial exposure. We had a brief statement on that. So no expectation here. With regards to GLP-1 exposure to TAVR, we don't think so. We have not seen any evidence that, losing weight has any impact to aortic stenosis disease. We don't, we don't know that, we don't see that. We don't -- we have not seen any evidence. So we don't see any, any possible implication here. Larry, anything to add? So let me start, and then I'm sure, Daveen can add his thoughts. It is a good start. We have seen TRILUMINATE so far, correct? And we believe, TRILUMINATE was a good study, good outcome for patients, safe with great quality of life improvement for its patient, who have a miserable life. We need to remember that. With EVOQUE, we are going to talk about it tomorrow. So it is tough for me to talk about it today. We might talk about it more, at the end of the day tomorrow, at our investor conference. But at the end of the day, quality of life improvements are important. Solid safety profile also is important. And all of that, we see that as a great, start for this patient who have no other options today. Daveen, you want to add anything? What we -- in addition of what Daveen said, what we like about where we are today is, in the past, few years, it was only about TEER, it was only about repair. So physicians didn't have a lot of options. And what we are doing is now progressing with our vision to being able to offer to physician a toolbox. So they can decide, what therapy for what patient, for what anatomy. And so that's still a big progress to where we were in a few years ago, even in a few months ago. So a great progress here, and I see more to come. Thank you. So what about, I ask Larry, who's leading that to every day to comment on this. Yes. So let me start here, so 11% obviously, we are very pleased, I don't know if you remember, but a few years ago, nobody believed in surgical and we believe in surgical because we have been a pioneer here. We have been a great innovator and our innovation is paying off. What we see in Q3 again, like in 2023, we see a balanced combination between adoption of our RESILIA platform, premium pricing, and also the procedural growth. So altogether, but it is very balanced between procedure growth and our premium technology. Yeah, maybe, I'm going to ask Larry to comment on that with. Well, thanks for the question. We see that this initiative as super and important to us. We have a right platform. We have a right science so how can we get you know more patients. And we have done in the last, I want to say years, maybe you know three to four years, a lot of initiatives, a lot of pilots, we learned a lot. This year, we scale some of the initiatives. And so we are going to talk more about it in December. Larry and his team are going to talk about it. But we feel like -- we have some interesting learning, and we believe that, we are starting to see some impact also. So we feel excited about the potential of that. It is why, when we see, we believe the future is even more exciting. It is because of this reason. In addition, obviously, asymptomatic and moderate indication will add to all of this. But Larry, do you want to add anything? Thank you. So let me close this meeting by saying, I am pleased with our performance in 2023. Beyond the numbers, I am excited with the progress we have made, reinforcing our TAVR leadership position with new clinical evidence, and expanding our mitral and tricuspid patient reach with new approved technologies. As a result, we are confident in our long-term strategy to help even more patients around the world. Thanks for your continued trust in Edwards. The IR team, Scott and I welcome any additional questions, any additional questions by phone. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call is our Chief Executive Officer, Bernard Zovighian, along with our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; and Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of TMTT. Katie Szyman, our Global Leader of Critical Care is out of town today, but she'll be with us on future earnings calls. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2023 financial results. During today's call, Management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that Management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions, and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters, and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K, and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the Company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder, that when using terms constant-currency and adjusted, Management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are available in today's press release. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments. Bernard?\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to share with you the work that our team did to help more patients than even before with our life-saving therapies. Today, I'm going to talk about the strong second quarter performance across product groups, our progress in advancing our patient-focused innovation strategy, and our confidence in the outlook for Edwards in the years ahead. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth, driven by increased adoption of our innovative therapies. Total sales of $1.53 billion grew 12% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than our expectation. We experienced broad-based growth across all of Edwards portfolio. Given improving healthcare staffing and our first half performance, we continue to expect strong results in 2023. As a result, we have lifted our full year 2023 sales and EPS guidance. Longer-term, we are confident in our focused and differentiated strategy given heart valve failure is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We remain committed to increasing our wellness and providing innovative life-saving therapies so even more patients can benefit. Now, I will provide an overview of the second quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with sales of $992 million, up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rate were comparable. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our second quarter TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels, and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We estimate that total procedure growth was in-line with our sales growth. Additionally, we will be restarting enrollment this quarter in our pivotal trial, ALLIANCE, designed to study of next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. Outside of the U.S., we had positive constant currency sales growth from all regions. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth were driven by broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. Our sales in Japan grew sequentially and year-over-year on a constant currency basis, although our results continued to be impacted by lower-than-expected market growth and competitive trialing in the first half of this year. As a result, we estimate overall OUS TAVR procedure growth in Q2 was slightly higher than Edwards' OUS TAVR growth. During the quarter, at the EuroPCR medical congress, data on the Benchmark study were presented on 2,400 patients treated with SAPIEN valves across 28 European centers. It was very encouraging to note that patients experienced a 33% reduction in the median hospital length of stay while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes. This study showed that by implementing best practices with the SAPIEN platform, centers can be more efficient, without compromising patient outcomes. Turning to TMTT. We remain focused on three key value drivers to unlock this opportunity: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcome. TMTT second quarter global sales of $48 million increased nearly 17% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Growth was driven by continued strong overall procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform, and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We continue to hire, train, and grow the field team to deliver on our high-touch model, as we expand. In mitral, enrollment is going -- is ongoing in the Class IIF pivotal trial for functional mitral patients. We are also pleased with the enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for the SAPIEN M3 mitral valve replacement and remain on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year. In tricuspid, the Class IITR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues enrolling well. With the completion of TRISCEND II enrollment, continued access for EVOQUE allows U.S. centers to continue to offer this therapy for tricuspid patients. We remain on track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and U.S. approval around the end of 2024. In Surgical, second quarter sales of $256 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by the adoption of our premium RESILIA products across all regions. Physicians and patients value the feature and benefit of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve procedures. Patient enrollment continued in the second quarter for our MOMENTIS clinical study designed to demonstrate the durability of the RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. We expect that confidence from our -- from the recently presented seven-year data of our upcoming clinical trial will continue to support adoption of our RESILIA family of products. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of, $235 million, increased 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by contributions from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and healthy adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor. Sales momentum for our HemoSphere monitoring platform was also positive in the second quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. Before I turn it over to Scott, I also want to mention our expectation for the upcoming TCT Conference in October. During the conference, we expect several important presentations regarding our transcatheter technologies. In TAVR, we are expecting a presentation of five-year clinical data from the PARTNER 3 low-risk pivotal trial. In TMTT, we anticipate the presentation of a one-year full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial results. Additionally, we anticipate the presentation of the planned interim analysis of the TRISCEND II randomized cohort. I look forward to seeing many of you at the Investor Event we plan to host at TCT. Our Investor Relation team will communicate details as we get closer to the event. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Great. Hi, thanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased with our sales performance in the first half of the year, posting our second consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. All product groups grew double-digits and sales were balanced across regions, with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by the trialing of competitive TAVR products. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.53 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year constant currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Contribution from our better-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by higher performance-based compensation and investments in our transcatheter operations in support of our growth strategy. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 was impacted by the intellectual property agreement I commented on last quarter. We previously had a long-term Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic that expired last year and in consideration for the new agreement, we paid $300 million, approximately half of which has been expensed, and the other half will be amortized over the next 15 years. A reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. I'll now cover some additional details of our second quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more stable hospital staffing environment, as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based by country. We still see some health system capacity challenges, but are encouraged that centers are adapting to continue to treat their patients. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations in Q2, we anticipate that growth rates will improve, driven by the ongoing launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. For global TAVR sales, we are adjusting the low-end of our outlook slightly higher to $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion. We now expect full year TAVR growth to be 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. TMTT growth in the second quarter was driven by strong procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform, and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. Overall, we're pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with contemporary clinical data, in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $180 million to $200 million versus our previous expectation of $170 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, 13% constant currency sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards' premium products as well as strength in valve surgery procedures as hospital staffing levels have continued to improve. Based on positive year-to-date performance, we now expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion versus previous guidance of $870 million to $970 million. This revised range implies low double-digit constant currency growth in 2023. Finally, turning to Critical Care. We continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based on the strong first half of the year, we now forecast full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion versus prior guidance of the high-end of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. We now expect full year total Company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Lastly, we now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting third quarter sales to be between $1.44 billion and $1.52 billion. We are also projecting third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 to $0.61. I'll now cover additional details of our P&L. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.7% as expected, compared to 80.5% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $469 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $409 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by performance-based compensation and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 8% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. During the second quarter, we recorded a $27 million reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.04. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. This reflects an adjustment of assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for a previous acquisition. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 9.7% or 13.1% excluding the impact of special items. Our rate benefited from higher R&D tax credits and a 200 basis point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to 2022. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full year 2023 sales compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $286 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $34 million, less capital spending of $48 million, and excluding a $300 million payment related to the Medtronic Intellectual Property Agreement I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30th. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between 610 million and 615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, I'll hand it back over to you, Bernard.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. So, based on our strong first half result, we have increased confidence that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards and we expect to deliver 10% to 15% sales growth while making meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Longer-term, I have great confidence in our team to further extend our leadership position by bringing our differentiated technologies to patients globally. In closing, we are well positioned for success. With that, I'll pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A.\nMark Wilterding: Thanks a lot, Bernard. With that, we're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one, plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and Management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Operator, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to start, global TAVR growth around 10%, a little weak in Japan. Where do you think we are in the recovery process in terms of stabilizing the system, stabilizing timelines, and staffing in the system? And when do you think we'll get to a new normal in TAVR procedures and diagnosis and treatment?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. Robbie, this is Bernard here. Thank you for the question. We are pleased with our global TAVR result in Q2. 10% constant currency growth, comparable U.S., OUS, basically, and it has been driven by continued strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform. Also, what we have experienced is that improvement in the hospital staffing level in the U.S. and globally, but I'm going to let Larry add some comments here.\nLarry Wood: Hi, Robbie. Yes, it's what - deciding what the new normal is probably a little bit tricky, but I feel like the system has continued to get better. I think when we track staffing, we're not where we should be and we're not where we would have projected to be in absence of the pandemic. But I think patients are certainly coming in and they're getting their visits, and I think when we look at some of the leading indicators, we - diagnosis are up and patients are moving through the system. We still feel constrained somewhat at the Cath Lab level. That's still a place that we still struggle. And I think centers have made tremendous strides, but it's still an adjustment coming out of COVID and we're not back to what I call pre-COVID normal levels. And so, I think we still have a little ways to go. But to consider the - and I think we see that a little bit globally. It varies a lot across Europe and we see it a little bit in Japan, depending on - I think there are still dealing with a little bit more COVID here and there. But I think the encouraging thing is, we're at 10% globally and we know we haven't fully recovered yet. So, I think there's still some opportunity for us to continue to do better and we know the under-treatment remains huge and we still think there's a lot of opportunities to continue to grow this over the long-term.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just kind of a similar question. TMTT, you beat in the quarter. That seems like it was even a bit more imperative over the past few years than the whole TAVR complex. Maybe just talk about mitral and tricuspid, particularly the launch of PASCAL in the U.S., how you think adoption is going versus plan, how you're seeing the competitive situation play out, and just your thoughts in TMTT in general relative to TAVR normalization. Thanks a lot.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So, let me start, Robbie, and then I will ask Daveen to add some comments here. So, we are pleased about Q2, as you see globally. What we are seeing is that the market, the mitral market has done well in Q2, is back to growing and almost a double-digit, something like that. The adoption of PASCAL Precision is going very well. It's going very well in U.S., it's going very well in Europe and we are activating more centers across U.S. and Europe. So, obviously, the way to think about it, we had some great momentum from the market from PASCAL Precision and for us activating more centers. But Daveen, you want to add anything here?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I think as Larry and Bernard talked about, in the market, we continue to see recovery from the staffing portion of it and I think you're right that maybe we got hit a little bit more on the staffing side during COVID. But coming out, we're also still seeing recovery, but I still think there is opportunity to keep getting better on that component. With that being said, with such a large number of - such a large number of patients looking for new therapies, we continue to see relatively a strong market growth. That being said, as we dive into it, we continue to open up new centers in both the U.S. and Europe. Specifically in the U.S., I think we're continuing to hear great feedback from physicians about the differentiated features and benefits of the PASCAL system. We're ramping-up the team. We're opening up new centers each week. We're going through kind of the value-add value analysis committees in the contracting processes with each new center in the U.S. week-in and week-out. And we're really focused, as you can imagine, on the largest accounts in the U.S., not -- who do the most here so far. And so, I'm pretty excited about where we go in the U.S. Maybe just to comment, both on Europe, I think, as Bernard said, we've been again opening up new centers in Europe and I want to make a comment that, tricuspid especially in Europe, continued to see very strong growth. It's a newer therapy, smaller obviously in market size, but continue to see very strong growth, where we're seeing that the market is growing and that people are really seeing that PASCAL actually in this situation, the tricuspid space, is really got these differentiated features for atraumatic and tailored-treatment really for tricuspid tier. So, overall, we continue to be excited about where PASCAL is going in it's lunch.\nScott Ullem: Thank you. And then about the financial implications of everything that Bernard and Daveen just talked about, which is, we're feeling good about how TMTT is developing in 2023. And you saw our original guidance for sales was $160 million to $200 million. We've bumped up the bottom-end of the range by $10 million last quarter. We're bumping at another $10 million this quarter and it's an indication of how positive we feel about our progress this year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just wanted to ask one about the margins basically. So, you had nice gross margins here in Q2. I know you're making a lot of ongoing investments and so, two things I guess. What are kind of the key puts and takes to think about in terms of gross margins and OpEx landing through the second half of the year in terms of phasing or anything discrete to call out? And then just conceptually at a higher level, how should we think about operating margin progression over the course of the next couple of years, especially as you might have some of your bigger clinical study starting to wind down?\nScott Ullem: Yes, thanks for the questions. I'll start with gross margin. Gross margin, we're seeing some benefit of mix in 2023, but it's more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange, that actually hit us last year in 2022 and is flowing through our income statement in 2023. You asked about phasing. It's going to get more impactful negatively in Q3 and Q4, based upon current exchange rates. Now, if exchange rates change, that may change a little bit as well. But we're expecting gross margins to come down a little bit in Q3 and Q4 relative to the first half. All that said, we expect to end up right where we thought we would, in the range of gross margin guidance for 2023, so really nothing changed. In terms of operating expenses, you're right, we've been putting more investment into especially field based personnel in Europe, in U.S., and even outside, and that's weighing on operating expenses, but that's okay. It's part of a deliberate plan to really drive top-line growth by making sure that we've got the right people in the right places, supporting our clinician partners, and making sure that patients are getting the right kind of care, especially as we're introducing these new products in places like TMTT, and what Daveen talked about earlier. As it relates to operating margin progression over the next couple of years, we continue to see opportunities to expand our operating margin and we're looking for ways that we can do that. We've identified areas where we can make changes, and gradually incrementally expand our operating margin. But really it's a secondary focus. The primary focus is investing for long-term top-line growth. We have some clinical trials wind-down over the next couple of years, but we've got other ones spooling up. You know about what trials Larry is running in TAVR, and Daveen has gone in TMTT, and this is a super important area of investment for us, again to drive top-line sales by contributing to this really robust body of clinical evidence that we have supporting the growth in those two transcatheter businesses.\nMatthew Taylor: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bernard, maybe my first one on the TAVR guidance here. I think the underlying was raised at the high-end at 13%. The first half TAVR underlying has been 10% to 11%. I'm curious, why the high-end was raised? Was there something within the quarter that you saw, some phasing or is there something coming in the back half, which gives you the confidence perhaps 13% is even possible?\nBernard Zovighian: Go ahead, you know, Scott.\nScott Ullem: Yes. Vijay, maybe I'll jump in here and give you a sense of how we see it. The change in guidance, the expansion on the top-end of the range, largely reflects better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and the first half results compared to what we originally expected back at the time of the Investor Conference. And so, because we over-achieved in the first half, we are introducing this higher top-end of the range to accommodate a potential faster growth scenario the way we saw earlier in the year. We're still modeling and planning around the midpoint of that 10% to 13% range, but that's the reason why we expanded the top-end.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe one sort of related question here. First half, we've seen TAVR grow mid-teens, how much of that is volume versus price? Why are we still seeing SAVR outgrow TAVR - I think I heard Larry mention the macro-environment staffing is improving. I was just -- and that's - so it's hard for us to see SAVR outgrow TAVR. Is this a fundamental change in the market or perhaps new product introductions that's driving SAVR or some color on SAVR versus TAVR, would be helpful.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So, Vijay, let me start and then I will ask Larry to add his comment here. So, both, our SAVR and TAVR business are growing nicely. And you have SAVR growth has exceeded TAVR because of a combination of things. Market growth, SAVR market growth, but not only, premium pricing of our innovative, price premium technologies, and because of all of that, we saw a better competitive position. So, again in SAVR, what you have is a number of things happening. Wherein TAVR, it is mainly due to positive growth. Maybe Larry you want to add anything here.\nLarry Wood: Yes. I think that's right. We sort of have the three components that help contribute. So you can look at the growth rates and turn it all into procedures because for the TAVR side it is overwhelmingly majority procedures, but it's more of a combination of things, on surgery. I will say, as we move through the COVID recovery though we probably saw hospitals prioritize their surgical programs probably most and I think that deal is a little bit with patient acuity and just the need to get those patients treated, probably a little bit sooner. So I think cath lab recovery has maybe lagged a little bit beyond the surgical recovery. But again, we're very happy with where we saw TAVR procedure growth. this last quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question, two on the pipeline and the TCT updates on this call. Let me start with the TRISCEND II comments, it's big news here. Arguably, EVOQUE is your most important pipeline product, so I guess my question is, Bernard, just a couple here. One, is the trial stopped yet? Second, what would success look like to you, given the TRILUMINATE results showed only a quality-of-life benefit, but no positive trends on hard outcomes? And lastly on TRISCEND II, if positive, I would think approval could come in mid-'24, not late-'24, and I did have one follow-up.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Larry. I see that you are aggressive. That's good. Look, we are - yes, indeed we completed the enrollment of the full cohort of TRISCEND II. I think we have been sharing that already in the past. We need to wait - we need to wait one year follow-up and then putting together all of the data, presenting that to the FDA. So, this is going to take some time, so which is why we still believe that around 2024 approval in the U.S. is reasonable. Are we going to go faster, for sure, but I think end of 2024 is reasonable. Now, I'm sure, your question about how do I - how do we feel about steady results is in light of what we have seen with TRILUMINATE. It is tough to comment because TRILUMINATE was using one technology. TRISCEND II is using a different technology, different devices. We don't know very little about tricuspid disease. So, it's very tough to comment on that, but I have to say that quality-of-life is super important for patients. So, we will - but again, we will have to see what the result of this study and we are confident. Daveen, you want to add anything here?\nDaveen Chopra: Also two small points, thanks for the question. If that - this interim analysis was a part of the statistical plan. So, that's already been planned out and was always a part to kind of show these results. So we're excited to share these results with the clinical community. And I'll make a comment that, for us, I'm actually pretty excited by what we've seen actually previously with TRILUMINATE. It helps really confirm outcomes that have come from other studies with Tier Technologies that we have on PASCAL device, that - that Tier in tricuspid delivers great Trikafta reduction with meaningful quality-of-life improvements and we are excited to see randomized data. So to me, these are all great positive tailwinds in tricuspid and we're excited to see what the TRISCEND II interim planned analysis will show.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. Just for my follow-up, the other one on the PARTNER 3 five-year data, what do you think physicians will be focused on here? There has been some concern among investors and clinicians, given the curves converging between TAVR and SAVR between year one and two in the two-year data. Is there anything you can say that could lay concerns? Thank you.\nLarry Wood: Larry, I can't speak to the - to the data or what's going to be presented. I think what people are going to be looking at is, what the trial was powered for, and what it was designed to do. And we have a composite endpoint of death, or stroke, and rehospitalization and those are the three components. So, I think first and foremost, you look at the primary and then I think people are going to look at the sub-components of that and say what do they see happening in the trends in the trial. And I think, that's what people are going to be looking for. But we're excited that the data is coming forward, and the team is going to continue pulling it in and once it's all adjudicated, the clinicians will obviously take the steering wheel and they'll present the data. But, I think overall every time we have one of these data reports, it just adds to our body of knowledge and adds to the body of evidence and I think that's what we do for the clinical community. So, again, that's - I think primarily we focus on the primary endpoint, just like we did in the trial and we'll see where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nTravis Steed: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on U.S. TAVR growth. I wanted to understand a little bit better. I think you said price was stable, but it sounds like RESILIA has gone past and expected, so I don't there's any way to kind of parse out that U.S., it sounds like 10% TAVR growth in the U.S., how much of that was actually price versus RESILIA in the quarter.\nLarry Wood: Yes, thanks for your question. Yes, the price is a pretty small factor in the U.S. growth number. It's overwhelmingly driven by the procedure growth. When you look at what we're going for RESILIA, for S3 UR. We're still in the - I call it the - I wouldn't call it necessarily the early part, but we haven't even reached halfway in the launch of RESILIA yet. And while we did go for a list price increase of 1,500, if you look at that as a percent of the total device cost, it's a lot smaller than what we did on the surgical side of things. So it's certainly a contributor and it's a long-term contributor for us, but it's pretty small in comparison to the procedure growth. And remember, too, as people's volumes go up, they continue to hit rebate tiers and they get discounted accordingly. So you got to factor all that in as well.\nTravis Steed: Great. That's helpful. And then I did have a follow-up on the raised TAVR guide for the full year. Is there anything you're seeing in July? Just curious like what's giving you the confidence to raise the full year guide? And when you think about Q3, should we think about this being down sequentially versus Q2 in dollars like it has been historically?\nScott Ullem: Yes. It's Scott. A couple of things. The increase in the guide was largely reflective of our stronger-than-expected first half performance and the prospect of potentially overachieving what we had modeled for the second half, although we're still modeling the midpoint of that range that we provided. As far as the July expectation, I guess we'll just leave it as the range that we put out for total company sales in the third quarter incorporates what we see so far month to-date. But we're not going to get into the month-to-month report. In terms of what the later in the year trend may look like, a lot of it depends upon seasonality. We get hit by the summer vacation season and not just in Europe but also in the U.S. And so we'll be able to talk more about that impact when we get to our third quarter call, both for looking back on the third quarter and what the run rate looks like going into Q4.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please state your question.\nJosh Jennings: Just two TAVR questions. One, first, just on the Japan recovery. Can you just talk about or share any insights into [technical difficulty]\nOperator: Excuse me, Josh, you're cutting out. Could you pick up your handset?\nJosh Jennings: Sure. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes, much better. Thank you.\nJosh Jennings: Sorry about that. Just 2 TAVR questions. First one, on the Japan recovery trajectory. Maybe just help us better understand any factors that are limiting the recovery in Japan and how you see that market shaping up in the back half of the year. And then the second question on - just on the PROGRESS trial. Any updates on the enrollment pace, I believe, first patient was enrolled in close to the end of 2021. So we've been about 1.5 years of enrollment and could that trial complete enrollment in 2023 or in 2024? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Josh. So in Japan, what we have seen is a positive, like I said, sequential and also year-over-year growth in the quarter. It was below our expectation, but we believe it is transient for a couple of reasons. One, of the market, as you know, the market is still impacted from COVID and is still recovering from COVID. And also, we believe it is transient, because we are very pleased with the early feedback of the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan. So, we feel like we grew year-over-year sequentially below our expectation, but we are confident that we are going to improve this in Japan. Maybe, Larry, you want to add anything here?\nLarry Wood: Yes, I think that's right. I think Japan certainly got more impacted during COVID waves, I think, even than some other regions in the last year probably. And so as that stabilizes, we think that, that helps. And as Bernard said, we did see growth year-over-year and sequential. We just probably had higher expectations. And I think that's what's reflected in our comments. But we're optimistic in the back half of the year that we're going to continue to see recovery in Japan, and that's all factored into our guidance. On PROGRESS, we don't have any updates on enrollment right now. I will say, overall, we've been pleased with how that trial has gone. But probably investor conferences when we'll probably provide a more fulsome update on that and probably some more projections, we'll have a lot more information under our belt then that we can probably be a little more fulsome probably a little bit more accurate about our projections.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Please state your question.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Scott, the 3Q EPS guidance is a little bit lower than the Street was modeling. It looks like operating margin is expected to contract by a couple of hundred basis points versus where you were in the first half and then bounce back in 4Q. Is there anything in particular about the third quarter that drives that margin dip?\nScott Ullem: Well, the only thing particularly about Q3 is we pick up the summer seasonality, which hits us on the top line. And generally, the expenses continue to go through and are not as seasonal. That's really what it reflects.\nChris Pasquale: Okay. And I know Cath is not on the call today, but just looking at the Critical Care guidance, that business has been running hot here double-digit growth first half of the year. It looks like guidance assumes a pretty meaningful decel in the back half. Is that just tougher comps or is there something in particular you're looking at there?\nBernard Zovighian: No, exactly. You got it. We had a great Q2 after a great Q1, very balanced across all product lines. And we didn't change the guidance even though we changed the guidance in the last quarter, but it is more about a tough year-over-year comparison in the second part of the year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to follow-up on this very strong performances in SAVR and good, but not as strong performance in TAVR and as it pertains to staffing. And I know you talked about price a little and volumes. But can you talk a little bit about given that TAVR interventional TAVR resources that sort of grew up during the clinical trials of TAVR across the clinical community in U.S., Europe kind of lost many of those folks who are maybe more proficient and are - good news, replacing them with other folks. But bad news, maybe some of those folks are still coming up the curve. If you could talk about - is that more of an issue on the TAVR side? And because SAVR surgical interventions are a bit more mature, that's less of an issue on - you've heard that from some centers that are sort of - are more productive, more skilled, more mature on one side versus the other, which is kind of one of the factors. But it would be great to get some color and then I have 1 quick follow-up?\nLarry Wood: Okay. Sure. Let me take a shot at that. So probably the biggest place we saw turnover on the TAVR side when things were about clinic coordinators. And I think we talked before about the number of valve clinic coordinators we train. And I think part of that is just a really demanding job. There's a lot that goes into that in terms of screening and moving people through the system. And so, I think there's a lot. So we see a little bit more turnover than that than certainly. And we don't really have the same level of work on the surgical side because on the TAVR side, remember, patients have to get a CT. They have to have a lot more work up. And not every patient gets the - most surgical patients, in fact, don't get a CT. And so, it's just easier to move surgical patients through the process because literally, if a patient comes in and they're deemed a candidate for surgery, they can move right to surgery within a matter of a few days or a week. Where for TAVR, they're going to have to be scheduled for a CT, you got to roll out coronary disease and there's just other things that you have to do. So, there are pressure in staffing in the system that would have impacted across the whole system, but there's just more systems to impact on the TAVR side. We didn't lose our operators. If not - those aren't the people we lost. We didn't lose our operators. We still have a lot of residents and a lot of people coming up through the system. So it's not so much the implanting positions as much as it is just general support staff.\nMatt Miksic: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on - it's a question about some of the investments you've made and maybe group Bernard and rest of the team, the investments that we see coming through the clinical programs now like the EVOQUE and PASCAL or investments and innovations that you made some time ago. And I'm just wondering - are you at a stage where you've got what you need to address these TMTT markets and sort of more advanced other valvular disorders? Or are you still out there hunting for sort of better mousetraps or additional technology and IP that we should expect to kind of further flush out those programs going forward? Thanks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Matt. This is a very good question. So think about our vision in TMTT. Our vision is there are so many patients in need, mitral and tricuspid. And we believe that to be able to unlock this very large market opportunity, we need a comprehensive portfolio. And we are building this comprehensive portfolio. So what you can expect is us investing in innovation, next-gen innovation. So PASCAL Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4, the same with EVOQUE, the same with mitral replacement. So this is on the technology side. Then we know from our experience in TAVR, it is - you need a technology with evidence. In TAVR, we - I don't know how many randomized clinical study we did 3, 4, 5 or even more potentially in the space, probably close to 10 between us and our competition. So here, we will have to think about the same way. So we are - in my mind, we are not done at all in TMTT clinical evidence, and we are not done in term of further innovating to be able to treat all of the patients, mitral and tricuspid patients. We like definitely our technology, we like so far, our clinical evidence that we are providing and more to come.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Bernard or maybe, Larry, just on TAVR, two questions there. Number one, one of the things everyone's sort of trying to figure out as we move through Q2, is it impacted backlog. I know the high acuity nature of the TAVR procedure are likely not much backlog, and I know you did benefit marginally in Q1. Just curious if you think you saw any of that work down in Q2? That's the first question. Second question is just over the last few quarters, you gave some color on high volume versus low-volume centers driving a lot of the growth. Just curious if you could give some color there, whether this is really broad-based across low and high-volume centers. Thanks so much.\nLarry Wood: Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Yes, we think as the front end of the funnel starts to fill back up again with referrals and that I think there is a possibility that we are actually seeing a little bit of a backlog growth as we talk about the last mile still being probably the part that we see the most pressure on staffing. I wouldn't be able to quantify that and it's probably just sort of more of a directional thing. But the fact that we've seen the growth in TAVR for the first couple of quarters of this year, and we've been back into double digits and it's not like our centers are out beating the bushes for patients, we're pretty pleased with our patient flow right now. So I think that, that's obviously really positive. I think in terms of large centers, small centers, we saw a dynamic throughout COVID that when COVID would - with sort of the way it would come through that people - we tend to see the smaller centers growing faster indicating people maybe stayed a little bit more local. When COVID tends to go away, then people tend to go back to the centers, the large centers of excellence and they're willing to travel a little bit more. So I think we saw a little bit more growth in the large centers in this past quarter than we saw in the small centers, but that's something that has varied a lot quarter-by-quarter. But this last quarter would have been more in the large centers than the small ones.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Please state your question.\nRichard Newitter: Thanks for taking the questions. Two here. The first one, just on reconciling the raise to the high end of the TAVR range and your Japan commentary relative to expectations. Do you need Japan in a dynamic way to improve in the second half to hit the midpoint of your guidance? Or is that kind of what's embedded to get to the upper end? I'm just trying to reconcile those two pieces.\nScott Ullem: Yes. We're expecting Japan to perform better in Q3 and Q4, and that's a contributor to our assumption about the midpoint of the range. Now Japan does better than we're expecting, that could get us into the higher end of the range. And if it does worse, then a lower end of the range. All of that said, Japan is still a pretty small percentage of our overall sales in TAVR, but it's an important one, and it's an important growth driver for us longer term.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. And then just secondly - thanks for that. Secondly, just as we think about - especially in the U.S. TAVR, if you're at about 10% now, you've got RESILIA pricing contributing some amount. So I guess if you're 10% with RESILIA, as we just think out, whether it's '24 or just on a normalized basis, should we be thinking of your view that the TAVR market has approached high single-digit volume growth sustainably as we think back to normalized levels. Is that the right way to think about it?\nLarry Wood: I'll try to answer that, and Bernard or Scott can certainly jump in as well. No, we don't think we're seeing an overall slowing of growth in the TAVR space. We think we actually have a pretty long runway here. We think there's still a lot of untreated patients in the system, and we continue to try to get through that. And as I said earlier, I still feel like we're somewhat constrained within the system for staffing and we still put double-digit growth on the board in the first two quarters. So I feel like there's still a long-term opportunity, and we haven't even begun to talk about the long-term impact of things like early TAVR and things like progress trial that obviously go out much further. So I think - try to think that this is going to go the way of population growth anytime soon. That's just not how we see it.\nScott Ullem: I'd just add to that, Larry, just to reinforce that, our confidence in a $10 billion total addressable market hasn't changed one bit in 2028. And so while COVID interrupted our trajectory to that larger TAM, we still feel a lot of confidence that we've got big growth ahead of us, not just in with current indications in our current product portfolio but added to that, our new technologies and broader indications in the U.S., Europe and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nPito Chickering: Hi. Good afternoon. So two quick questions here. For the U.S. markets, are there - is there any geographical spread for these large centers that are growing in markets that were still coming out of COVID versus the ones in the south that were faster coming out of COVID? Or was it broad-based geographically?\nLarry Wood: Yes. When we were in the middle of COVID, we saw a lot of variation in the country based on where COVID was at any given point and because there was a lot of variation in health care policy for various different states in terms of how they reacted. So we saw a lot of different variations. I would say most of those restrictions have sort of dissipated now. And I don't - we're not seeing anywhere near that high variability from state to state or region to region that we used to see, and that's certainly true in the U.S. In Europe, we do see a little bit of regional impact a little bit more, where one regional enrolling faster than another region. But it's not anywhere near the exchange that we saw during COVID, where we saw huge swings now. They're much more muted now. And I would say we -- if I look back through history, we've always seen a little variation in Europe from country to country. So it feels like it's maybe not normal, but it's getting pretty close to normal, I guess, I'd say.\nPito Chickering: Okay. Fair enough. And then like with the competitor talking about lower U.S. growth in mitral and they need to restart the referral network. Can you talk about what you think the overall mitral market grew in the market, how your market share is looking and any changes to your long-term market growth of that market?\nBernard Zovighian: So let me start here and Daveen, you can add some comments. What we have seen is a nice recovery in Q1 and in Q2 in the mitral market in the U.S. and even in Europe. But I'm sure, Daveen, you have more precise commentary here to add?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, sure. No, definitely. I think I'll follow up and I say the overall TMTT market with both tricuspid and mitral continues to grow very well on a global basis, right, in that -- close to that maybe 20% kind of mark, globally. In the U.S., though, to specifically we're just in mitral, we do see strong growth. I think, Bernard, were saying something like almost like double-digit growth, which is about the ballpark we kind of see in for U.S. mitral. So we think it's there, but not as strong as it is on the global nature. As you remember, in many countries of the world, these technologies are just coming for the first time in there. We're still launching this technology into many, many countries. We're in very few countries - there are countries in Europe, countries outside of Europe that we haven't even launched into yet. So we continue to see, as we launch in new countries, that will help the market grow as well as the continued adoption of mitral in the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please state your question.\nAdam Maeder: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for squeezing in here. Two TAVR-related questions, I'll ask them both upfront. First on the ALLIANCE study, it sounds like that's going to restart enrollment this quarter. Can you just talk about the effects or improvements to get SAPIEN X4 back in the clinic? And remind us where we are in terms of enrollment with that study. And then the second question is just a clarification on S3 Ultra RESILIA. I know you're launching that, obviously, here in the States. I think that's approved in Japan in launching. What is the status that - of that technology in Europe? Thanks for taking the questions.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Thanks. Well, in terms of the changes we made to X4, they were all delivery system related. So there weren't any changes made to the valve or anything along those lines, which is why we were able to make the changes pretty quickly and get back in the clinic. And so we're really pleased where we are. And we're all approved to begin enrollment. Now all the centers have to go back in and go back to the IRBs and whatnot. But we have a number of centers that are already greenlight and ready to go. So we expect to begin enrollment again very, very shortly. And I'm not ready to give an update on enrollment, much probably like PROGRESS. We'll probably do that at the investor conference once we have a little bit more of a run because it's not really about where we are, it's projecting where we think we're going to finish. And so I'd rather give you a more fulsome answer on that a little bit later. S3 UR, we're working with European regulators on that. But remember, there's been a huge change in the regulations in Europe to the MDR process. And there's also just a huge bottleneck in terms of the number of devices that are working their way through the system there. So we don't have any timing on that. Frankly, all the notified bodies are sort of learning about how the new regulations play and as are all the sponsors. So we don't have any timing on that yet. But we do have it approved in Japan, and that launch is well underway. We do have it approved in the U.S., and that's underway. And in both of those markets, we expect that to be the majority platform as we exit the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Bernard Zovighian for closing remarks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Diego. So let me close this meeting by saying I am excited about our performance so far in 2023 and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. In addition, beyond the numbers, I am pleased with our progress on pipeline development, clinical trial and confidence in our long-term strategy to help even more patients. Thank you for your continued interest in Edwards, Mark, Oliver, Scott and I welcome any additional questions by phone.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Hi, Robbie. Yes, it's what - deciding what the new normal is probably a little bit tricky, but I feel like the system has continued to get better. I think when we track staffing, we're not where we should be and we're not where we would have projected to be in absence of the pandemic. But I think patients are certainly coming in and they're getting their visits, and I think when we look at some of the leading indicators, we - diagnosis are up and patients are moving through the system. We still feel constrained somewhat at the Cath Lab level. That's still a place that we still struggle. And I think centers have made tremendous strides, but it's still an adjustment coming out of COVID and we're not back to what I call pre-COVID normal levels. And so, I think we still have a little ways to go. But to consider the - and I think we see that a little bit globally. It varies a lot across Europe and we see it a little bit in Japan, depending on - I think there are still dealing with a little bit more COVID here and there. But I think the encouraging thing is, we're at 10% globally and we know we haven't fully recovered yet. So, I think there's still some opportunity for us to continue to do better and we know the under-treatment remains huge and we still think there's a lot of opportunities to continue to grow this over the long-term. Yes. I think that's right. We sort of have the three components that help contribute. So you can look at the growth rates and turn it all into procedures because for the TAVR side it is overwhelmingly majority procedures, but it's more of a combination of things, on surgery. I will say, as we move through the COVID recovery though we probably saw hospitals prioritize their surgical programs probably most and I think that deal is a little bit with patient acuity and just the need to get those patients treated, probably a little bit sooner. So I think cath lab recovery has maybe lagged a little bit beyond the surgical recovery. But again, we're very happy with where we saw TAVR procedure growth. this last quarter. Larry, I can't speak to the - to the data or what's going to be presented. I think what people are going to be looking at is, what the trial was powered for, and what it was designed to do. And we have a composite endpoint of death, or stroke, and rehospitalization and those are the three components. So, I think first and foremost, you look at the primary and then I think people are going to look at the sub-components of that and say what do they see happening in the trends in the trial. And I think, that's what people are going to be looking for. But we're excited that the data is coming forward, and the team is going to continue pulling it in and once it's all adjudicated, the clinicians will obviously take the steering wheel and they'll present the data. But, I think overall every time we have one of these data reports, it just adds to our body of knowledge and adds to the body of evidence and I think that's what we do for the clinical community. So, again, that's - I think primarily we focus on the primary endpoint, just like we did in the trial and we'll see where we are. Yes, thanks for your question. Yes, the price is a pretty small factor in the U.S. growth number. It's overwhelmingly driven by the procedure growth. When you look at what we're going for RESILIA, for S3 UR. We're still in the - I call it the - I wouldn't call it necessarily the early part, but we haven't even reached halfway in the launch of RESILIA yet. And while we did go for a list price increase of 1,500, if you look at that as a percent of the total device cost, it's a lot smaller than what we did on the surgical side of things. So it's certainly a contributor and it's a long-term contributor for us, but it's pretty small in comparison to the procedure growth. And remember, too, as people's volumes go up, they continue to hit rebate tiers and they get discounted accordingly. So you got to factor all that in as well. Yes, I think that's right. I think Japan certainly got more impacted during COVID waves, I think, even than some other regions in the last year probably. And so as that stabilizes, we think that, that helps. And as Bernard said, we did see growth year-over-year and sequential. We just probably had higher expectations. And I think that's what's reflected in our comments. But we're optimistic in the back half of the year that we're going to continue to see recovery in Japan, and that's all factored into our guidance. On PROGRESS, we don't have any updates on enrollment right now. I will say, overall, we've been pleased with how that trial has gone. But probably investor conferences when we'll probably provide a more fulsome update on that and probably some more projections, we'll have a lot more information under our belt then that we can probably be a little more fulsome probably a little bit more accurate about our projections. Okay. Sure. Let me take a shot at that. So probably the biggest place we saw turnover on the TAVR side when things were about clinic coordinators. And I think we talked before about the number of valve clinic coordinators we train. And I think part of that is just a really demanding job. There's a lot that goes into that in terms of screening and moving people through the system. And so, I think there's a lot. So we see a little bit more turnover than that than certainly. And we don't really have the same level of work on the surgical side because on the TAVR side, remember, patients have to get a CT. They have to have a lot more work up. And not every patient gets the - most surgical patients, in fact, don't get a CT. And so, it's just easier to move surgical patients through the process because literally, if a patient comes in and they're deemed a candidate for surgery, they can move right to surgery within a matter of a few days or a week. Where for TAVR, they're going to have to be scheduled for a CT, you got to roll out coronary disease and there's just other things that you have to do. So, there are pressure in staffing in the system that would have impacted across the whole system, but there's just more systems to impact on the TAVR side. We didn't lose our operators. If not - those aren't the people we lost. We didn't lose our operators. We still have a lot of residents and a lot of people coming up through the system. So it's not so much the implanting positions as much as it is just general support staff. Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Yes, we think as the front end of the funnel starts to fill back up again with referrals and that I think there is a possibility that we are actually seeing a little bit of a backlog growth as we talk about the last mile still being probably the part that we see the most pressure on staffing. I wouldn't be able to quantify that and it's probably just sort of more of a directional thing. But the fact that we've seen the growth in TAVR for the first couple of quarters of this year, and we've been back into double digits and it's not like our centers are out beating the bushes for patients, we're pretty pleased with our patient flow right now. So I think that, that's obviously really positive. I think in terms of large centers, small centers, we saw a dynamic throughout COVID that when COVID would - with sort of the way it would come through that people - we tend to see the smaller centers growing faster indicating people maybe stayed a little bit more local. When COVID tends to go away, then people tend to go back to the centers, the large centers of excellence and they're willing to travel a little bit more. So I think we saw a little bit more growth in the large centers in this past quarter than we saw in the small centers, but that's something that has varied a lot quarter-by-quarter. But this last quarter would have been more in the large centers than the small ones. I'll try to answer that, and Bernard or Scott can certainly jump in as well. No, we don't think we're seeing an overall slowing of growth in the TAVR space. We think we actually have a pretty long runway here. We think there's still a lot of untreated patients in the system, and we continue to try to get through that. And as I said earlier, I still feel like we're somewhat constrained within the system for staffing and we still put double-digit growth on the board in the first two quarters. So I feel like there's still a long-term opportunity, and we haven't even begun to talk about the long-term impact of things like early TAVR and things like progress trial that obviously go out much further. So I think - try to think that this is going to go the way of population growth anytime soon. That's just not how we see it. Yes. When we were in the middle of COVID, we saw a lot of variation in the country based on where COVID was at any given point and because there was a lot of variation in health care policy for various different states in terms of how they reacted. So we saw a lot of different variations. I would say most of those restrictions have sort of dissipated now. And I don't - we're not seeing anywhere near that high variability from state to state or region to region that we used to see, and that's certainly true in the U.S. In Europe, we do see a little bit of regional impact a little bit more, where one regional enrolling faster than another region. But it's not anywhere near the exchange that we saw during COVID, where we saw huge swings now. They're much more muted now. And I would say we -- if I look back through history, we've always seen a little variation in Europe from country to country. So it feels like it's maybe not normal, but it's getting pretty close to normal, I guess, I'd say. Sure. Thanks. Well, in terms of the changes we made to X4, they were all delivery system related. So there weren't any changes made to the valve or anything along those lines, which is why we were able to make the changes pretty quickly and get back in the clinic. And so we're really pleased where we are. And we're all approved to begin enrollment. Now all the centers have to go back in and go back to the IRBs and whatnot. But we have a number of centers that are already greenlight and ready to go. So we expect to begin enrollment again very, very shortly. And I'm not ready to give an update on enrollment, much probably like PROGRESS. We'll probably do that at the investor conference once we have a little bit more of a run because it's not really about where we are, it's projecting where we think we're going to finish. And so I'd rather give you a more fulsome answer on that a little bit later. S3 UR, we're working with European regulators on that. But remember, there's been a huge change in the regulations in Europe to the MDR process. And there's also just a huge bottleneck in terms of the number of devices that are working their way through the system there. So we don't have any timing on that. Frankly, all the notified bodies are sort of learning about how the new regulations play and as are all the sponsors. So we don't have any timing on that yet. But we do have it approved in Japan, and that launch is well underway. We do have it approved in the U.S., and that's underway. And in both of those markets, we expect that to be the majority platform as we exit the year."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Great. Hi, thanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased with our sales performance in the first half of the year, posting our second consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. All product groups grew double-digits and sales were balanced across regions, with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by the trialing of competitive TAVR products. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.53 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year constant currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Contribution from our better-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by higher performance-based compensation and investments in our transcatheter operations in support of our growth strategy. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 was impacted by the intellectual property agreement I commented on last quarter. We previously had a long-term Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic that expired last year and in consideration for the new agreement, we paid $300 million, approximately half of which has been expensed, and the other half will be amortized over the next 15 years. A reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. I'll now cover some additional details of our second quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more stable hospital staffing environment, as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based by country. We still see some health system capacity challenges, but are encouraged that centers are adapting to continue to treat their patients. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations in Q2, we anticipate that growth rates will improve, driven by the ongoing launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. For global TAVR sales, we are adjusting the low-end of our outlook slightly higher to $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion. We now expect full year TAVR growth to be 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. TMTT growth in the second quarter was driven by strong procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform, and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. Overall, we're pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with contemporary clinical data, in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $180 million to $200 million versus our previous expectation of $170 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, 13% constant currency sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards' premium products as well as strength in valve surgery procedures as hospital staffing levels have continued to improve. Based on positive year-to-date performance, we now expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion versus previous guidance of $870 million to $970 million. This revised range implies low double-digit constant currency growth in 2023. Finally, turning to Critical Care. We continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based on the strong first half of the year, we now forecast full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion versus prior guidance of the high-end of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. We now expect full year total Company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Lastly, we now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting third quarter sales to be between $1.44 billion and $1.52 billion. We are also projecting third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 to $0.61. I'll now cover additional details of our P&L. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.7% as expected, compared to 80.5% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $469 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $409 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by performance-based compensation and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 8% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. During the second quarter, we recorded a $27 million reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.04. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. This reflects an adjustment of assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for a previous acquisition. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 9.7% or 13.1% excluding the impact of special items. Our rate benefited from higher R&D tax credits and a 200 basis point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to 2022. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full year 2023 sales compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $286 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $34 million, less capital spending of $48 million, and excluding a $300 million payment related to the Medtronic Intellectual Property Agreement I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30th. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between 610 million and 615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, I'll hand it back over to you, Bernard. Thank you. And then about the financial implications of everything that Bernard and Daveen just talked about, which is, we're feeling good about how TMTT is developing in 2023. And you saw our original guidance for sales was $160 million to $200 million. We've bumped up the bottom-end of the range by $10 million last quarter. We're bumping at another $10 million this quarter and it's an indication of how positive we feel about our progress this year. Yes, thanks for the questions. I'll start with gross margin. Gross margin, we're seeing some benefit of mix in 2023, but it's more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange, that actually hit us last year in 2022 and is flowing through our income statement in 2023. You asked about phasing. It's going to get more impactful negatively in Q3 and Q4, based upon current exchange rates. Now, if exchange rates change, that may change a little bit as well. But we're expecting gross margins to come down a little bit in Q3 and Q4 relative to the first half. All that said, we expect to end up right where we thought we would, in the range of gross margin guidance for 2023, so really nothing changed. In terms of operating expenses, you're right, we've been putting more investment into especially field based personnel in Europe, in U.S., and even outside, and that's weighing on operating expenses, but that's okay. It's part of a deliberate plan to really drive top-line growth by making sure that we've got the right people in the right places, supporting our clinician partners, and making sure that patients are getting the right kind of care, especially as we're introducing these new products in places like TMTT, and what Daveen talked about earlier. As it relates to operating margin progression over the next couple of years, we continue to see opportunities to expand our operating margin and we're looking for ways that we can do that. We've identified areas where we can make changes, and gradually incrementally expand our operating margin. But really it's a secondary focus. The primary focus is investing for long-term top-line growth. We have some clinical trials wind-down over the next couple of years, but we've got other ones spooling up. You know about what trials Larry is running in TAVR, and Daveen has gone in TMTT, and this is a super important area of investment for us, again to drive top-line sales by contributing to this really robust body of clinical evidence that we have supporting the growth in those two transcatheter businesses. Yes. Vijay, maybe I'll jump in here and give you a sense of how we see it. The change in guidance, the expansion on the top-end of the range, largely reflects better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and the first half results compared to what we originally expected back at the time of the Investor Conference. And so, because we over-achieved in the first half, we are introducing this higher top-end of the range to accommodate a potential faster growth scenario the way we saw earlier in the year. We're still modeling and planning around the midpoint of that 10% to 13% range, but that's the reason why we expanded the top-end. Yes. It's Scott. A couple of things. The increase in the guide was largely reflective of our stronger-than-expected first half performance and the prospect of potentially overachieving what we had modeled for the second half, although we're still modeling the midpoint of that range that we provided. As far as the July expectation, I guess we'll just leave it as the range that we put out for total company sales in the third quarter incorporates what we see so far month to-date. But we're not going to get into the month-to-month report. In terms of what the later in the year trend may look like, a lot of it depends upon seasonality. We get hit by the summer vacation season and not just in Europe but also in the U.S. And so we'll be able to talk more about that impact when we get to our third quarter call, both for looking back on the third quarter and what the run rate looks like going into Q4. Well, the only thing particularly about Q3 is we pick up the summer seasonality, which hits us on the top line. And generally, the expenses continue to go through and are not as seasonal. That's really what it reflects. Yes. We're expecting Japan to perform better in Q3 and Q4, and that's a contributor to our assumption about the midpoint of the range. Now Japan does better than we're expecting, that could get us into the higher end of the range. And if it does worse, then a lower end of the range. All of that said, Japan is still a pretty small percentage of our overall sales in TAVR, but it's an important one, and it's an important growth driver for us longer term. I'd just add to that, Larry, just to reinforce that, our confidence in a $10 billion total addressable market hasn't changed one bit in 2028. And so while COVID interrupted our trajectory to that larger TAM, we still feel a lot of confidence that we've got big growth ahead of us, not just in with current indications in our current product portfolio but added to that, our new technologies and broader indications in the U.S., Europe and beyond."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yes, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I think as Larry and Bernard talked about, in the market, we continue to see recovery from the staffing portion of it and I think you're right that maybe we got hit a little bit more on the staffing side during COVID. But coming out, we're also still seeing recovery, but I still think there is opportunity to keep getting better on that component. With that being said, with such a large number of - such a large number of patients looking for new therapies, we continue to see relatively a strong market growth. That being said, as we dive into it, we continue to open up new centers in both the U.S. and Europe. Specifically in the U.S., I think we're continuing to hear great feedback from physicians about the differentiated features and benefits of the PASCAL system. We're ramping-up the team. We're opening up new centers each week. We're going through kind of the value-add value analysis committees in the contracting processes with each new center in the U.S. week-in and week-out. And we're really focused, as you can imagine, on the largest accounts in the U.S., not -- who do the most here so far. And so, I'm pretty excited about where we go in the U.S. Maybe just to comment, both on Europe, I think, as Bernard said, we've been again opening up new centers in Europe and I want to make a comment that, tricuspid especially in Europe, continued to see very strong growth. It's a newer therapy, smaller obviously in market size, but continue to see very strong growth, where we're seeing that the market is growing and that people are really seeing that PASCAL actually in this situation, the tricuspid space, is really got these differentiated features for atraumatic and tailored-treatment really for tricuspid tier. So, overall, we continue to be excited about where PASCAL is going in it's lunch. Also two small points, thanks for the question. If that - this interim analysis was a part of the statistical plan. So, that's already been planned out and was always a part to kind of show these results. So we're excited to share these results with the clinical community. And I'll make a comment that, for us, I'm actually pretty excited by what we've seen actually previously with TRILUMINATE. It helps really confirm outcomes that have come from other studies with Tier Technologies that we have on PASCAL device, that - that Tier in tricuspid delivers great Trikafta reduction with meaningful quality-of-life improvements and we are excited to see randomized data. So to me, these are all great positive tailwinds in tricuspid and we're excited to see what the TRISCEND II interim planned analysis will show. Yes, sure. No, definitely. I think I'll follow up and I say the overall TMTT market with both tricuspid and mitral continues to grow very well on a global basis, right, in that -- close to that maybe 20% kind of mark, globally. In the U.S., though, to specifically we're just in mitral, we do see strong growth. I think, Bernard, were saying something like almost like double-digit growth, which is about the ballpark we kind of see in for U.S. mitral. So we think it's there, but not as strong as it is on the global nature. As you remember, in many countries of the world, these technologies are just coming for the first time in there. We're still launching this technology into many, many countries. We're in very few countries - there are countries in Europe, countries outside of Europe that we haven't even launched into yet. So we continue to see, as we launch in new countries, that will help the market grow as well as the continued adoption of mitral in the U.S."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to share with you the work that our team did to help more patients than even before with our life-saving therapies. Today, I'm going to talk about the strong second quarter performance across product groups, our progress in advancing our patient-focused innovation strategy, and our confidence in the outlook for Edwards in the years ahead. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth, driven by increased adoption of our innovative therapies. Total sales of $1.53 billion grew 12% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than our expectation. We experienced broad-based growth across all of Edwards portfolio. Given improving healthcare staffing and our first half performance, we continue to expect strong results in 2023. As a result, we have lifted our full year 2023 sales and EPS guidance. Longer-term, we are confident in our focused and differentiated strategy given heart valve failure is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We remain committed to increasing our wellness and providing innovative life-saving therapies so even more patients can benefit. Now, I will provide an overview of the second quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with sales of $992 million, up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rate were comparable. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our second quarter TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels, and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We estimate that total procedure growth was in-line with our sales growth. Additionally, we will be restarting enrollment this quarter in our pivotal trial, ALLIANCE, designed to study of next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. Outside of the U.S., we had positive constant currency sales growth from all regions. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth were driven by broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. Our sales in Japan grew sequentially and year-over-year on a constant currency basis, although our results continued to be impacted by lower-than-expected market growth and competitive trialing in the first half of this year. As a result, we estimate overall OUS TAVR procedure growth in Q2 was slightly higher than Edwards' OUS TAVR growth. During the quarter, at the EuroPCR medical congress, data on the Benchmark study were presented on 2,400 patients treated with SAPIEN valves across 28 European centers. It was very encouraging to note that patients experienced a 33% reduction in the median hospital length of stay while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes. This study showed that by implementing best practices with the SAPIEN platform, centers can be more efficient, without compromising patient outcomes. Turning to TMTT. We remain focused on three key value drivers to unlock this opportunity: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcome. TMTT second quarter global sales of $48 million increased nearly 17% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Growth was driven by continued strong overall procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform, and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We continue to hire, train, and grow the field team to deliver on our high-touch model, as we expand. In mitral, enrollment is going -- is ongoing in the Class IIF pivotal trial for functional mitral patients. We are also pleased with the enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for the SAPIEN M3 mitral valve replacement and remain on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year. In tricuspid, the Class IITR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues enrolling well. With the completion of TRISCEND II enrollment, continued access for EVOQUE allows U.S. centers to continue to offer this therapy for tricuspid patients. We remain on track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and U.S. approval around the end of 2024. In Surgical, second quarter sales of $256 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by the adoption of our premium RESILIA products across all regions. Physicians and patients value the feature and benefit of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve procedures. Patient enrollment continued in the second quarter for our MOMENTIS clinical study designed to demonstrate the durability of the RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. We expect that confidence from our -- from the recently presented seven-year data of our upcoming clinical trial will continue to support adoption of our RESILIA family of products. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of, $235 million, increased 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by contributions from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and healthy adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor. Sales momentum for our HemoSphere monitoring platform was also positive in the second quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. Before I turn it over to Scott, I also want to mention our expectation for the upcoming TCT Conference in October. During the conference, we expect several important presentations regarding our transcatheter technologies. In TAVR, we are expecting a presentation of five-year clinical data from the PARTNER 3 low-risk pivotal trial. In TMTT, we anticipate the presentation of a one-year full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial results. Additionally, we anticipate the presentation of the planned interim analysis of the TRISCEND II randomized cohort. I look forward to seeing many of you at the Investor Event we plan to host at TCT. Our Investor Relation team will communicate details as we get closer to the event. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. So, based on our strong first half result, we have increased confidence that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards and we expect to deliver 10% to 15% sales growth while making meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Longer-term, I have great confidence in our team to further extend our leadership position by bringing our differentiated technologies to patients globally. In closing, we are well positioned for success. With that, I'll pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A. Yes. Robbie, this is Bernard here. Thank you for the question. We are pleased with our global TAVR result in Q2. 10% constant currency growth, comparable U.S., OUS, basically, and it has been driven by continued strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform. Also, what we have experienced is that improvement in the hospital staffing level in the U.S. and globally, but I'm going to let Larry add some comments here. Yes. So, let me start, Robbie, and then I will ask Daveen to add some comments here. So, we are pleased about Q2, as you see globally. What we are seeing is that the market, the mitral market has done well in Q2, is back to growing and almost a double-digit, something like that. The adoption of PASCAL Precision is going very well. It's going very well in U.S., it's going very well in Europe and we are activating more centers across U.S. and Europe. So, obviously, the way to think about it, we had some great momentum from the market from PASCAL Precision and for us activating more centers. But Daveen, you want to add anything here? Go ahead, you know, Scott. Yes. So, Vijay, let me start and then I will ask Larry to add his comment here. So, both, our SAVR and TAVR business are growing nicely. And you have SAVR growth has exceeded TAVR because of a combination of things. Market growth, SAVR market growth, but not only, premium pricing of our innovative, price premium technologies, and because of all of that, we saw a better competitive position. So, again in SAVR, what you have is a number of things happening. Wherein TAVR, it is mainly due to positive growth. Maybe Larry you want to add anything here. Thank you, Larry. I see that you are aggressive. That's good. Look, we are - yes, indeed we completed the enrollment of the full cohort of TRISCEND II. I think we have been sharing that already in the past. We need to wait - we need to wait one year follow-up and then putting together all of the data, presenting that to the FDA. So, this is going to take some time, so which is why we still believe that around 2024 approval in the U.S. is reasonable. Are we going to go faster, for sure, but I think end of 2024 is reasonable. Now, I'm sure, your question about how do I - how do we feel about steady results is in light of what we have seen with TRILUMINATE. It is tough to comment because TRILUMINATE was using one technology. TRISCEND II is using a different technology, different devices. We don't know very little about tricuspid disease. So, it's very tough to comment on that, but I have to say that quality-of-life is super important for patients. So, we will - but again, we will have to see what the result of this study and we are confident. Daveen, you want to add anything here? Thank you, Josh. So in Japan, what we have seen is a positive, like I said, sequential and also year-over-year growth in the quarter. It was below our expectation, but we believe it is transient for a couple of reasons. One, of the market, as you know, the market is still impacted from COVID and is still recovering from COVID. And also, we believe it is transient, because we are very pleased with the early feedback of the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan. So, we feel like we grew year-over-year sequentially below our expectation, but we are confident that we are going to improve this in Japan. Maybe, Larry, you want to add anything here? No, exactly. You got it. We had a great Q2 after a great Q1, very balanced across all product lines. And we didn't change the guidance even though we changed the guidance in the last quarter, but it is more about a tough year-over-year comparison in the second part of the year. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Matt. This is a very good question. So think about our vision in TMTT. Our vision is there are so many patients in need, mitral and tricuspid. And we believe that to be able to unlock this very large market opportunity, we need a comprehensive portfolio. And we are building this comprehensive portfolio. So what you can expect is us investing in innovation, next-gen innovation. So PASCAL Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4, the same with EVOQUE, the same with mitral replacement. So this is on the technology side. Then we know from our experience in TAVR, it is - you need a technology with evidence. In TAVR, we - I don't know how many randomized clinical study we did 3, 4, 5 or even more potentially in the space, probably close to 10 between us and our competition. So here, we will have to think about the same way. So we are - in my mind, we are not done at all in TMTT clinical evidence, and we are not done in term of further innovating to be able to treat all of the patients, mitral and tricuspid patients. We like definitely our technology, we like so far, our clinical evidence that we are providing and more to come. So let me start here and Daveen, you can add some comments. What we have seen is a nice recovery in Q1 and in Q2 in the mitral market in the U.S. and even in Europe. But I'm sure, Daveen, you have more precise commentary here to add? Thanks, Diego. So let me close this meeting by saying I am excited about our performance so far in 2023 and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. In addition, beyond the numbers, I am pleased with our progress on pipeline development, clinical trial and confidence in our long-term strategy to help even more patients. Thank you for your continued interest in Edwards, Mark, Oliver, Scott and I welcome any additional questions by phone."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Diego, and thank you everyone for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; Scott Ullem, CFO; and Bernard Zovighian, President of Edwards Lifesciences. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of TMTT; and Katie Zimon our Global Leader of Critical Care.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\nMichael Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. We're pleased with our first quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations and reflected an improvement in the healthcare staffing along with strong execution of our patient-focused innovation strategy. Sales of $1.46 billion represented 13% growth on a constant-currency basis versus a year-ago period. Strong therapy adoption of transcatheter heart valves drove the majority of growth in the first quarter aided by better-than-expected performance of Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care. By geography, strong growth in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world was partially offset by Japan where COVID impacts lingered. First quarter results in the U.S. were also positively impacted in the quarter by some catch-up in procedure volumes following a seasonal slowdown late last year. While staffing remains a concern at many sites globally, we are optimistic that the environment will continue to improve. In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $948 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew in the low-double-digits versus the prior year, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. As we indicated, we believe that first quarter trends were lifted by improved hospital staffing levels. Results were also lifted by a catch-up in procedure volumes early in the quarter following the holiday season slowdown. We're optimistic about the early results of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA launch in the U.S. As you know, the RESILIA tissues anti-calcification technology has demonstrated a strong track-record of performance in Edwards surgical valves. Adoptions of this advanced technology is proceeding well, and we expect it to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end. TAVR growth in the first quarter was driven by larger volume centers and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance. We're pleased with the continued enrollment of our PROGRESS clinical trials studying patients with moderate AS. Related to this, last month at the ACC Conference data were presented that examined mortality rates in cardiac damage of 600,000 early-stage AS patients in the U.S. This study concluded that all degrees of untreated AS severity were associated with increased mortality risk. Of note, that mean two-year all-cause mortality for moderate AS was approximately 20%, approaching the rate of those with severe AS. Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant-currency TAVR sales grew approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis. Growth reflected positive contributions from all regions, excluding Japan, which was still impacted by COVID and the recent trialing of competitive products. We expect to see higher OUS growth as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations, we were encouraged that conditions improved as the quarter progressed, and we expect COVID headwinds to diminish substantially over the course of 2023. With the launch of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan late last month, we expect growth rates to improve in this country where aortic stenosis remains significantly undertreated relative to other large developed countries. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Total TAVR procedures grew over previous quarters despite persistent disruptions related to hospital staffing shortages. It's encouraging that healthcare systems across Europe are prioritizing lifesaving structural heart therapies including TAVR amidst these challenges. Looking ahead to the EuroPCR Medical Congress next month in Paris, we anticipate additional data from the Edwards benchmark study focusing on strategies to optimize TAVR programs across 28 European centers. Data will also be presented on the outcomes of balloon expandable valves for TAVR in TAVR procedures. In summary, given the strength of our first quarter performance, we now expect constant-currency growth of 10% to 12% versus our previous expectation of 9%to 12%. Our outlook assumes that hospital resource constraints continue to improve during the year. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will increase to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low-double-digits. Turning to TMTT. Our confidence continues to grow in the long-term potential to transform care for the many patients with mitral and tricuspid disease who need better solutions. We remain steadfast on our three key value drivers to unlock this opportunity, developing a portfolio of differentiated therapies for the complex mitral and tricuspid anatomies, driving positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption, and prioritizing favorable real-world clinical outcomes. First quarter sales of $42 million grew substantially, driven by overall tier procedure growth, the ongoing launch and growing adoption of PASCAL Precision in Europe and the initial launch in the United States. We're pleased that we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients and clinician feedback on PASCAL Precision has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system. We are ramping production to support the launches of Europe and the U.S. In Mitral, we look forward to presenting one year data from the full cohort of CLASP IID pivotal trial later this year. Meanwhile, we continue to enroll the CLASP IIF pivotal trial with PASCAL for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, enrollment of ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is ongoing and we anticipate completing enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. We believe that this replacement therapy will expand options for a broader population of mitral patients. In tricuspid, we've completed enrollment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System and remain on-track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and in the U.S., around the end of 2024. The FDA recently approved continued access allowing U.S. hospitals that were involved in the clinical trial to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues enrolling well. In summary, we're pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $170 million to $200 million versus our previous $160 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, better-than-expected first quarter 2023 global sales of $248 million increased a robust 17% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by penetration of our premium products across all regions and valve surgery growth was higher than our expectations as hospital staffing levels improved leading to some catch-up in procedures. We continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. Surgeons and patients value the features and benefits of this proprietary tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. And we've seen adoption of the MITRIS Valve in the US increase in the first quarter. The 7-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons next month. We also began enrollment of our MOMENTIS clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position. In summary, based on our first quarter sales, we are raising our full year sales expectation to the high-end of our $870 million to $970 million guidance range. We now expect high-single-digit underlying growth in 2023, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and an increase in the overall heart valve surgeries. In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $222 million increased 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring our unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Demand for our Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and our HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. Based on the strong first quarter performance, we now expect Critical Care full-year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million versus our previous $840 million to $940 million. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we can to take continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Hi, thanks a lot, Mike. We are very pleased by our start to the year. Q1 was particularly strong in January relative to historical seasonality and the rest of the quarter was more consistent with our growth expectations. All product groups performed well, and sales were balanced across all regions with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by lingering COVID headwinds. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.46 billion, which represents 12.6% year-over-year constant-currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.62. Our GAAP EPS was $0.56 and impacted by an intellectual property agreement, which I will speak to later. Contribution from our stronger-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by a higher provision for performance-based compensation. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. For total Edwards, based on the strong start to the year, we now expect 10% to 12% year-over-year sales growth on a constant-currency basis, an increase from our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. We now expect to be at the high-end of our previous range of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. Absent material moves in foreign exchange, we now expect full-year TAVR sales of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion, TMTT sales of $170 million to $200 million and Critical Care sales of $870 million to $940 million. For Surgical Structural Heart, we now expect to be at the high-end of our previous guidance range of $870 million to $970 million. Lastly, we now expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $2.48 and $2.60. We're projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.48 billion and $1.56 billion. We're also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68. I'll now cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.5% as expected, compared to 77.8% in the same period last year and 81% in Q4. This slight year-over-year reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from FX. We continue to expect our full-year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $436 million, or 29.9% of sales, primarily reflecting increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. These investments were partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar. We continue to expect full-year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 14% over the prior year to $261 million, or 17.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full-year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.6%. This rate reflects a 70-basis-point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full-year tax-rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Earlier this month, we were pleased to enter into an intellectual property agreement with Medtronic in which we agreed to a 15-year mutual covenant not to sue with regard to certain structural heart products. We previously had a long-term IP agreement that expired last year. The terms of the new agreement limit what we disclose, but there will be a reference to it in our Form 10-Q, which we will file soon. In consideration for the agreement, we paid Medtronic $300 million, approximately half of which has been recorded as a one-time charge and the other half will be amortized over time. Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 380 percentage points, or $44 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full-year 2023 sales as compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $253 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $314 million less capital spending of $61 million. We continue to expect full-year 2023 free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $250 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well as pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 5 million shares to 611 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between 610 million and 615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike. But before I do, I know everyone on both ends of this call joins me in congratulating you on this your 92nd earnings call. We're now in our 10th year of working together, and it's been a privilege at every step along the way. Your leadership and support as the CEO of Edwards has been an inspiration to me, our employees and I know it's also fair to say the investment community. So with that, Mike, back to you.\nMichael Mussallem: Thanks so much, Scott. That means a lot and I've truly valued your trusted partnership over the years. It's also a great segue. As part of the upcoming planned CEO succession, Bernard has been serving as President of Edwards Lifesciences since January 1. Since then, we've invested all our time to successfully transition responsibilities and I feel confident passing the baton. Next month, I expect to transition to my new role as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and Bernard will assume the CEO role. I'm excited with the Board's selection of Bernard, and I'm confident that the company is in great hands and will prosper under his proven leadership. But before we go to Q&A, I'll ask Bernard to say a few words. Bernard?\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Mike. I feel extremely fortunate to be leading this special company that has pioneered breakthrough technologies and transformed care for patients around the world. During the well planned five month transition, Mike has been extremely generous in sharing learnings and experience, having successfully transformed Edwards over the last 20 plus years. I am also grateful for the support of the Board and the partnership of the executive leadership team. In recent months, I have had the pleasure of meeting and listening to our patients, our trusted pioneers and our employees around the world. I've come away from the discussion even more confident in Edwards' bright future. For our patients, we will continue to advance breakthrough innovation that will positively impact their lives. While Edwards has grown and evolved, we never lost sight of why we are here. We will stay focused on our long-term strategic goals and foster a patient-first culture and drive everything we do. We know healthcare innovation requires trusted partnership with physicians, regulators, peers, providers and innovators, and we will continue to build upon and further strengthen our deep partnerships to take on ambitious goals and address large unmet needs. Transforming care like we do at Edwards is complex. So we remain committed to fostering a culture where our employees really enjoy their impactful work. Our unique, organic innovation strategy requires an expert, motivated and dedicated global team. I want Edwards to continue to be a place that inspires our employees to grow and succeed and attract bright talent. As you heard from Mike and Scott, we believe that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards as we expect a return to higher sales growth and meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Looking beyond 2023, I remain confident that our long-term strategy and pipeline of innovative therapy will create significant value for patients and healthcare systems enabling strong organic sales growth. Finally, I am confident that as we deliver on our innovation strategy, we will create exceptional shareholder value. With that, I will pass it back to Mark to open up for Q&A.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Bernard. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue, and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Mike, I just want to say I think I've been at almost 70 of your 92 calls, so I just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you've accomplished at Edwards and wish you well on retirement. I just wanted to take a minute to say, I think your pursuit of transcatheter valves may seem obvious now, Mike, but we know that it was a big risk when you decided to go down that path and it was clearly the right decision. So, congratulations again, Mike, and I'll move on to my questions now. So I'd love to start just with two on TMTT. Just first on the TMTT results in the quarter, the $42 million. I'd love to hear a little bit about the U.S., OUS trends, how much does the U.S. contribute and just any color on the launch of PASCAL and I have one follow-up.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, why don't I get started. First of all, thanks so much Larry, that's very meaningful to me. And you're right, we've a long journey together and I really appreciate the support from the investment community. So why don't I turn it over to Bernard and Daveen to sort of answer your questions.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, sure. No thanks, Larry. Good question. You know about your TMTT, we are very pleased with the first quarter results. As you can imagine, we started in Europe way before and we also got approval in Europe for PASCAL Precision before the U.S. So it is going very well in Europe, but we have been in the U.S. now for quarter, quarter plus, and it is going well also, it is at the beginning of it, I don't know, Daveen, if you want to add anything here?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, I would also say, obviously, Europe's obviously been the majority of our revenue, but in the U.S. and in Europe we're in launch mode with PASCAL Precision. We've gotten really positive feedback so far from physicians, they love the technology. They see excellent safety and efficacy and we're continuing to grow, we're continuing to open new center, training physicians for the first time and giving exposure to this new great technology.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on TRILUMINATE. The reaction seem to be mixed from some physicians. I'd love to hear you guys, your reaction to the data and put EVOQUE what you've just completed the U.S. pivotal trial for TRISCEND II, the enrollment, I'm sorry. One would expect with replacement, you're going to see better efficacy in terms of TR reduction, but how confident are you that you'll see an improvement in outcomes such as mortality and hospitalization with the reasonable safety profile? Thank you for taking the questions.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, sure. Thanks Larry, it's Daveen again. I'll jump-in a little bit in our thoughts on TRILUMINATE. Honestly, on TRILUMINATE, we're very pleased to see a high-quality randomized controlled data for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation for the first time. We're excited to see that this trial show that tricuspid tier is not only see but offers significant TR reduction and also offers really meaningful quality-of-life for patients. And I think what we see is that the TRILUMINATE data actually kind of helps confirm outcomes that we've seen in previous PASCAL studies in the tricuspid space like our CLASP TR EFS TriCLASP study, et cetera, that we really see the significant TR reduction great safety and good quality of life. For us, obviously, the CLASP II TR study is ongoing, and maybe I'll give you some more potential on tricuspid tier therapy. But we also believe that you need a toolbox of technologies for tricuspid disease and that not only does tier offer a great solution, but we also think that tricuspid replacement also offers great solutions. Obviously, as the data comes out in the future will help figure out and impact a lot of the questions that you just asked right there, but I think we'll all figure this out together on this journey.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. And Mike, I'll add my congratulations as well. Maybe to start, I want to spend a minute on TAVR trends U.S. and OUS, and you said there was some pent-up demand at the beginning of the quarter, but then also it sounds like staffing continues to improve around the world. And if you get a little pricing benefit on SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA that might help sales throughout the year. So just love to get your thoughts on what you're seeing, do you think there was a bolus in January and a diet offer, or are these trends that can continue to improve and accelerate throughout the year?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, thanks Robbie and I appreciate your comments. Why don't we go to Larry on this one?\nLarry Wood: Yes, thanks Robbie. If I look at the quarter, we typically see a lot of seasonality in January as we come out of the holiday, just kind of refilling up the pipeline we're screening, and we saw a much stronger January than we historically have seen. I mean, we just saw less seasonality. I'd say, February and March, played out pretty much in-line with our expectations. We've anticipated that staffing was going to gradually improve, and I think we see that and I think that's evidenced in the Q1 results, but we expect it to also continue improve throughout the rest of the year. So in terms of trying to judge your backlog, I'm not really, it's hard for us to do that, but we do think there were certainly some catch-up in January.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And Scott, maybe one for you, OpEx came in a little higher than the Street had been expecting in the quarter, yet you reiterated the margin targets for the year. How should we think about the cadence of spending and anything in the first quarter that stood out to you that won't repeat going forward? Thanks.\nScott Ullem: Yes, so we did end up with higher spending in the first quarter than we had originally budgeted. Our plans for spending for the rest of the year really unchanged. And for the full year, our guidance for SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales are unchanged. In the first quarter, we came in a little bit higher for several reasons. We had some performance-based compensation. It's highly sensitive to sales by design. And so, we'd like to reward people when the topline is performing well. We also had some little things, some onetime one-off expenses for projects we're working on. We had a little bit higher tax rate as a result of income mix that came in U.S. and OUS. So those were some of the special things that you saw flow through in Q1.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good start here. And Mike, let me add my congratulations as well. I wanted go back to the prior question here on, when you look at TAVR, I think it was 4% or 5% in Q4, Q1 double-digit growth. Can you quantify what that improvement from mid-single to double digits, what part of that was perhaps a catch-up versus an underlying improvement in procedure trends and when you're thinking about procedure trends, can you perhaps talk about how the quarter progressed and what the exit rates were?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, thanks for your comments, Vijay. I appreciate that, and I'll give it to Larry. Although, I think he already gave it his best shot, but wanted to see if you have anything to add Larry, right?\nLarry Wood: Yes. I don't know if I have a lot more to add from the last question, you know, you'll note we took up the bottom of our range and I think so we tried to reflect all of this in our guidance, but we're just encouraged overall by the staffing trends and where we're going and I think to see TAVR back in double-digit growth after a couple of tough quarters just really I think highlights that the system is getting capacity back and I think that that's a real plus for patients.\nVijay Kumar: Maybe I'll try to ask this a different way, Larry. Let's see if we can pin this down. The SAVR, this is the second straight quarter SAVR is outgrowing TVAR. Is that 17%, what percentage of that 17% is what is volume versus price? And do you have any thoughts on why is SAVR continuing to outgrow TAVR? Shouldn't TAVR be growing faster than SAVR?\nLarry Wood: Yes, well I mean, I think first of all, we're very excited by the surgical growth that we saw in Q1. I think we probably reached probably at an all-time high, that we haven't seen in a long-time. I think that's really a reflection of the innovation and the investments we've made over the last several years, so I think part of this has been the adoption of our premium products and the premium we get and that certainly helps our competitive position and at the same time we did see procedure growth on that happened that I think we results from the capacity, similar to what we saw in TAVR. We saw that capacity improvements on the surgical side of our business as well, but we do get some of the price from our premium products in addition to the growth in the market and then probably a little bit of competitive position as well. So there's probably more drivers on the surgical side than there are on the TAVR side.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, volume versus price, Larry, can you comment whether majority of this growth was volume versus price on TAVR?\nLarry Wood: I mean, volume was certainly a key contributor to it and there's no question about that. So that's a big thing, but again yes there are three things that are contributing to the growth on the surgical business, whereas TAVR it's pretty much primarily units.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thanks guys and congrats again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening, and Mike, you will be missed, but nice quarter to do your 92nd quarter four. I just want to spend a little bit of time on Japan and China, and particularly in Japan, if you had a tough beginning of the quarter with COVID overhang, what is your run-rate looking like right now and just down there what's happening in the region?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, thanks, Joanne, and I appreciate your kind comments. Bernard, do you want to take a shot at that?\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, so Japan has been and still largely impacted by COVID headwinds. When we believe it is going to diminish over the course of 2023. We are also bringing our latest technology in Japan, S3 Ultra RESILIA and we are starting to see some positive reaction from our customers here. So together with the recovery from COVID and us bringing our latest technologies, we are very hopeful for the year.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, the other thing I can add, Joanne is that. China is still relatively small on the TAVR front for us. Remember we launched during the COVID years, but Japan is also going to benefit from the launch of the Ultra RESILIA product this year. And so, we think that's going to be a lift for Japan as the year goes on. And that's just launched here this last, this month.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks a lot and congrats Mike you'll be next as well. Couple of questions here, I guess the first just did you normalized January. I don't know, if you could say, the U.S. still grew double-digits, if you just normalize the January in Q1? But then the real question is like how to think about Q2 from here, both U.S. and worldwide TAVR, how much of a step-up we should expect in Q2 total - TAVR sales or growth rates or just any color on what to expect for Q2 in TAVR?\nMichael Mussallem: Okay. Thanks, Travis. I appreciate that. So, could you repeat your question about the Q1 growth, so I make sure we get it right?\nTravis Steed: Yes, of course, so January, if you normalize the January catch-up if you will, January looks more normal did the U.S. TAVR still grow double-digits or it's high single-digits?\nMichael Mussallem: Well again, just to try to expand, we typically see pretty fairly extreme seasonality in January where it's our worst month of the quarter. We just didn't see as much extremism, but January was by no means our strongest month. We continue to see a ramp in a quarter, it's just February and March were pretty much in-line with our expectations, but January was stronger, but it wasn't like it was our strongest month, so I hope that gives more context. And I think what we're seeing is the gradual improvement in staffing and I think what we've tried to build into our guidance is we took up the bottom of our range, because we felt we had a strong Q1, but it's kind of in our expectations now to be in that 10% to 12% range globally.\nScott Ullem: Yes so Travis, it's Scott. I'll just add to that, our guidance at the midpoint for Q1 was around 9% growth. That was the $1.41 billion. We beat that by $50 million, almost half of that was Surgical, and so we probably were rounded to low double-digits, something like that, if we were to normalize January, but we're getting pretty precise at this point trying to isolate every single month of the quarter.\nTravis Steed: Yes, that's helpful, and I guess the next question would be on the RESILIA rollout, in terms of where you're at in penetration there. And then as you move into 2024, how you're thinking about some of the competitive launches in the U.S.?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, we're very pleased with how the S3 UR rollout has gone. We're really following on in the footsteps of our surgical franchise, and RESILIA, which is on in INSPIRIS and now on MITRIS has become extremely popular with surgeons. And so, we get to follow the legacy that they've really started for us. And we've seen really positive impact from S3 UR. And we expect by the end of the year that that's going to be our leading platform in both the U.S. and Europe. And remember we went for a list price increase with that which is never easy to do and we've been pretty pleased with how that's gone so far and I think that just shows that positions respect and appreciate the value that RESILIA brings to the platform. So we're very encouraged with how the launch has gone to-date. We'll continue to roll it out through the rest of the year, but we do expect it to be our leading platform. I think you had a follow-up question on competitive launches, is that correct?\nTravis Steed: That's correct, yes.\nMichael Mussallem: I mean, competitive launches have been going on for a long time, if we look at Europe, there's a whole complement of products out there. And outside of number one and number two, all of the competitors command about probably around 15% of the market and that's been fairly stable. So I think it's for us it's more about us continuing to innovate and rolling out our leading platforms than it is about anything else.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Great and congrats on a better quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And Mike, we sound like a broken record over here. But it's the end of an era and you definitely will be missed, and it's been such a pleasure being on this journey with you as you have such a meaningful impact on so many patients' lives, so thanks for letting us share that with you. And I guess my first question is on the TAVR growth guidance for the year? And if you look at from a comp perspective, I mean Q1 is a tough comp, you guys put up 11% constant currency growth. So I guess that we had some sort of backlog worked down in January, but I guess my question is why not a little bit more aggressive on the TAVR growth guidance given the strong Q1 print, is there anything to consider as it relates to moving through the quarters, comps actually get easier as you move through the year. So just wondering if you could comment on that and then I have one quick follow-up?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, thanks so much for your nice comments, Danielle, it has been a pleasure for me. Why don't I turn this over to Scott to go through your question.\nScott Ullem: Yes, so I mean the short answer is, we did increase the bottom of our range. So we're expecting 10% to 12%, not 9% to 12%, it's not a huge move, but it does indicate that we had a nice January and we're still positive on the rest of the year. At this point, it's premature to start tinkering any more than that with guidance. We think this is the right modeling assumption for us in that 10% to 12% range for TAVR.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay. That's fair. And I think historically, you guys don't tend to release guidance very aggressively after the first quarter. So that's fair. And quick question for - on the TMTT side of things, I know it's very early in the U.S. on PASCAL launching, but Bernard just curious what you're seeing as it relates to market growth there and how much you're seeing that market recover, again, I know you guys are so early? So, not sure what you can say, but usually second entry comes to market and markets accelerate in a net tax, but just wondering if we're getting any signs on what market growth could look like going-forward there? Thanks so much.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes I know it's a fair question, indeed, we are pleased about the Q1. We have seen some positive signs that the market is recovering. I'm sure you remember the mitral market during COVID was not growing as expected and in Q1 we saw that the market was growing again. But again we are, if you think about the U.S., we are not the share leader, correct. So, we look at the market, we see a good sign that it is recovering and we are very pleased about the introduction of our technologies, our customers of reacting very well to PASCAL Precision, the seal of a differentiated benefit. So, we feel good about the impacts we can have here to this many patient in need. Thank you.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist. Please state your question.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So two from me I guess, just the first, I know we've talked about hospital staffing. Is that just a catch all phrase? I know in the past you said it's the whole worked up and everything for getting the patient diagnosed to the entire kind of worked up to referrals to getting the patient there. So with respect to the improvement that we saw from late last year, just trying to get a sense for - what specifically kind of are you referring to when you say hospital staffing is improving? And kind of the second question on that just I think you talked about in the past a very varied kind of level of recovery across your installed base. Any comments you can provide as to the - or characterize kind of where and which types of implanting centers are recovering and at what rates or was it just more uniform across the entire installed-base at this point? Thanks.\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, maybe I'll start, and I'll take your second question first, because it might take a couple of to answer your first question. I think we saw the growth being driven more by larger centers than smaller centers during this quarter and I think this is sort of a trend that we've seen throughout COVID. I think when COVID has spiked, we've seen people stay closer to home, we've seen probably more growth in the smaller centers. And as COVID wanes, we see people traveling, maybe a little bit further and going to larger centers. And so, I think this is consistent with trends we've seen over the last year and a half or so. In terms of, when we talk about staffing, it depends when you're talking about our surgical business our TAVR business. When you're talking about the surgical business, it's primarily OR staff and ICU nurses in sort of the post-care initiative. When you're talking about TAVR, there's a lot more that goes into it, because there's a lot more upfront workout. So it requires staffing improvements for CT and for angio and sort of the broader cath lab and we don't need it so much on the after-care side. So - I think we've seen, just generally, and I think hospitals have been working at this for probably better than a year now, trying to get people trained and get people in. I remember, you don't just hire a person and then they're effective from day-one. They have to go through a training process with that hospital, but I would say, generally speaking, you can look at the quarter and say, we saw staffing get better and - that's reflected in our and I think our broad performance. Well, we certainly saw it in TAVR, and we certainly saw with surgical. But it needs to continue to improve over the rest of the year. It's not like we're done yet. And I think hospitals continue to work hard at this maybe I'll ask Daveen to comment on the TMTT side what he saw.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes I mean. I think it's a similar kind of comment that you made there, probably not the differences where there's a lot of people, a lot of different steps that go into a TMTT case. And again, as Bernard said, we're still a minority player here. But we continue to be optimistic that all those different parts of the fall patient pathway are continuing to get a little bit better in staffing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please state your question. Matt Miksic, your line is open. Please go ahead un-mute yourself.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Thanks so much. Thanks for fitting me in. So a couple of just quick follow-ups here, so one on the color that you gave on RESILIA, I appreciate the target of kind of getting that to the majority of U.S. revenues by the end of the year on the TAVR platform, if I understood that correctly. But just broadly, I know you've had a policy of maintaining this kind of set price across your TAVR platform - even as you sort of moved it up to the generations of products, and that is a little bit unusual? Most companies in med devices do tend to sort of contract and rebate and make adjustments to pricing across like particularly in the U.S, given the way DRG's work and different hospitals non-teaching hospitals get different payments than urban hospitals or hospitals here in New York. I'm just wondering if this having RESILIA in a portfolio at a premium, having S3 call it standard or whatever - however you're referring to it in the portfolio? If you're giving any thought to, it's sort of joining the rest of the group to sort of to help some of the smaller centers maybe be able to afford to do TAVR when paying for $30,000 or $32,000 for a round just might be have reached given especially given the way staffing costs have gone up. Love to get your thoughts on that and then I have one quick follow-up?\nMichael Mussallem: Sure. Well, we haven't changed really our pricing philosophy. We do try to be good partners with our hospitals, and we did take a list price increase, but that's the first price increase we've rolled out really since launch. This is the first time that we've gone through a price increase. And so, the other thing that we've always done is, we've always rebated based on volume. So large volume centers, obviously you get discounted out. But we tried to treat everybody fairly across the country by having a standardized price, that's the way that we try to do that. And we try to recognize different centers performance based on their volume and that's been our philosophy throughout. I don't see us changing that philosophy. I think that's worked really well for us and we do try to work with hospitals and bring a lot of value. We still have people supporting virtually every case in the U.S. and the majority of cases in Europe and virtually all the cases in Japan and that's just sort of the model that we have in. And the other thing we try to do is partner with hospitals and run our things like our benchmark program to help them be more efficient, but if you look at all the data that's been produced for our clinical trials, this is an incredibly cost-effective procedure with almost unprecedented benefits when you look at it, mortality and you look at some of the other things that it's done. So we feel the prices that we have are more than fair for the value creation that we have.\nMatt Miksic: That's fair. And then I guess as centers have done more active and staffing does, and pressure starts to ease a little bit, one of the pressure points has been around the extensive imaging and sort of additional sort of staffing -- specialized staffing that's required for some of these mitral procedures, tier procedures. Any thoughts on along the same lines of facilitating broader utilization and adoption through partnering with hospitals, anything that you can see yourself doing to sort of help facilitate those procedures given sort of the specialized staffing needs behind them?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, this is Daveen. I mean, obviously, I think we are always going to look to partner with hospitals, we are going to look to try to help them across the board. We're obviously in our early days, we tried to provide excellent training, top-notch training to get these patients as efficiently and effectively treated getting through the recovery process, et cetera. And I think our teams since a little bit more in the infancy, we don't have the same kind of detailed programs that kind of Larry has, like Benchmark et cetera in the TAVR program, but we're working really hard to try to on the tier side as well start creating those as we start getting more scale and being a great partner. I mean, it's a part of it, we all together Just want to help more patients together in a cost-effective manner. And that's kind of how we think about it over the long-term.\nMatt Miksic: That's fair. And Mike, I have to say it's been something to behold the culture, the accomplishments of the company. Congrats, and you will be missed. Thanks so much.\nMichael Mussallem: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nCecilia Furlong: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to return to Japan, some of the comments that you called out just around competitive trialing, how you would frame Edwards growth there versus the market understanding you. So we're seeing recovery in the region. And then looking-forward to really what's reflected in guidance from Japan recovery at this point as well as Ultra RESILIA rollout?\nMichael Mussallem: Cecilia, this is Mike here, can you just zero-in a little bit on the first part of that question again, I want to make sure that I understand it.\nCecilia Furlong: You talked a bit about competitive dynamics you were seeing in the region, I believe. So just curious if you could provide a little more detail on just how that impacted your growth versus market growth?\nMichael Mussallem: Yes, so we had two other competitors in Japan, both rolled-out new products. And so, it's not uncommon when new products rollout that we see physicians trying those products and understanding how they work and what the features and benefits are and I think we've seen this throughout our history, and usually that ends up being largely transient. And we're excited because we're just getting to our biggest launch that we've done in Japan since our initial launch, which is S3 UR. And so, we're excited about that. I think broader on what's in the guidance for Japan is we're expecting a broader COVID recovery, COVID was still pretty big in Q1 and we're looking for a broader COVID recovery and continued uptake, it got better during the quarter, but we're looking-forward to continue to improve throughout the year and that's what's in our guidance.\nLarry Wood: Yes, the only thing I'd add to it is Japan has been a pretty strong grower for us over the last couple of years and then really slowed down when COVID hit in the second half of last year. So, we're looking-forward here, especially with the launch of -- with the COVID waning and the launch of SAPIEN Ultra RESILIA that it's really going to make a difference starting in Q2 and moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question before turning it over to management for some closing remarks. And that question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. And Mike, really appreciate all your insights on these 92 earnings calls we have been on half of them. But question really, I mean for Larry, just wanted to -- we're getting questions on the TAVR and TAVR replacement cycle. I'm wondering if you could just size up the percentage of the market currently in the TAVR and TAVR represents and imagine it becomes a bigger, more meaningful piece as you get out to 2028 in that $10 billion market that you guys have forecasted, but when should we start to think about TAVR and TAVR contributing more meaningfully to market growth? Thanks for taking the question.\nLarry Wood: Yes, no, it's a good question. I don't know that I can quantify it for you today, but we do TAVR and TAVR, but we also do TAVR and SAVR for patients that have gotten tissue valves, but I think one of the things that TAVR enabled with its development was the opportunity for more patients to get tissue valves. So even on the Surgical side of our business, younger patients can get tissue valves now because physicians and patients now payout let their valves that there is a catheter-based option for them down the road. So certainly, in time TAVR and SAVR will continue to grow and TAVR and TAVR will become a bigger part. TAVR valves now are just probably starting to get to the customer reaching that age that that will start to be more meaningful, but it will be something that grows in time, certainly as we look at the period that you discussed, which is through 2028.\nJoshua Jennings: Appreciate it.\nMichael Mussallem: Okay. Well, this is Mike, I'll make some closing comments. First of all, thank you so much for many of your warm remarks. It's been a special honor and a privilege to lead our team at Edwards Lifesciences for more than 20 years. And I really want to thank our employees who have made immense contributions to advancing care and helping millions of patients around the world. I'm particularly proud of our patients-first culture and our commitment to innovation and excellence. Our success is really a testament to the talented and passionate executive leadership team and our employees worldwide. And I believe we are well-positioned for an even brighter future. It's truly been my greatest honor to be Edwards CEO, and I look forward to supporting Edwards as I transition to my new role with the Board of Directors. So thanks a lot for your continued interest in Edwards and the team will welcome any additional questions after the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that we conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Mussallem",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We're pleased with our first quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations and reflected an improvement in the healthcare staffing along with strong execution of our patient-focused innovation strategy. Sales of $1.46 billion represented 13% growth on a constant-currency basis versus a year-ago period. Strong therapy adoption of transcatheter heart valves drove the majority of growth in the first quarter aided by better-than-expected performance of Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care. By geography, strong growth in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world was partially offset by Japan where COVID impacts lingered. First quarter results in the U.S. were also positively impacted in the quarter by some catch-up in procedure volumes following a seasonal slowdown late last year. While staffing remains a concern at many sites globally, we are optimistic that the environment will continue to improve. In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $948 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew in the low-double-digits versus the prior year, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. As we indicated, we believe that first quarter trends were lifted by improved hospital staffing levels. Results were also lifted by a catch-up in procedure volumes early in the quarter following the holiday season slowdown. We're optimistic about the early results of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA launch in the U.S. As you know, the RESILIA tissues anti-calcification technology has demonstrated a strong track-record of performance in Edwards surgical valves. Adoptions of this advanced technology is proceeding well, and we expect it to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end. TAVR growth in the first quarter was driven by larger volume centers and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance. We're pleased with the continued enrollment of our PROGRESS clinical trials studying patients with moderate AS. Related to this, last month at the ACC Conference data were presented that examined mortality rates in cardiac damage of 600,000 early-stage AS patients in the U.S. This study concluded that all degrees of untreated AS severity were associated with increased mortality risk. Of note, that mean two-year all-cause mortality for moderate AS was approximately 20%, approaching the rate of those with severe AS. Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant-currency TAVR sales grew approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis. Growth reflected positive contributions from all regions, excluding Japan, which was still impacted by COVID and the recent trialing of competitive products. We expect to see higher OUS growth as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations, we were encouraged that conditions improved as the quarter progressed, and we expect COVID headwinds to diminish substantially over the course of 2023. With the launch of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan late last month, we expect growth rates to improve in this country where aortic stenosis remains significantly undertreated relative to other large developed countries. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Total TAVR procedures grew over previous quarters despite persistent disruptions related to hospital staffing shortages. It's encouraging that healthcare systems across Europe are prioritizing lifesaving structural heart therapies including TAVR amidst these challenges. Looking ahead to the EuroPCR Medical Congress next month in Paris, we anticipate additional data from the Edwards benchmark study focusing on strategies to optimize TAVR programs across 28 European centers. Data will also be presented on the outcomes of balloon expandable valves for TAVR in TAVR procedures. In summary, given the strength of our first quarter performance, we now expect constant-currency growth of 10% to 12% versus our previous expectation of 9%to 12%. Our outlook assumes that hospital resource constraints continue to improve during the year. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will increase to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low-double-digits. Turning to TMTT. Our confidence continues to grow in the long-term potential to transform care for the many patients with mitral and tricuspid disease who need better solutions. We remain steadfast on our three key value drivers to unlock this opportunity, developing a portfolio of differentiated therapies for the complex mitral and tricuspid anatomies, driving positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption, and prioritizing favorable real-world clinical outcomes. First quarter sales of $42 million grew substantially, driven by overall tier procedure growth, the ongoing launch and growing adoption of PASCAL Precision in Europe and the initial launch in the United States. We're pleased that we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients and clinician feedback on PASCAL Precision has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system. We are ramping production to support the launches of Europe and the U.S. In Mitral, we look forward to presenting one year data from the full cohort of CLASP IID pivotal trial later this year. Meanwhile, we continue to enroll the CLASP IIF pivotal trial with PASCAL for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, enrollment of ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is ongoing and we anticipate completing enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. We believe that this replacement therapy will expand options for a broader population of mitral patients. In tricuspid, we've completed enrollment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System and remain on-track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and in the U.S., around the end of 2024. The FDA recently approved continued access allowing U.S. hospitals that were involved in the clinical trial to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues enrolling well. In summary, we're pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $170 million to $200 million versus our previous $160 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, better-than-expected first quarter 2023 global sales of $248 million increased a robust 17% on a constant-currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by penetration of our premium products across all regions and valve surgery growth was higher than our expectations as hospital staffing levels improved leading to some catch-up in procedures. We continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. Surgeons and patients value the features and benefits of this proprietary tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. And we've seen adoption of the MITRIS Valve in the US increase in the first quarter. The 7-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons next month. We also began enrollment of our MOMENTIS clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position. In summary, based on our first quarter sales, we are raising our full year sales expectation to the high-end of our $870 million to $970 million guidance range. We now expect high-single-digit underlying growth in 2023, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and an increase in the overall heart valve surgeries. In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $222 million increased 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring our unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Demand for our Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and our HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. Based on the strong first quarter performance, we now expect Critical Care full-year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million versus our previous $840 million to $940 million. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we can to take continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster. And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Thanks so much, Scott. That means a lot and I've truly valued your trusted partnership over the years. It's also a great segue. As part of the upcoming planned CEO succession, Bernard has been serving as President of Edwards Lifesciences since January 1. Since then, we've invested all our time to successfully transition responsibilities and I feel confident passing the baton. Next month, I expect to transition to my new role as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and Bernard will assume the CEO role. I'm excited with the Board's selection of Bernard, and I'm confident that the company is in great hands and will prosper under his proven leadership. But before we go to Q&A, I'll ask Bernard to say a few words. Bernard? Yes, why don't I get started. First of all, thanks so much Larry, that's very meaningful to me. And you're right, we've a long journey together and I really appreciate the support from the investment community. So why don't I turn it over to Bernard and Daveen to sort of answer your questions. Yes, thanks Robbie and I appreciate your comments. Why don't we go to Larry on this one? Yes, thanks for your comments, Vijay. I appreciate that, and I'll give it to Larry. Although, I think he already gave it his best shot, but wanted to see if you have anything to add Larry, right? Yes, thanks, Joanne, and I appreciate your kind comments. Bernard, do you want to take a shot at that? Yes, the other thing I can add, Joanne is that. China is still relatively small on the TAVR front for us. Remember we launched during the COVID years, but Japan is also going to benefit from the launch of the Ultra RESILIA product this year. And so, we think that's going to be a lift for Japan as the year goes on. And that's just launched here this last, this month. Okay. Thanks, Travis. I appreciate that. So, could you repeat your question about the Q1 growth, so I make sure we get it right? Well again, just to try to expand, we typically see pretty fairly extreme seasonality in January where it's our worst month of the quarter. We just didn't see as much extremism, but January was by no means our strongest month. We continue to see a ramp in a quarter, it's just February and March were pretty much in-line with our expectations, but January was stronger, but it wasn't like it was our strongest month, so I hope that gives more context. And I think what we're seeing is the gradual improvement in staffing and I think what we've tried to build into our guidance is we took up the bottom of our range, because we felt we had a strong Q1, but it's kind of in our expectations now to be in that 10% to 12% range globally. Yes, we're very pleased with how the S3 UR rollout has gone. We're really following on in the footsteps of our surgical franchise, and RESILIA, which is on in INSPIRIS and now on MITRIS has become extremely popular with surgeons. And so, we get to follow the legacy that they've really started for us. And we've seen really positive impact from S3 UR. And we expect by the end of the year that that's going to be our leading platform in both the U.S. and Europe. And remember we went for a list price increase with that which is never easy to do and we've been pretty pleased with how that's gone so far and I think that just shows that positions respect and appreciate the value that RESILIA brings to the platform. So we're very encouraged with how the launch has gone to-date. We'll continue to roll it out through the rest of the year, but we do expect it to be our leading platform. I think you had a follow-up question on competitive launches, is that correct? I mean, competitive launches have been going on for a long time, if we look at Europe, there's a whole complement of products out there. And outside of number one and number two, all of the competitors command about probably around 15% of the market and that's been fairly stable. So I think it's for us it's more about us continuing to innovate and rolling out our leading platforms than it is about anything else. Yes, thanks so much for your nice comments, Danielle, it has been a pleasure for me. Why don't I turn this over to Scott to go through your question. Yes, maybe I'll start, and I'll take your second question first, because it might take a couple of to answer your first question. I think we saw the growth being driven more by larger centers than smaller centers during this quarter and I think this is sort of a trend that we've seen throughout COVID. I think when COVID has spiked, we've seen people stay closer to home, we've seen probably more growth in the smaller centers. And as COVID wanes, we see people traveling, maybe a little bit further and going to larger centers. And so, I think this is consistent with trends we've seen over the last year and a half or so. In terms of, when we talk about staffing, it depends when you're talking about our surgical business our TAVR business. When you're talking about the surgical business, it's primarily OR staff and ICU nurses in sort of the post-care initiative. When you're talking about TAVR, there's a lot more that goes into it, because there's a lot more upfront workout. So it requires staffing improvements for CT and for angio and sort of the broader cath lab and we don't need it so much on the after-care side. So - I think we've seen, just generally, and I think hospitals have been working at this for probably better than a year now, trying to get people trained and get people in. I remember, you don't just hire a person and then they're effective from day-one. They have to go through a training process with that hospital, but I would say, generally speaking, you can look at the quarter and say, we saw staffing get better and - that's reflected in our and I think our broad performance. Well, we certainly saw it in TAVR, and we certainly saw with surgical. But it needs to continue to improve over the rest of the year. It's not like we're done yet. And I think hospitals continue to work hard at this maybe I'll ask Daveen to comment on the TMTT side what he saw. Sure. Well, we haven't changed really our pricing philosophy. We do try to be good partners with our hospitals, and we did take a list price increase, but that's the first price increase we've rolled out really since launch. This is the first time that we've gone through a price increase. And so, the other thing that we've always done is, we've always rebated based on volume. So large volume centers, obviously you get discounted out. But we tried to treat everybody fairly across the country by having a standardized price, that's the way that we try to do that. And we try to recognize different centers performance based on their volume and that's been our philosophy throughout. I don't see us changing that philosophy. I think that's worked really well for us and we do try to work with hospitals and bring a lot of value. We still have people supporting virtually every case in the U.S. and the majority of cases in Europe and virtually all the cases in Japan and that's just sort of the model that we have in. And the other thing we try to do is partner with hospitals and run our things like our benchmark program to help them be more efficient, but if you look at all the data that's been produced for our clinical trials, this is an incredibly cost-effective procedure with almost unprecedented benefits when you look at it, mortality and you look at some of the other things that it's done. So we feel the prices that we have are more than fair for the value creation that we have. Thank you, Matt. Cecilia, this is Mike here, can you just zero-in a little bit on the first part of that question again, I want to make sure that I understand it. Yes, so we had two other competitors in Japan, both rolled-out new products. And so, it's not uncommon when new products rollout that we see physicians trying those products and understanding how they work and what the features and benefits are and I think we've seen this throughout our history, and usually that ends up being largely transient. And we're excited because we're just getting to our biggest launch that we've done in Japan since our initial launch, which is S3 UR. And so, we're excited about that. I think broader on what's in the guidance for Japan is we're expecting a broader COVID recovery, COVID was still pretty big in Q1 and we're looking for a broader COVID recovery and continued uptake, it got better during the quarter, but we're looking-forward to continue to improve throughout the year and that's what's in our guidance. Okay. Well, this is Mike, I'll make some closing comments. First of all, thank you so much for many of your warm remarks. It's been a special honor and a privilege to lead our team at Edwards Lifesciences for more than 20 years. And I really want to thank our employees who have made immense contributions to advancing care and helping millions of patients around the world. I'm particularly proud of our patients-first culture and our commitment to innovation and excellence. Our success is really a testament to the talented and passionate executive leadership team and our employees worldwide. And I believe we are well-positioned for an even brighter future. It's truly been my greatest honor to be Edwards CEO, and I look forward to supporting Edwards as I transition to my new role with the Board of Directors. So thanks a lot for your continued interest in Edwards and the team will welcome any additional questions after the call."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Hi, thanks a lot, Mike. We are very pleased by our start to the year. Q1 was particularly strong in January relative to historical seasonality and the rest of the quarter was more consistent with our growth expectations. All product groups performed well, and sales were balanced across all regions with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by lingering COVID headwinds. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.46 billion, which represents 12.6% year-over-year constant-currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.62. Our GAAP EPS was $0.56 and impacted by an intellectual property agreement, which I will speak to later. Contribution from our stronger-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by a higher provision for performance-based compensation. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. For total Edwards, based on the strong start to the year, we now expect 10% to 12% year-over-year sales growth on a constant-currency basis, an increase from our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. We now expect to be at the high-end of our previous range of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. Absent material moves in foreign exchange, we now expect full-year TAVR sales of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion, TMTT sales of $170 million to $200 million and Critical Care sales of $870 million to $940 million. For Surgical Structural Heart, we now expect to be at the high-end of our previous guidance range of $870 million to $970 million. Lastly, we now expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $2.48 and $2.60. We're projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.48 billion and $1.56 billion. We're also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68. I'll now cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.5% as expected, compared to 77.8% in the same period last year and 81% in Q4. This slight year-over-year reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from FX. We continue to expect our full-year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $436 million, or 29.9% of sales, primarily reflecting increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. These investments were partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar. We continue to expect full-year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 14% over the prior year to $261 million, or 17.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full-year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.6%. This rate reflects a 70-basis-point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full-year tax-rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Earlier this month, we were pleased to enter into an intellectual property agreement with Medtronic in which we agreed to a 15-year mutual covenant not to sue with regard to certain structural heart products. We previously had a long-term IP agreement that expired last year. The terms of the new agreement limit what we disclose, but there will be a reference to it in our Form 10-Q, which we will file soon. In consideration for the agreement, we paid Medtronic $300 million, approximately half of which has been recorded as a one-time charge and the other half will be amortized over time. Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 380 percentage points, or $44 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full-year 2023 sales as compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $253 million defined as cash flow from operating activities of $314 million less capital spending of $61 million. We continue to expect full-year 2023 free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $250 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well as pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 5 million shares to 611 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between 610 million and 615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, I'll hand it back to Mike. But before I do, I know everyone on both ends of this call joins me in congratulating you on this your 92nd earnings call. We're now in our 10th year of working together, and it's been a privilege at every step along the way. Your leadership and support as the CEO of Edwards has been an inspiration to me, our employees and I know it's also fair to say the investment community. So with that, Mike, back to you. Yes, so we did end up with higher spending in the first quarter than we had originally budgeted. Our plans for spending for the rest of the year really unchanged. And for the full year, our guidance for SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales are unchanged. In the first quarter, we came in a little bit higher for several reasons. We had some performance-based compensation. It's highly sensitive to sales by design. And so, we'd like to reward people when the topline is performing well. We also had some little things, some onetime one-off expenses for projects we're working on. We had a little bit higher tax rate as a result of income mix that came in U.S. and OUS. So those were some of the special things that you saw flow through in Q1. Yes so Travis, it's Scott. I'll just add to that, our guidance at the midpoint for Q1 was around 9% growth. That was the $1.41 billion. We beat that by $50 million, almost half of that was Surgical, and so we probably were rounded to low double-digits, something like that, if we were to normalize January, but we're getting pretty precise at this point trying to isolate every single month of the quarter. Yes, so I mean the short answer is, we did increase the bottom of our range. So we're expecting 10% to 12%, not 9% to 12%, it's not a huge move, but it does indicate that we had a nice January and we're still positive on the rest of the year. At this point, it's premature to start tinkering any more than that with guidance. We think this is the right modeling assumption for us in that 10% to 12% range for TAVR."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yes, I would also say, obviously, Europe's obviously been the majority of our revenue, but in the U.S. and in Europe we're in launch mode with PASCAL Precision. We've gotten really positive feedback so far from physicians, they love the technology. They see excellent safety and efficacy and we're continuing to grow, we're continuing to open new center, training physicians for the first time and giving exposure to this new great technology. Yes, sure. Thanks Larry, it's Daveen again. I'll jump-in a little bit in our thoughts on TRILUMINATE. Honestly, on TRILUMINATE, we're very pleased to see a high-quality randomized controlled data for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation for the first time. We're excited to see that this trial show that tricuspid tier is not only see but offers significant TR reduction and also offers really meaningful quality-of-life for patients. And I think what we see is that the TRILUMINATE data actually kind of helps confirm outcomes that we've seen in previous PASCAL studies in the tricuspid space like our CLASP TR EFS TriCLASP study, et cetera, that we really see the significant TR reduction great safety and good quality of life. For us, obviously, the CLASP II TR study is ongoing, and maybe I'll give you some more potential on tricuspid tier therapy. But we also believe that you need a toolbox of technologies for tricuspid disease and that not only does tier offer a great solution, but we also think that tricuspid replacement also offers great solutions. Obviously, as the data comes out in the future will help figure out and impact a lot of the questions that you just asked right there, but I think we'll all figure this out together on this journey. Yes I mean. I think it's a similar kind of comment that you made there, probably not the differences where there's a lot of people, a lot of different steps that go into a TMTT case. And again, as Bernard said, we're still a minority player here. But we continue to be optimistic that all those different parts of the fall patient pathway are continuing to get a little bit better in staffing. Yes, this is Daveen. I mean, obviously, I think we are always going to look to partner with hospitals, we are going to look to try to help them across the board. We're obviously in our early days, we tried to provide excellent training, top-notch training to get these patients as efficiently and effectively treated getting through the recovery process, et cetera. And I think our teams since a little bit more in the infancy, we don't have the same kind of detailed programs that kind of Larry has, like Benchmark et cetera in the TAVR program, but we're working really hard to try to on the tier side as well start creating those as we start getting more scale and being a great partner. I mean, it's a part of it, we all together Just want to help more patients together in a cost-effective manner. And that's kind of how we think about it over the long-term."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Yes, thanks Robbie. If I look at the quarter, we typically see a lot of seasonality in January as we come out of the holiday, just kind of refilling up the pipeline we're screening, and we saw a much stronger January than we historically have seen. I mean, we just saw less seasonality. I'd say, February and March, played out pretty much in-line with our expectations. We've anticipated that staffing was going to gradually improve, and I think we see that and I think that's evidenced in the Q1 results, but we expect it to also continue improve throughout the rest of the year. So in terms of trying to judge your backlog, I'm not really, it's hard for us to do that, but we do think there were certainly some catch-up in January. Yes. I don't know if I have a lot more to add from the last question, you know, you'll note we took up the bottom of our range and I think so we tried to reflect all of this in our guidance, but we're just encouraged overall by the staffing trends and where we're going and I think to see TAVR back in double-digit growth after a couple of tough quarters just really I think highlights that the system is getting capacity back and I think that that's a real plus for patients. Yes, well I mean, I think first of all, we're very excited by the surgical growth that we saw in Q1. I think we probably reached probably at an all-time high, that we haven't seen in a long-time. I think that's really a reflection of the innovation and the investments we've made over the last several years, so I think part of this has been the adoption of our premium products and the premium we get and that certainly helps our competitive position and at the same time we did see procedure growth on that happened that I think we results from the capacity, similar to what we saw in TAVR. We saw that capacity improvements on the surgical side of our business as well, but we do get some of the price from our premium products in addition to the growth in the market and then probably a little bit of competitive position as well. So there's probably more drivers on the surgical side than there are on the TAVR side. I mean, volume was certainly a key contributor to it and there's no question about that. So that's a big thing, but again yes there are three things that are contributing to the growth on the surgical business, whereas TAVR it's pretty much primarily units. Yes, the only thing I'd add to it is Japan has been a pretty strong grower for us over the last couple of years and then really slowed down when COVID hit in the second half of last year. So, we're looking-forward here, especially with the launch of -- with the COVID waning and the launch of SAPIEN Ultra RESILIA that it's really going to make a difference starting in Q2 and moving forward. Yes, no, it's a good question. I don't know that I can quantify it for you today, but we do TAVR and TAVR, but we also do TAVR and SAVR for patients that have gotten tissue valves, but I think one of the things that TAVR enabled with its development was the opportunity for more patients to get tissue valves. So even on the Surgical side of our business, younger patients can get tissue valves now because physicians and patients now payout let their valves that there is a catheter-based option for them down the road. So certainly, in time TAVR and SAVR will continue to grow and TAVR and TAVR will become a bigger part. TAVR valves now are just probably starting to get to the customer reaching that age that that will start to be more meaningful, but it will be something that grows in time, certainly as we look at the period that you discussed, which is through 2028."

Bernard?\nBernard Zovighian: [Audio Gap]\u2026of $1.4 billion increase 10% on a constant currency basis versus the year-ago period, slightly ahead of our expectations. TAVR and TMTT both contributed significantly to growth in the third quarter as more patients globally benefited from our catheter-based structural heart therapies. During the quarter, our team made important advancements in our clinical research and new product introduction to address the unmet needs of structural heart patients around the world. Next week at TCT, you will hear more about our commitment to generating important clinical evidence to help physicians and the healthcare ecosystem take care of the many patients in need. At the conference, we will be discussing the pivotal clinical data presentation of early TAVR, TRISCEND II and CLASP IID, along with more than 20 other important updates. Edwards is leading the advancement of science in this large, diverse, and rapidly growing field. Our priority remains positioning TAVR for long-term growth. In addition to introducing differentiated next-gen technologies, we are leading several global initiatives, including reaching more patients through patient awareness, activation and access, and enhancing physician training and support programs. For TMTT, we continue to scale our fast-growing business, and we are pleased with its trajectory over the last several quarters. Key initiatives include broadening the launch of PASCAL, advancing the introduction of EVOQUE in the U.S. and in Europe, and launching SAPIEN M3 in Europe next year. Edwards' unique pipeline of innovation should drive strong multi-year growth. We are also committed to bringing differentiated surgical innovation to patients, supported by strong evidence generation, ensuring we remain at the forefront of surgical advancement. Moreover, we are entering new therapeutic areas, such as aortic regurgitation, or AR, and implantable heart failure management, or IHFM. These initiatives align with our long-term vision of expanding into more therapies, driving sustainable growth for Edwards. It was an especially busy quarter, as our team around the world delivered on our strategy. We closed the sale of Critical Care in September, took important action to sharpen our focus on structural heart, including integrating recent acquisition and right-sizing the company for long-term profitable growth. As we look ahead, we see significant growth opportunities across our differentiated portfolio of leading structural heart therapies for TAVR-AS, TAVR-AR, TMTT, Surgical, and IHFM. This commitment will be discussed in detail at the upcoming investor conference, where we will outline our strategies for differentiated value creation in the years ahead. Now, I will provide details on Q3 results by product group. In TAVR, third quarter global sales of $1 billion increased 6% when adjusted for currency and billing days. Edwards' strong competitive position and pricing remain stable globally, although we experienced a few instances of regional pressure. We are confident in our differentiated technology, high-quality evidence, and the value we continue to demonstrate to patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems. We remain deeply committed to advancing evidence for AS patients. In August, one-year data from the RIA trial, a first-of-its-kind trial focused exclusively on outcomes for women receiving TAVR, were presented at the ESC meeting held in London. Investigators reported superior outcome for women receiving the Edwards SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra Valves as compared to those receiving surgical aortic valve replacement for the primary endpoints of death, stroke, and re-hospitalization at one year. We are proud of this high-quality clinical research. The outstanding success of TAVR points to the importance of valve selection for women undergoing aortic valve replacement, especially those with small annuli, to preserve their option for a future valve-in-valve procedures, ensuring the lifetime management of their disease. Next week at TCT, the clinical community will hear results from the early TAVR trial. The trial is the first and largest randomized controlled trial to-date studying asymptomatic severe AS patients and the impact of early intervention with TAVR. Turning to the U.S., our year-over-year third quarter TAVR sales growth rate was in line with our global TAVR constant currency growth rate. We believe our U.S. competitive position was largely unchanged. In the U.S., although hospitals and physicians continue to acknowledge our team capacity constraint nationally, it is encouraging that many hospitals are exploring additional investments to address future workflow needs to manage these patients. We know from experience that hospitals have historically demonstrated the ability to scale to support trans-catheter procedure growth over time. Outside of the U.S., in the third quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was in line with our global TAVR growth. In Europe, our market position improved sequentially, supported by the continued launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We are pleased with the exceptional patient outcome delivered with this platform, and we expect this momentum to continue as more centers adopt our best-in-class TAVR platform. Additionally, we received CE mark approval for our Alterra system for congenital heart patients. Alterra should result in quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that this younger patient will require over their lifetimes. We have initiated the introduction of this novel therapy in Europe, and initial feedback from clinicians has been positive. In Japan, slower market growth pressured our results. We remain dedicated to expanding this therapy to address significant under-treatment of AS among the substantial elderly population in Japan. In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 TAVR result, which were slightly above our expectation. Our 5% to 7% growth guidance for the full year remains unchanged. However, we expect the Q4 year-over-year sales growth rate to be lower due to some one-time items that Scott will describe later. We remain confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth, driven by our differentiated TAVR technology, our deep commitment to advancing patient care through high-quality clinical evidence, new indication, and our investment in patient activation initiatives. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of JC Medical and JenaValve, early innovators in the treatment of AR. These acquisitions provide an opportunity in a new therapeutic area to address the unmet needs of AR patients around the world, a deadly disease that impacts more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. alone, and is largely untreated today. As the pioneer in valve innovation, we believe Edwards is best positioned to develop, study, and deliver novel technologies. I am pleased to report that we performed our first implant in the Journey pivotal trial with the Edwards J-Valve AR system, recently acquired from JC Medical. As noted in our announcement of the JenaValve transaction, the acquisition is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We are responding to a second request from the FTC in connection with their review and anticipate closing the acquisition mid-2025. Now turning to TMTT, our unique innovations, including the PASCAL repair system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system, and the upcoming SAPIEN 3 mitral replacement system, provide a broad set of treatment options to serve the many diverse and complex patients in need. We are pleased with the Q3 result, achieving 91 million in sales, representing 74% growth over the prior year. Sales were led by PASCAL growth globally, we continue the initial commercial expansion of EVOQUE in the U.S. and Europe. Globally, we continue to see more patients diagnosed and treated as long as strong therapy adoption, resulting in mitral procedures experiencing ongoing double-digit growth and even stronger tricuspid therapy growth. Adoption of a differentiated PASCAL technology is expanding in both new and existing sites around the world. We look forward to presenting the two-year outcomes of a CLASP IID pivotal trial studying DMR patients at TCT next week. We are also pleased to announce the earlier than expected completion of enrollment for the CLASP IITR trial studying TR patients with PASCAL randomized against optimal medical therapy alone. This achievement is great news for patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation given the differentiated characteristic of PASCAL. The EVOQUE launch continues to progress well as we successfully activate new sites in both the U.S. and Europe beyond our initial trial centers. We are also increasing our field teams to deliver on our high-touch model to support new sites as we bring EVOQUE into their clinical practice in order to achieve excellent patient outcomes. The strong interest in this therapy continues to highlight the large unmet need. The full 400 patient cohort of a TRISCEND II pivotal study at one year will also be presented at TCT next week. In our continued efforts to reach more patients, a fourth and larger size EVOQUE valve, the 56 millimeter, was recently approved in the U.S. The addition of this larger valve size will expand the addressable patient population. On October 1, EVOQUE became eligible for Medicare's new technology add-on payment. This additional payment above standard reimbursement is in effect for three years and will support increased access to this breakthrough therapy for the many U.S. patients in need. Based on the ongoing global adoption of our two therapies, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we remain confident in our full year full year TMTT self-guidance at the high end of 320 million to 340 million. In surgical, third quarter sales from continuing operation of $240 million increased 5% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS, and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients best treated surgically, including those undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence and enrollment in Europe for a momentous clinical trial studying MITRIS is ahead of schedule. In addition, a comments AR manuscript has been published in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, which shows positive outcome for patients with AR treated with RESILIA tissue valve after five years. Finally, two investigator-initiated registries out of Europe, Endure and Impact, have shown favorable outcome in younger and more complex patients who were implanted with the RESILIA INSPIRIS valve. In summary, we continue to believe that our full year 2024 surgical sales growth will be 6% to 8%. Turning to structural heart failure, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Endotronix, marking our entry into implantable heart failure management, or IHFM. Our vision for IHFM is consistent with our other structural heart technologies to establish a platform that ensures best-in-class outcome for patients in need, resulting in multi-years of growth. We released strong 12-month results from the proactive HF pivotal trial at the HFSA conference, which demonstrated significant benefit to patients managed with the Cordella system, an implantable pulmonary artery pressure sensor allowing early targeted heart failure intervention. In addition, the proactive HF2 trial has also been initiated, which will extend the evidence base for implantable heart failure management and further demonstrate the value of data-driven heart failure management. With the recent approval of Cordella in the U.S. and the completion of our first cases, our focus is on building our commercial team, deploying physician training, case support to ensure high quality of outcomes. Revenue will ramp over time as we focus on discipline, commercialization, outcome, system usage, and patient engagement. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Bernard. We were pleased with our financial results in the third quarter, starting with third quarter sales from continuing operations of $1.35 billion. Our continuing operations underlying sales growth was 9.6%, and Edwards adjusted earnings per share was $0.67, both slightly ahead of what we modeled for Q3 guidance provided in July. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations is included with today's press release. The sale of critical care, as well as the acquisitions we announced last month, resulted in some new features in the presentation of our financial results this quarter. First, it's important to note that our original sales guidance for Q3 assumed we would own critical care for all of Q3. We were pleased to close the sale of critical care in early September, so we did not have critical care sales in the last month of Q3. Second, the discontinued operations in today's release and the 10-Q that we will file in early November are comprised of the two components that represent our plan to exit product groups that are not focused on implantable medical innovations for structural heart disease. The discontinued operations includes critical care, as well as a small, non-core product group that reduces the reported sales of surgical structural heart. Third, as it relates to previously announced acquisitions, we do not expect meaningful contribution to Edwards sales in 2024 and 2025. The additional operating expense from three of the four acquisitions announced is included in our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance. Additionally, there is a new line of the profit and loss statement above operating income called other operating expense and income, reflecting an impact related to critical care transition service agreements. So now I'll cover additional details of our continuing operations P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was elevated at 80.7%, slightly higher year-over-year and sequentially due to variable expense timing. We expect fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with the high end of our 76% to 78% full year guidance range, which is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the quarter were $421 million or 31.1% of sales compared to $382 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of field-based personnel to support growth of our transcatheter therapies, including the launch and rollout of Pascal and Evoke. Research and development expenses in the third quarter grew 4% over the prior year to $253 million or 18.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. Adjusted operating profit margin in Q3 was elevated at 31.4%, reflecting unusual benefits of variable expense timing. We expect Q4 adjusted operating margin to decline to the mid-20s, resulting in full year 2024 average adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 27% to 28%, which is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025, with forecasts for expanding margin thereafter. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.1% or adjusted 12.4%. We expect a similar adjusted tax rate in Q4. As a reminder, our original 2024 adjusted tax rate guidance range was 14% to 17%, and we are benefiting this year from several one-time tax events, resulting in a lower than originally expected rate. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter adjusted sales growth by 70 basis points, or $7.9 million compared to the prior year. GAAP earnings per share of $5.13 reflects the one-time gain on the sale of critical care. Also unique to this quarter were several special items, including a restructuring charge, a gain on our original investment in Endotronix, and a $30 million charitable donation to support the work of the Edwards Life Sciences Foundation. Turning to the balance sheet, following the critical care sale, we had approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30. You'll see a balance sheet in our 10-Q filing in early November. During the third quarter, the company repurchased $1 billion of stock through a combination of pre-established trading plans and accelerated share repurchase programs. Edwards currently has approximately $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Based on our year-to-date share repurchase activity, we expect average diluted shares outstanding for Q4 2024 to be between 590 million and 595 million. I'll finish with comments related to guidance. Our full year guidance for Edwards sales growth of 8% to 10% remains unchanged, as does our guidance for our three product groups. Our guidance assumes fourth quarter year-over-year TAVR growth below the full year TAVR range of 5% to 7%. Recall, Q4 of 2023 was an especially strong quarter for TAVR. In Q4 of this year, we have seen impact from the hurricanes in the southeast, as well as a one-time impact from a China distributor rebate adjustment, and fewer selling days versus Q3. It's important to note that our daily TAVR procedure volume is still forecasted to be sequentially higher in Q4 versus Q3. We expect Q4 sales of $1.33 billion to $1.39 billion and Q4 earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.57. We look forward to providing detailed 2025 financial guidance at our investor conference in New York on December 4th. And with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. We are confident that our innovative therapy will allow Edwards to treat more patients around the world and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefit of breakthrough technologies, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Bernard. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue, and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Please refrain from asking questions related to our Early TAVR or TRISCEND II pivotal trials. We will present data on those trials next week at TCT and host investor briefings on both Monday and on Wednesday after the presentation to discuss the results in more detail. We really hope to see you there. Diego, please go ahead with additional details on how participants can access the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, I guess maybe help us bridge the Q4 guidance implies about $2.20 on an annual basis, just using the midpoint times four. Can you bridge from the prior guidance of $2.75 at the midpoint? Did it only change for Critical Care, which we thought was always going to be $0.40 diluted? Seems like something else changed, and I had one follow-up.\nScott Ullem: Yes, thanks for the question, Larry. There are a couple of things that changed. One was the elimination of Critical Care, which on a full-year basis would have impacted earnings per share to the tune of about $0.35. We're also picking up in the fourth quarter some additional expense related to three of the four acquisitions that we announced earlier, which hit us in Q4. Q4 does not reflect some of the benefits of the right sizing that we conducted earlier and that we will see in 2025.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful, Scott. And then just a follow-up on that. Sorry.\nBernard Zovighian: No, just to add on what Scott said, Larry, obviously we are also expecting growth from our continued operation in 2025 together with the EPS leverage. And we will provide a full guidance during investor conference in December.\nLarry Biegelsen: Okay. I mean, that was my follow-up, Scott. I mean, I know you anticipated the question. Just using that kind of Q4 EPS of $0.55 at the midpoint, people are going to multiply and get to $2.20. How should we think about that in the context of 2025 EPS? You gave some helpful color on the operating margin. Is there anything else we should consider when we're trying to kind of model 2025 here?\nScott Ullem: Yes. Obviously, the big driver is top-line growth, and we'll be prepared to talk about that for Edwards and for different product lines on December 4. And you're right, we tried to give you some building blocks for margins, both operating margin. We talked about the special tax rate benefits we achieved in 2024, which we're not going to model achieving in 2025. And as Bernard just mentioned, we're going to see benefits from some of the actions we've taken this year when we hit the full year 2025. So, those are the different moving pieces that we can give you for now, and we'll take you through the top-line impact in December.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Scott, maybe if I could go back to this Q4 guidance assumptions, I think you called out a few line items on TAVR between the hurricane, China. Could you parse out what the impact of hurricane, I'm assuming we've already seen some impact, and what was China? Is this just one timer on China? Could there be some lingering impact as we think about next year? And based, I know you said lesser days versus third quarter, but on a year-on-year basis, any change in number of days in Q4?\nScott Ullem: Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. First on China, this is a one-time adjustment to a rebate for a distributor in China. It does not have anything to do with our operations or our sales growth in China at this point. As it relates to selling days, yes, there are three fewer selling days in Q4 than there were in Q3, and that impacts us when we start talking about sales dollars. But what's important to know and remember is the procedure volume on an average daily basis is growing sequentially in Q4 over Q3.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then maybe one more related to the guidance here. What is the implied operating margins here for Q4, right, when you look at the DPS and the revenue sales dollars? Is that something like mid-25s? And I'm just trying to think, what is the right run rate here on operating margins as you get the benefit from right-sizing expense line item? And sorry, back on the days, on a year-on-year basis, was it consistent, or did the year-on-year basis change?\nScott Ullem: Well, I understood the first part of your question. Let me answer it, and then maybe you can help me on the second part of the question. So, yes, for Q4, the guidance assumes mid-20s or implies mid-20s percentage operating margin. For next year, we expect that to grow to the range of 27% to 28%, which is also the same as our full-year 2024 operating margin. And help me with the other piece of your question, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry, on the days, fourth quarter days versus fourth quarter \u201823, I was looking on a year-on-year basis on the days common.\nScott Ullem: I believe the selling days were comparable or the same in Q4 of 2023 as in 2024. We'll check that, and I'll come back on if that's not right.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll switch it over to some of the products. TMTT, again, came in better than expected. We've seen from your competitor a nice quarter on the repair side. I was wondering if you could talk about, on tricuspid repair specifically, I was wondering if you could talk about your tricuspid replacement and how you're seeing doctors choose in the market which patients are appropriate for which and the decision-making process.\nDaveen Chopra: No. Hey, thanks, Robbie. This is Daveen. Appreciate the question. Maybe I'll just start off with a couple overall comments on EVOQUE. Obviously, we've been very pleased so far with the introduction of EVOQUE in both the U.S. and in Europe. We've really seen strong physician and patient demand, which really enforces that there's a lot of unmet needs for these patients. And we've loved to see so far with EVOQUE that we've got very predictable times that are very similar to the clinical trial - that are very similar from both clinical trial sites as well as new sites. And clinical outcomes are very much similar to TRISCEND II. And we also have seen in the U.S. where we just have EVOQUE that from our experience in Europe where we have both repair and replacement, we see that it's important to have a portfolio of both repair and replacement technologies to really treat the diversity of these complex patients that are tricuspid patients. And so right now, we're continuing to open up new centers, activating new sites, focusing on other big tricuspid centers, really with robust training and high clinical support. And we're continuing to add to our clinical kind of support training team. Specifically to your question about repair and replacement, I think we're all still figuring that out about who's the right patient for each. We see that there may be some anatomical considerations where one may be better for than another. But I think as a world, we're still all trying to figure this out. But we really do believe that you need both technologies to really see, to really see, to treat the most number of patients. Two other quick comments are, obviously over time, we believe that EVOQUE in our portfolio, now if you pull back up and look at TMTD, EVOQUE's going to become a larger and larger percent of our portfolio. But right now, PASCAL is still our largest growth driver on a year-on-year basis just because it's a more established base and a larger base overall. But we look exciting to treating more and more patients with both EVOQUE and PASCAL.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, on TAVR, you've now had three more months to kind of evaluate the market and really dig into the capacity issue. And I'm asking this more from a market perspective because none of your competitors kind of validated a capacity issue. And so when you see it, I imagine that, you're one of the biggest in the structural heart lab, so I imagine you probably have the best view. But how are you thinking about capacity here? Is it more of a TAVR volume issue versus capacity? I know the market is still substantial from a top-down basis, just because we don't hear anybody else kind of validating the capacity. So I'd love to get your thoughts there on what you're seeing on the ground. Thanks a lot.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Thanks, Robbie. This is Larry. Yes, it's something we spend a lot of time on in the quarter. We spend a lot of time with hospital administrators and with our physicians in the field. And I think one of the things to just think about is, given our market position overall, we're more dependent on market growth than any of our competitors are. For people that are coming off small bases, if they pick up a little bit of share or a few cases here and there, they don't really necessarily see the capacity constraints in the same way. I also think, you just have to look at all of the new technology in the last couple of years that's coming to the Cath Lab space. And frankly, we're part of the problem. As Daveen's growing and bringing in new products like EVOQUE, and we see continued adoption of PASCAL, and you see adoption of other technologies, it's just putting tremendous pressure on the structural heart teams to be able to prioritize patients and to move patients around. Now, we've been very encouraged in our discussions with administrators that, they see this as being a long-term growth part of their hospital systems, which means they now, I think, are starting to realize just not that they're going to have to add some capacity, but they're just not going to be able to move resources around to be able to address the patient needs. So we have heard of hospitals that are now specifically investing in their structural heart space so that you can meet these needs. But it's a little bit different by hospital. There's some places that maybe the constraints are a little bit more physical constraints with rooms than in other places. It's more just a staffing issue, and they can prioritize it. But one of the reasons we brought together a lot of administrators is so that they could share best practices for how they're trying to manage all of the challenges that they have and try to move that forward. And we'll continue to do that, until this gets resolved. But that's kind of an update on where we are. But one thing I will stress is, it's not a shortage of patients. I think we do see backlogs growing. We say time to treat is increasing for our TAVR patients. And that's just the other issue that we have to address because we know these patients don't wait well. Bernard, do you have anything to add just as a broader company?\nBernard Zovighian: No, no. I think you said it all and well, Larry. We are part of the issue here. We are such an innovator in the space with PASCAL, with EVOQUE, with TAVR. We have a market-leading position in TAVR. And you need to realize also that when we bring in EVOQUE in one of the larger TAVR centers, it is taking, it is needing a lot of resource. We want to make it, TR is a new disease. So the health basically, this heart team is learning about the new disease, is training about the new device. We are, then they are screening patients. So it's not like, one day kind of adjusting their workflow. It is taking multiple days, weeks, but we are very confident that they are patients, tricuspid patient, mitral patient, AS patient. We are bringing innovative technologies. The healthcare system have proven to us in the past, they know how to scale and all of these procedures are profitable. So we are confident that yes, it is an issue right now. We don't believe that it is a long-term issue, which is not going to take a few weeks to solve, but it is not going to take a few years to solve also.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nDavid Roman: I wanted to start on just laying out some of the pieces here post TCT. And I appreciate that we won't see the data until next week. But as you think about the subsequent activities that would take place either on the asymptomatic patient population as it relates to label expansion or additional patient activation efforts, what happens next there? And maybe you can kind of talk through some of the dynamics on the tricuspid side as well, appreciating here that the FDA has already approved EVOQUE, and NCD is already underway, and you have the NTAP to support adoption. But maybe help us think about the activities that happen subsequent to TCT, and then when we should realistically expect to see a benefit of that flow through the business assuming positive outcomes in these studies?\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, David, for the question. Anything related to TCT, I suggest we wait until next week, what we did in the next week to make sure we can go very deep with you. We have an event on Monday, and we have even Wednesday, after the 2 presentations. So we will go deep then, and we are also going deep at investor conference. Now with regards to the NCD for EVOQUE, maybe you want to touch on that, Daveen?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes. No problem at all. Yes. Right now, we are obviously in a national coverage analysis position where CMS is working along their pathway and through their work where we expect to see a draft NCD hopefully come out by year-end, and we hope to have an NCD in place by the end of Q1. And we're fully supportive of CMS's efforts to get this out as quickly as possible to support patients.\nDavid Roman: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the P&L here and understanding that we'll get the guidance in December. But the 27% to 28% operating margin as a starting point implies kind of flattish year-over-year. So is conceptually the right way to think about that, Scott, that the actions you've taken here to right-size the company effectively help you fund the incremental investments associated with the acquired assets, and that that forms a new base of operating margin off of which we can see expansion longer term? And then maybe just, Daveen, to clarify, can you just describe the interplay between the NCD and the NTAP post Q1 of next year?\nScott Ullem: Well, I'll start. And you said it perfectly, David, yes, 27% to 28% implies the impact of the acquisitions and the rightsizing moves that we made this year. And it is a base off of which we will grow. And our plan is that we're going to continue to expand operating margins after we get through 2025. Daveen?\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, sure. So the NTAP, which started October 1 is about incremental payment above the existing DRG. So a hospital center, depending on their cost structure and it's very center-dependent, can get incremental payment when they do an EVOQUE case for Medicare for that case. The NCD is about coverage meaning which patients are covered or not to get the payment. So the NCD and what is written in the NCD will help determine which patients and which centers do EVOQUE, and which patients would get reimbursed. The NTAP helps increase the amount of payment for each patient when they do a case.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nTravis Steed: I just wanted to clarify the 27% to 28% op margin. That includes the JenaValve the deal that hasn't closed and includes kind of everything, the cost savings? And it seems like that's like $240 million, $250 million in earnings range. I don't know if there's a floor or you'd like to comment on that for the EPS side?\nScott Ullem: So the 27% to 28% includes 3 of the 4 acquisitions. We're not being very specific about what the implications would be for Jena. As we mentioned, we're responding to questions that we've received, and we're expecting that we'll get that that closed next year. As it relates to earnings per share, yes, let's not go there. I don't really want to get overly specific about what that looks like, again, because we want to paint the full picture, including top line growth when we get to the investor conference in December.\nTravis Steed: That's fair. I don't know if there's any way to quantify the JenaValve addition on that 27% to 28% op margin, but that's going to be the follow-up. But the other question I was going to ask was, the 5% to 7% TAVR growth that you've kind of been at this year, is that the way to think about kind of your ongoing steady state? Or do you think there's kind of catalyst that could reaccelerate that going forward? Just trying to think about like bigger picture how you're thinking about the TAVR opportunity for Edwards.\nScott Ullem: Yes. Travis, we're thinking about it really positively. We've got a lot of positive catalysts for TAVR. And at the same time, it's just premature to start talking about what the growth rates look like. We're excited to lay it all out for you when we get to December.\nBernard Zovighian: Maybe adding a general comment about profitability and all these kind of things. As you have seen in Q3, we took action to optimize the company. We are looking very seriously at, in a very thoughtful fashion, about cost optimization, resource allocation. So what we want to deliver is sustainable, healthy, profitable growth for the years to come as a company. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nMatt Taylor: So I want to ask about the results, but I just want to ask about the timing of impact. If these trials are positive next week, how quickly do you think you could see some positive lift on TAVR and/or TMTT from early TAVR and the tricuspid results?\nBernard Zovighian: Matt, thanks for the question. Again, look, we are going to discuss this in full detail on Monday. It is a little bit not easy for us to discuss before Monday. The trial is embargo, it is a blinded study. We cannot go there right now. But for sure, on Monday, please attend the event and also at the investor conference. Larry is going to talk about TAVR.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Please state your question.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks so much for taking the question and for the color on 2025. I just wanted to maybe ask Scott, I'm not sure if I missed it, but I appreciate the color on the operating margin. Wondering if, at this stage, you're ready to say anything about the gross margin, FX related or otherwise.\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Yes. I think for gross margin, we're expecting in the fourth quarter that we'll be back to the high end of our original guidance range of 76% to 78%. And that high end of 76% to 78% is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025. Obviously, there's a lot that can change between now and then. We got foreign exchange running through there. But at this point, that's as much as we can do to help you out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please state your question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much for taking the question. I'll put them both at the front. Can you quantify the one-time impacts for the fourth quarter for TAVR? It seems like that's causing a little bit of confusion as people are thinking about how that's progressing sequentially. And then my second question has to do with products. I haven't heard you here or talk about for M3 for mitral replacement in a while. And I don't know if you can just give a little bit of update on the timing of that or when we might see anything incremental.\nScott Ullem: Joanne, thanks for the question. On the first one, the specific impact that we know is relating to the China distributor adjustment, which is about $5 million. The other items that we mentioned are not something that we're ready to quantify at this point. Obviously, we'll talk about everything that happened in the quarter once we finished the quarter, but that's the one number that we can give you right now.\nDaveen Chopra: Great. And a follow-up question you had, Joanne, just on about M3. No, we still continue to be excited about SAPIEN M3. This is the first transfemoral sub-30 French mitral valve replacement system, and it's really built off SAPIEN, which we know has been put in thousands of different mitral positions. So right now for Europe, last quarter, we announced we continue to anticipate European launch in mid-2025, and we would have the U.S. at some point after. Specifically related to the U.S., we are in the 1-year follow-up period this year of the M3, and then it takes some time obviously to put the data together, get the PMA in and then there as a standard kind of FDA timeline review whether there's a panel or not. But we continue to be excited about SAPIEN M3. But Larry had a comment too, yes.\nLarry Wood: Just a follow-up on Scott's comment, Joanne. We can't exactly quantify the hurricane in the IV solution issue. We know that we were impacted with cases early in the quarter. But I think that that's also behind us. And I don't expect this to be a lingering thing throughout the quarter. And as Scott said previously, we are anticipating our average daily cases to be increasing Q4 over Q3. So I don't want to overstate the impact of these one-timer things when you look at it in the bigger picture.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please state your question.\nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a good quarter, considering everything. Just a quick question on how we should think about the competitive dynamics. And particularly in the U.S., we'll see some competitive data next week, might see a fourth valve come to market. Would love to hear, appreciate you guys have said today, your share is stable, but how you're thinking about the future? And even the receptivity so far with 3 valves of centers for taking on a third valve, who's losing share to that third valve? And also the pricing dynamic. Sorry, that was a lot, but that's my only question.\nLarry Wood: Danielle, maybe I'll start, and then I'll let Bernard comment on just kind of broader company aspects. Yes, we do charge a premium for our platform. We believe our S3 UR represents absolute best-in-class technology and best-in-class performance. It takes all of the things that we've always loved about SAPIEN 3 Ultra but added our RESILIA tissue which we have a deep history with from our surgical business. So we think our platform deserves the premium that we charge globally. I think we always think carefully about competition. We have deep respect for our competitors. But I think when you look at the body of evidence that we've put on the table through our clinical trials, you look at things like PARTNER 3, 99% of our patients were alive and well at a year. You look at 5 years, 90% of our patients were still alive. We think that the technology but also the clinical evidence support our best-in-class premise. But it's our responsibility and it's our job to make sure we're always communicating that with our customers. And it's not just about the price of the device, it's the value we bring to their system. And we just simply think that we offer the best there is in lifetime management of these patients and also running a very efficient TAVR program in terms of procedure time and predictability and discharge. But it's our job to continue to make that case, and I think it's about us being able to do that and execute at a high level.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So if I look at the entire company, I look at, for instance, surgical, 65 years of pioneering innovation. Today, we are, by far, a global leader in premium pricing. Our valve, surgical valve, are the best valves. When I look at TAVR, we are the global leader with a premium pricing, and it is the valve, our TAVR valve is the valve of choice. If you look at what we are doing with EVOQUE, again, we are a pioneer again, creating category leading the space. We bring value to the entire health care ecosystem. So one is we are proud about our history. We like our strategy. It's working. What we are bringing is breakthrough technologies, bringing value to patients and all stakeholders. We know that competition is coming, and it has been there for many years. The structural heart is a large space. There are many patients. It is growing. It is attracting a lot of competitors. But we like our position. We like our technology. We like our strategy. And there are more patients to treat in surgical, in TAVR, in TMTT, in heart failure. And this is why we are so confident in us being able to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in the many years to come. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nPatrick Wood: Beautiful. Thank you. I just had one quick one to follow up on that, which was for TAVR. I can get a sense, but could you maybe give us a sense of how you're seeing growth in some of the larger centers relative to the smaller? I'm thinking about the commentary about where EVOQUE and PASCAL have been rolling out and the disruption from that. So for the smaller programs, have you seen a different kind of growth profile than what you've seen in the larger?\nLarry Wood: Yes. This is Larry. That sort of moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I will say that the larger academic programs are the ones that are most likely to be adopting the new therapies and really putting more focus, and those are oftentimes places that are closer to their capacity wall. So we maybe see a little bit of impact in those larger academic programs that are kind of on the forefront of utilizing these new technologies. But it's hard to generalize. We have probably close to 850 centers in the U.S. And to a degree, they all have different challenges. But broadly speaking, I think the large academic centers were the early adopters is probably where we feel a significant amount of the pressure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.\nAdam Maeder: I'll keep it to one. I wanted to ask about EVOQUE and specifically the NTAP that went into effect on October 1. I'm just wondering if you've seen any kind of noticeable impact to uptake in the past couple of weeks. How do you think about the impact of improved reimbursement going forward? And then the second part of the question is just on the 56-millimeter valve size, now that that's FDA approved, just curious how big of a patient population does that valve size serve?\nDaveen Chopra: No, I appreciate the question, Adam. So talking a little bit first about the NTAP and EVOQUE. Obviously, I think the incremental reimbursement obviously provides a tailwind to people wanting to use EVOQUE. There were some centers who were maybe holding off a little bit or taking a little bit more time to get the EVOQUE training curve leading up to NTAP, then they're waiting for NTAP to get on board. But that being said, we're still just seeing such strong demand across the board from different centers to open up new centers that I think it provides a little bit catalyst, but we just have consistent demand from centers. We haven't got a chance to open up yet across the board. So that's probably a comment on NTAP. Specifically on the 56, we're excited with the 56 approval at that fourth size, now larger size on. We don't have perfect data but based on what we've seen from previously screened patients, it maybe adds 20% or 25% applicability to the overall pool. So we're glad to have the size available for those patients who need it.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have run out of time for questions at this point. So I will now hand the floor back to Bernard Zovighian for closing remarks. Thank you.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. No, thank you for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark, and myself welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thank you, everyone. And see you next week at TCT.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day. Thank you.",

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Robbie. This is Larry. Yes, it's something we spend a lot of time on in the quarter. We spend a lot of time with hospital administrators and with our physicians in the field. And I think one of the things to just think about is, given our market position overall, we're more dependent on market growth than any of our competitors are. For people that are coming off small bases, if they pick up a little bit of share or a few cases here and there, they don't really necessarily see the capacity constraints in the same way. I also think, you just have to look at all of the new technology in the last couple of years that's coming to the Cath Lab space. And frankly, we're part of the problem. As Daveen's growing and bringing in new products like EVOQUE, and we see continued adoption of PASCAL, and you see adoption of other technologies, it's just putting tremendous pressure on the structural heart teams to be able to prioritize patients and to move patients around. Now, we've been very encouraged in our discussions with administrators that, they see this as being a long-term growth part of their hospital systems, which means they now, I think, are starting to realize just not that they're going to have to add some capacity, but they're just not going to be able to move resources around to be able to address the patient needs. So we have heard of hospitals that are now specifically investing in their structural heart space so that you can meet these needs. But it's a little bit different by hospital. There's some places that maybe the constraints are a little bit more physical constraints with rooms than in other places. It's more just a staffing issue, and they can prioritize it. But one of the reasons we brought together a lot of administrators is so that they could share best practices for how they're trying to manage all of the challenges that they have and try to move that forward. And we'll continue to do that, until this gets resolved. But that's kind of an update on where we are. But one thing I will stress is, it's not a shortage of patients. I think we do see backlogs growing. We say time to treat is increasing for our TAVR patients. And that's just the other issue that we have to address because we know these patients don't wait well. Bernard, do you have anything to add just as a broader company? Just a follow-up on Scott's comment, Joanne. We can't exactly quantify the hurricane in the IV solution issue. We know that we were impacted with cases early in the quarter. But I think that that's also behind us. And I don't expect this to be a lingering thing throughout the quarter. And as Scott said previously, we are anticipating our average daily cases to be increasing Q4 over Q3. So I don't want to overstate the impact of these one-timer things when you look at it in the bigger picture. Danielle, maybe I'll start, and then I'll let Bernard comment on just kind of broader company aspects. Yes, we do charge a premium for our platform. We believe our S3 UR represents absolute best-in-class technology and best-in-class performance. It takes all of the things that we've always loved about SAPIEN 3 Ultra but added our RESILIA tissue which we have a deep history with from our surgical business. So we think our platform deserves the premium that we charge globally. I think we always think carefully about competition. We have deep respect for our competitors. But I think when you look at the body of evidence that we've put on the table through our clinical trials, you look at things like PARTNER 3, 99% of our patients were alive and well at a year. You look at 5 years, 90% of our patients were still alive. We think that the technology but also the clinical evidence support our best-in-class premise. But it's our responsibility and it's our job to make sure we're always communicating that with our customers. And it's not just about the price of the device, it's the value we bring to their system. And we just simply think that we offer the best there is in lifetime management of these patients and also running a very efficient TAVR program in terms of procedure time and predictability and discharge. But it's our job to continue to make that case, and I think it's about us being able to do that and execute at a high level. Yes. This is Larry. That sort of moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I will say that the larger academic programs are the ones that are most likely to be adopting the new therapies and really putting more focus, and those are oftentimes places that are closer to their capacity wall. So we maybe see a little bit of impact in those larger academic programs that are kind of on the forefront of utilizing these new technologies. But it's hard to generalize. We have probably close to 850 centers in the U.S. And to a degree, they all have different challenges. But broadly speaking, I think the large academic centers were the early adopters is probably where we feel a significant amount of the pressure."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Bernard. We were pleased with our financial results in the third quarter, starting with third quarter sales from continuing operations of $1.35 billion. Our continuing operations underlying sales growth was 9.6%, and Edwards adjusted earnings per share was $0.67, both slightly ahead of what we modeled for Q3 guidance provided in July. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations is included with today's press release. The sale of critical care, as well as the acquisitions we announced last month, resulted in some new features in the presentation of our financial results this quarter. First, it's important to note that our original sales guidance for Q3 assumed we would own critical care for all of Q3. We were pleased to close the sale of critical care in early September, so we did not have critical care sales in the last month of Q3. Second, the discontinued operations in today's release and the 10-Q that we will file in early November are comprised of the two components that represent our plan to exit product groups that are not focused on implantable medical innovations for structural heart disease. The discontinued operations includes critical care, as well as a small, non-core product group that reduces the reported sales of surgical structural heart. Third, as it relates to previously announced acquisitions, we do not expect meaningful contribution to Edwards sales in 2024 and 2025. The additional operating expense from three of the four acquisitions announced is included in our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance. Additionally, there is a new line of the profit and loss statement above operating income called other operating expense and income, reflecting an impact related to critical care transition service agreements. So now I'll cover additional details of our continuing operations P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was elevated at 80.7%, slightly higher year-over-year and sequentially due to variable expense timing. We expect fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with the high end of our 76% to 78% full year guidance range, which is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the quarter were $421 million or 31.1% of sales compared to $382 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of field-based personnel to support growth of our transcatheter therapies, including the launch and rollout of Pascal and Evoke. Research and development expenses in the third quarter grew 4% over the prior year to $253 million or 18.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. Adjusted operating profit margin in Q3 was elevated at 31.4%, reflecting unusual benefits of variable expense timing. We expect Q4 adjusted operating margin to decline to the mid-20s, resulting in full year 2024 average adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 27% to 28%, which is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025, with forecasts for expanding margin thereafter. Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.1% or adjusted 12.4%. We expect a similar adjusted tax rate in Q4. As a reminder, our original 2024 adjusted tax rate guidance range was 14% to 17%, and we are benefiting this year from several one-time tax events, resulting in a lower than originally expected rate. Foreign exchange rates decreased third quarter adjusted sales growth by 70 basis points, or $7.9 million compared to the prior year. GAAP earnings per share of $5.13 reflects the one-time gain on the sale of critical care. Also unique to this quarter were several special items, including a restructuring charge, a gain on our original investment in Endotronix, and a $30 million charitable donation to support the work of the Edwards Life Sciences Foundation. Turning to the balance sheet, following the critical care sale, we had approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30. You'll see a balance sheet in our 10-Q filing in early November. During the third quarter, the company repurchased $1 billion of stock through a combination of pre-established trading plans and accelerated share repurchase programs. Edwards currently has approximately $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Based on our year-to-date share repurchase activity, we expect average diluted shares outstanding for Q4 2024 to be between 590 million and 595 million. I'll finish with comments related to guidance. Our full year guidance for Edwards sales growth of 8% to 10% remains unchanged, as does our guidance for our three product groups. Our guidance assumes fourth quarter year-over-year TAVR growth below the full year TAVR range of 5% to 7%. Recall, Q4 of 2023 was an especially strong quarter for TAVR. In Q4 of this year, we have seen impact from the hurricanes in the southeast, as well as a one-time impact from a China distributor rebate adjustment, and fewer selling days versus Q3. It's important to note that our daily TAVR procedure volume is still forecasted to be sequentially higher in Q4 versus Q3. We expect Q4 sales of $1.33 billion to $1.39 billion and Q4 earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.57. We look forward to providing detailed 2025 financial guidance at our investor conference in New York on December 4th. And with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard. Yes, thanks for the question, Larry. There are a couple of things that changed. One was the elimination of Critical Care, which on a full-year basis would have impacted earnings per share to the tune of about $0.35. We're also picking up in the fourth quarter some additional expense related to three of the four acquisitions that we announced earlier, which hit us in Q4. Q4 does not reflect some of the benefits of the right sizing that we conducted earlier and that we will see in 2025. Yes. Obviously, the big driver is top-line growth, and we'll be prepared to talk about that for Edwards and for different product lines on December 4. And you're right, we tried to give you some building blocks for margins, both operating margin. We talked about the special tax rate benefits we achieved in 2024, which we're not going to model achieving in 2025. And as Bernard just mentioned, we're going to see benefits from some of the actions we've taken this year when we hit the full year 2025. So, those are the different moving pieces that we can give you for now, and we'll take you through the top-line impact in December. Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. First on China, this is a one-time adjustment to a rebate for a distributor in China. It does not have anything to do with our operations or our sales growth in China at this point. As it relates to selling days, yes, there are three fewer selling days in Q4 than there were in Q3, and that impacts us when we start talking about sales dollars. But what's important to know and remember is the procedure volume on an average daily basis is growing sequentially in Q4 over Q3. Well, I understood the first part of your question. Let me answer it, and then maybe you can help me on the second part of the question. So, yes, for Q4, the guidance assumes mid-20s or implies mid-20s percentage operating margin. For next year, we expect that to grow to the range of 27% to 28%, which is also the same as our full-year 2024 operating margin. And help me with the other piece of your question, Vijay. I believe the selling days were comparable or the same in Q4 of 2023 as in 2024. We'll check that, and I'll come back on if that's not right. Well, I'll start. And you said it perfectly, David, yes, 27% to 28% implies the impact of the acquisitions and the rightsizing moves that we made this year. And it is a base off of which we will grow. And our plan is that we're going to continue to expand operating margins after we get through 2025. Daveen? So the 27% to 28% includes 3 of the 4 acquisitions. We're not being very specific about what the implications would be for Jena. As we mentioned, we're responding to questions that we've received, and we're expecting that we'll get that that closed next year. As it relates to earnings per share, yes, let's not go there. I don't really want to get overly specific about what that looks like, again, because we want to paint the full picture, including top line growth when we get to the investor conference in December. Yes. Travis, we're thinking about it really positively. We've got a lot of positive catalysts for TAVR. And at the same time, it's just premature to start talking about what the growth rates look like. We're excited to lay it all out for you when we get to December. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Yes. I think for gross margin, we're expecting in the fourth quarter that we'll be back to the high end of our original guidance range of 76% to 78%. And that high end of 76% to 78% is also a reasonable preliminary modeling assumption for 2025. Obviously, there's a lot that can change between now and then. We got foreign exchange running through there. But at this point, that's as much as we can do to help you out. Joanne, thanks for the question. On the first one, the specific impact that we know is relating to the China distributor adjustment, which is about $5 million. The other items that we mentioned are not something that we're ready to quantify at this point. Obviously, we'll talk about everything that happened in the quarter once we finished the quarter, but that's the one number that we can give you right now."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "No. Hey, thanks, Robbie. This is Daveen. Appreciate the question. Maybe I'll just start off with a couple overall comments on EVOQUE. Obviously, we've been very pleased so far with the introduction of EVOQUE in both the U.S. and in Europe. We've really seen strong physician and patient demand, which really enforces that there's a lot of unmet needs for these patients. And we've loved to see so far with EVOQUE that we've got very predictable times that are very similar to the clinical trial - that are very similar from both clinical trial sites as well as new sites. And clinical outcomes are very much similar to TRISCEND II. And we also have seen in the U.S. where we just have EVOQUE that from our experience in Europe where we have both repair and replacement, we see that it's important to have a portfolio of both repair and replacement technologies to really treat the diversity of these complex patients that are tricuspid patients. And so right now, we're continuing to open up new centers, activating new sites, focusing on other big tricuspid centers, really with robust training and high clinical support. And we're continuing to add to our clinical kind of support training team. Specifically to your question about repair and replacement, I think we're all still figuring that out about who's the right patient for each. We see that there may be some anatomical considerations where one may be better for than another. But I think as a world, we're still all trying to figure this out. But we really do believe that you need both technologies to really see, to really see, to treat the most number of patients. Two other quick comments are, obviously over time, we believe that EVOQUE in our portfolio, now if you pull back up and look at TMTD, EVOQUE's going to become a larger and larger percent of our portfolio. But right now, PASCAL is still our largest growth driver on a year-on-year basis just because it's a more established base and a larger base overall. But we look exciting to treating more and more patients with both EVOQUE and PASCAL. Yes. No problem at all. Yes. Right now, we are obviously in a national coverage analysis position where CMS is working along their pathway and through their work where we expect to see a draft NCD hopefully come out by year-end, and we hope to have an NCD in place by the end of Q1. And we're fully supportive of CMS's efforts to get this out as quickly as possible to support patients. Yes, sure. So the NTAP, which started October 1 is about incremental payment above the existing DRG. So a hospital center, depending on their cost structure and it's very center-dependent, can get incremental payment when they do an EVOQUE case for Medicare for that case. The NCD is about coverage meaning which patients are covered or not to get the payment. So the NCD and what is written in the NCD will help determine which patients and which centers do EVOQUE, and which patients would get reimbursed. The NTAP helps increase the amount of payment for each patient when they do a case. Great. And a follow-up question you had, Joanne, just on about M3. No, we still continue to be excited about SAPIEN M3. This is the first transfemoral sub-30 French mitral valve replacement system, and it's really built off SAPIEN, which we know has been put in thousands of different mitral positions. So right now for Europe, last quarter, we announced we continue to anticipate European launch in mid-2025, and we would have the U.S. at some point after. Specifically related to the U.S., we are in the 1-year follow-up period this year of the M3, and then it takes some time obviously to put the data together, get the PMA in and then there as a standard kind of FDA timeline review whether there's a panel or not. But we continue to be excited about SAPIEN M3. But Larry had a comment too, yes. No, I appreciate the question, Adam. So talking a little bit first about the NTAP and EVOQUE. Obviously, I think the incremental reimbursement obviously provides a tailwind to people wanting to use EVOQUE. There were some centers who were maybe holding off a little bit or taking a little bit more time to get the EVOQUE training curve leading up to NTAP, then they're waiting for NTAP to get on board. But that being said, we're still just seeing such strong demand across the board from different centers to open up new centers that I think it provides a little bit catalyst, but we just have consistent demand from centers. We haven't got a chance to open up yet across the board. So that's probably a comment on NTAP. Specifically on the 56, we're excited with the 56 approval at that fourth size, now larger size on. We don't have perfect data but based on what we've seen from previously screened patients, it maybe adds 20% or 25% applicability to the overall pool. So we're glad to have the size available for those patients who need it."

            "content": "[Audio Gap]...of $1.4 billion increase 10% on a constant currency basis versus the year-ago period, slightly ahead of our expectations. TAVR and TMTT both contributed significantly to growth in the third quarter as more patients globally benefited from our catheter-based structural heart therapies. During the quarter, our team made important advancements in our clinical research and new product introduction to address the unmet needs of structural heart patients around the world. Next week at TCT, you will hear more about our commitment to generating important clinical evidence to help physicians and the healthcare ecosystem take care of the many patients in need. At the conference, we will be discussing the pivotal clinical data presentation of early TAVR, TRISCEND II and CLASP IID, along with more than 20 other important updates. Edwards is leading the advancement of science in this large, diverse, and rapidly growing field. Our priority remains positioning TAVR for long-term growth. In addition to introducing differentiated next-gen technologies, we are leading several global initiatives, including reaching more patients through patient awareness, activation and access, and enhancing physician training and support programs. For TMTT, we continue to scale our fast-growing business, and we are pleased with its trajectory over the last several quarters. Key initiatives include broadening the launch of PASCAL, advancing the introduction of EVOQUE in the U.S. and in Europe, and launching SAPIEN M3 in Europe next year. Edwards' unique pipeline of innovation should drive strong multi-year growth. We are also committed to bringing differentiated surgical innovation to patients, supported by strong evidence generation, ensuring we remain at the forefront of surgical advancement. Moreover, we are entering new therapeutic areas, such as aortic regurgitation, or AR, and implantable heart failure management, or IHFM. These initiatives align with our long-term vision of expanding into more therapies, driving sustainable growth for Edwards. It was an especially busy quarter, as our team around the world delivered on our strategy. We closed the sale of Critical Care in September, took important action to sharpen our focus on structural heart, including integrating recent acquisition and right-sizing the company for long-term profitable growth. As we look ahead, we see significant growth opportunities across our differentiated portfolio of leading structural heart therapies for TAVR-AS, TAVR-AR, TMTT, Surgical, and IHFM. This commitment will be discussed in detail at the upcoming investor conference, where we will outline our strategies for differentiated value creation in the years ahead. Now, I will provide details on Q3 results by product group. In TAVR, third quarter global sales of $1 billion increased 6% when adjusted for currency and billing days. Edwards' strong competitive position and pricing remain stable globally, although we experienced a few instances of regional pressure. We are confident in our differentiated technology, high-quality evidence, and the value we continue to demonstrate to patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems. We remain deeply committed to advancing evidence for AS patients. In August, one-year data from the RIA trial, a first-of-its-kind trial focused exclusively on outcomes for women receiving TAVR, were presented at the ESC meeting held in London. Investigators reported superior outcome for women receiving the Edwards SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra Valves as compared to those receiving surgical aortic valve replacement for the primary endpoints of death, stroke, and re-hospitalization at one year. We are proud of this high-quality clinical research. The outstanding success of TAVR points to the importance of valve selection for women undergoing aortic valve replacement, especially those with small annuli, to preserve their option for a future valve-in-valve procedures, ensuring the lifetime management of their disease. Next week at TCT, the clinical community will hear results from the early TAVR trial. The trial is the first and largest randomized controlled trial to-date studying asymptomatic severe AS patients and the impact of early intervention with TAVR. Turning to the U.S., our year-over-year third quarter TAVR sales growth rate was in line with our global TAVR constant currency growth rate. We believe our U.S. competitive position was largely unchanged. In the U.S., although hospitals and physicians continue to acknowledge our team capacity constraint nationally, it is encouraging that many hospitals are exploring additional investments to address future workflow needs to manage these patients. We know from experience that hospitals have historically demonstrated the ability to scale to support trans-catheter procedure growth over time. Outside of the U.S., in the third quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was in line with our global TAVR growth. In Europe, our market position improved sequentially, supported by the continued launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We are pleased with the exceptional patient outcome delivered with this platform, and we expect this momentum to continue as more centers adopt our best-in-class TAVR platform. Additionally, we received CE mark approval for our Alterra system for congenital heart patients. Alterra should result in quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that this younger patient will require over their lifetimes. We have initiated the introduction of this novel therapy in Europe, and initial feedback from clinicians has been positive. In Japan, slower market growth pressured our results. We remain dedicated to expanding this therapy to address significant under-treatment of AS among the substantial elderly population in Japan. In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 TAVR result, which were slightly above our expectation. Our 5% to 7% growth guidance for the full year remains unchanged. However, we expect the Q4 year-over-year sales growth rate to be lower due to some one-time items that Scott will describe later. We remain confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth, driven by our differentiated TAVR technology, our deep commitment to advancing patient care through high-quality clinical evidence, new indication, and our investment in patient activation initiatives. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of JC Medical and JenaValve, early innovators in the treatment of AR. These acquisitions provide an opportunity in a new therapeutic area to address the unmet needs of AR patients around the world, a deadly disease that impacts more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. alone, and is largely untreated today. As the pioneer in valve innovation, we believe Edwards is best positioned to develop, study, and deliver novel technologies. I am pleased to report that we performed our first implant in the Journey pivotal trial with the Edwards J-Valve AR system, recently acquired from JC Medical. As noted in our announcement of the JenaValve transaction, the acquisition is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We are responding to a second request from the FTC in connection with their review and anticipate closing the acquisition mid-2025. Now turning to TMTT, our unique innovations, including the PASCAL repair system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system, and the upcoming SAPIEN 3 mitral replacement system, provide a broad set of treatment options to serve the many diverse and complex patients in need. We are pleased with the Q3 result, achieving 91 million in sales, representing 74% growth over the prior year. Sales were led by PASCAL growth globally, we continue the initial commercial expansion of EVOQUE in the U.S. and Europe. Globally, we continue to see more patients diagnosed and treated as long as strong therapy adoption, resulting in mitral procedures experiencing ongoing double-digit growth and even stronger tricuspid therapy growth. Adoption of a differentiated PASCAL technology is expanding in both new and existing sites around the world. We look forward to presenting the two-year outcomes of a CLASP IID pivotal trial studying DMR patients at TCT next week. We are also pleased to announce the earlier than expected completion of enrollment for the CLASP IITR trial studying TR patients with PASCAL randomized against optimal medical therapy alone. This achievement is great news for patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation given the differentiated characteristic of PASCAL. The EVOQUE launch continues to progress well as we successfully activate new sites in both the U.S. and Europe beyond our initial trial centers. We are also increasing our field teams to deliver on our high-touch model to support new sites as we bring EVOQUE into their clinical practice in order to achieve excellent patient outcomes. The strong interest in this therapy continues to highlight the large unmet need. The full 400 patient cohort of a TRISCEND II pivotal study at one year will also be presented at TCT next week. In our continued efforts to reach more patients, a fourth and larger size EVOQUE valve, the 56 millimeter, was recently approved in the U.S. The addition of this larger valve size will expand the addressable patient population. On October 1, EVOQUE became eligible for Medicare's new technology add-on payment. This additional payment above standard reimbursement is in effect for three years and will support increased access to this breakthrough therapy for the many U.S. patients in need. Based on the ongoing global adoption of our two therapies, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we remain confident in our full year full year TMTT self-guidance at the high end of 320 million to 340 million. In surgical, third quarter sales from continuing operation of $240 million increased 5% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS, and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients best treated surgically, including those undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence and enrollment in Europe for a momentous clinical trial studying MITRIS is ahead of schedule. In addition, a comments AR manuscript has been published in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, which shows positive outcome for patients with AR treated with RESILIA tissue valve after five years. Finally, two investigator-initiated registries out of Europe, Endure and Impact, have shown favorable outcome in younger and more complex patients who were implanted with the RESILIA INSPIRIS valve. In summary, we continue to believe that our full year 2024 surgical sales growth will be 6% to 8%. Turning to structural heart failure, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Endotronix, marking our entry into implantable heart failure management, or IHFM. Our vision for IHFM is consistent with our other structural heart technologies to establish a platform that ensures best-in-class outcome for patients in need, resulting in multi-years of growth. We released strong 12-month results from the proactive HF pivotal trial at the HFSA conference, which demonstrated significant benefit to patients managed with the Cordella system, an implantable pulmonary artery pressure sensor allowing early targeted heart failure intervention. In addition, the proactive HF2 trial has also been initiated, which will extend the evidence base for implantable heart failure management and further demonstrate the value of data-driven heart failure management. With the recent approval of Cordella in the U.S. and the completion of our first cases, our focus is on building our commercial team, deploying physician training, case support to ensure high quality of outcomes. Revenue will ramp over time as we focus on discipline, commercialization, outcome, system usage, and patient engagement. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. We are confident that our innovative therapy will allow Edwards to treat more patients around the world and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefit of breakthrough technologies, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark. No, just to add on what Scott said, Larry, obviously we are also expecting growth from our continued operation in 2025 together with the EPS leverage. And we will provide a full guidance during investor conference in December. No, no. I think you said it all and well, Larry. We are part of the issue here. We are such an innovator in the space with PASCAL, with EVOQUE, with TAVR. We have a market-leading position in TAVR. And you need to realize also that when we bring in EVOQUE in one of the larger TAVR centers, it is taking, it is needing a lot of resource. We want to make it, TR is a new disease. So the health basically, this heart team is learning about the new disease, is training about the new device. We are, then they are screening patients. So it's not like, one day kind of adjusting their workflow. It is taking multiple days, weeks, but we are very confident that they are patients, tricuspid patient, mitral patient, AS patient. We are bringing innovative technologies. The healthcare system have proven to us in the past, they know how to scale and all of these procedures are profitable. So we are confident that yes, it is an issue right now. We don't believe that it is a long-term issue, which is not going to take a few weeks to solve, but it is not going to take a few years to solve also. Thanks, David, for the question. Anything related to TCT, I suggest we wait until next week, what we did in the next week to make sure we can go very deep with you. We have an event on Monday, and we have even Wednesday, after the 2 presentations. So we will go deep then, and we are also going deep at investor conference. Now with regards to the NCD for EVOQUE, maybe you want to touch on that, Daveen? Maybe adding a general comment about profitability and all these kind of things. As you have seen in Q3, we took action to optimize the company. We are looking very seriously at, in a very thoughtful fashion, about cost optimization, resource allocation. So what we want to deliver is sustainable, healthy, profitable growth for the years to come as a company. Thank you. Matt, thanks for the question. Again, look, we are going to discuss this in full detail on Monday. It is a little bit not easy for us to discuss before Monday. The trial is embargo, it is a blinded study. We cannot go there right now. But for sure, on Monday, please attend the event and also at the investor conference. Larry is going to talk about TAVR. Yes. So if I look at the entire company, I look at, for instance, surgical, 65 years of pioneering innovation. Today, we are, by far, a global leader in premium pricing. Our valve, surgical valve, are the best valves. When I look at TAVR, we are the global leader with a premium pricing, and it is the valve, our TAVR valve is the valve of choice. If you look at what we are doing with EVOQUE, again, we are a pioneer again, creating category leading the space. We bring value to the entire health care ecosystem. So one is we are proud about our history. We like our strategy. It's working. What we are bringing is breakthrough technologies, bringing value to patients and all stakeholders. We know that competition is coming, and it has been there for many years. The structural heart is a large space. There are many patients. It is growing. It is attracting a lot of competitors. But we like our position. We like our technology. We like our strategy. And there are more patients to treat in surgical, in TAVR, in TMTT, in heart failure. And this is why we are so confident in us being able to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in the many years to come. Thanks for the question. Yes. No, thank you for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark, and myself welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thank you, everyone. And see you next week at TCT."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Second Quarter 2024 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Kevin. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian; and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Larry Wood, our Global President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of TMTT; Wayne Markowitz, our Global Leader of Surgical Structural Heart; and Katie Szyman, our Global Leader of Critical Care. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2024 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance and expectations for growth opportunities, strategy, leverage and integration of acquisitions, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in the company's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us. This afternoon we issued two press releases which the team and I will review in more detail with you now. The first, outlining our Q2 results. And the second, highlighting our acquisition of JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of aortic rehabilitation or AR. And Endotronix, a leader in heart failure management solutions. I will start with our second quarter performance. Total company sales of $1.6 billion increased 8% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. In addition, we made important advancements in our clinical research, new product introductions and efforts by Edwards employees to address the unmet needs of many more patients around the world. TAVR growth in the second quarter was lower than expected, yet we are pleased with the increasingly significant contribution from TMTT. Our vision for TMTT is becoming a reality and our strategic commitment has developed into a growth portfolio of differentiated technology. Overall, Edwards remain well-positioned to deliver strong, sustainable growth. We also announced this afternoon two acquisitions, JenaValve and Endotronix. We have known this company for many years. Discussions with the companies have been ongoing for some time and the timing of these acquisitions coincided with earnings. We are pleased to expand into two new structural heart therapeutic areas, AR and heart failure, and we will leverage our innovation capabilities with worldclass science and clinical evidence to ensure accelerated access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. Now, I will provide some additional detail on Q2 results by product group. In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $1.04 billion increased 6% year-over-year, lower than we planned. Edwards competitive position did not meaningfully change globally, although we experienced some regional pressure, and we maintain pricing. We are confident in our differentiated technology, high-quality evidence and the value we continue to demonstrate to patients, clinicians and the healthcare system. We remain focused on continuing our deep commitment to advancing evidence for AS patients. At the New York Valves meeting in June, we presented additional analysis from the PARTNER trials, which demonstrated excellent clinical outcome up to five years in women and patient with small annuli. Adding to the global body of evidence on the platform, we also anticipate additional data from the RHEIA study to be presented at the upcoming [ESC] (ph) Meeting in London. RHEIA is a prospective randomized study in more than 400 patients across 35 sites in Europe comparing the safety and efficacy of TAVR versus surgery in women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We are actively pursuing significant opportunity to grow TAVR globally over the long-term and are proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for aortic stenosis patient through the progress and early TAVR trials, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. Early TAVR trial results will be presented at TCT this year, and we believe if the data are compelling, it could have a meaningful impact on the timing for patient treatment, while also streamlining referral and patient care for all severe AS patients. In the US, our year-over-year second quarter TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global constant currency growth rate. We believe our US competitive position was largely unchanged. Second quarter, US TAVR sales grew slower than expected. The continued growth and expansion of structural heart therapies, including newly approved tricuspid therapies and other fast-growing structural heart therapies put pressure on hospital workflows, which impacted TAVR. These pressures were also observed in the recent spike in emergent TAVR cases as reflected in claims data. As centers adopt these new therapies and they become part of extended processes, we expect this will stabilize. We know from experience that hospital have historically demonstrated the ability to scale to support transcatheter procedure growth over time. We believe significant undertreatment of severe AS persists, evidence demonstrates that a large number of in-system patients currently go untreated. We are accelerating our efforts to improve referrals and treatment rates for patient already in the hospital system who are suffering from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We recently launched the Edwards ENACT patient activation program, which leverage a comprehensive cardiovascular AI platform and worldclass support to bring real-time insights to TAVR program and improve quality of care for patients. This first of its kind program is focused on streamlining the identification, evaluation and treatment of severe aortic stenosis patient within the hospital system. Outside of the US, in the second quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly above our global TAVR growth. In Japan, we generated double-digit sales growth driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We continue to focus on expanding the ability of this therapy and believe AS remain a significant under threated disease among the substantial elderly population in Japan. In Europe, while share is down slightly on an annualized basis, we were pleased with the momentum, driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We are pleased with high procedure success rate and exceptional patient outcome. We expect the momentum to continue to build as more centers have experienced with the first-choice valve for lifetime management. In closing, we now anticipate second half TAVR sales growth similar to the first half year-over-year growth rate of 5% to 7% full year growth rate versus previously guidance of 8% to 10%. This equate to full year global TAVR sales of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. We believe hospitals are motivated to continue scaling to accommodate increasing volume of transcatheter procedures, which will bring tremendous value to patients and the healthcare system. We remain confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth, driven by our differentiated TAVR portfolio, our deep commitment to advancing patient care for high-quality clinical evidence and new indications and our investment in patient activation initiative. Turning to TMTT. Our deep structural heart expertise has enabled us to significantly advance our portfolio of differentiated technologies, including the PASCAL repair system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system and the SAPIEN M3 mitral replacement system. Our exciting pipeline of innovations is addressing the large unmet needs for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. In Q2, we achieved positive results with sales of $83 million, representing a 75% increase versus the prior year. Q2 sales were led by PASCAL globally and early commercial introduction of EVOQUE in the US and Europe. PASCAL adoption is growing, reflecting its premium differentiation and the value it brings to physician and patients. We believe the mitral tier markets continues to grow double-digit in both the US and Europe. We are excited to bring this therapy to more geographies, more physicians and more patients. The EVOQUE commercial launch continue to progress well. Our disciplined strategy is focused on outstanding patient outcome in centers investing resources required to grow a successful tricuspid program. We are now opening new centers both in Europe and the US after having started with our clinical trial sites. We continue to see strong interest in the therapy, which reflects the significant unmet need in this population of patient who have few options for treatment. Our early real-world commercial experience has demonstrated excellent clinical results. Consistent with those from the TRISCEND II trial. We look forward to presenting the full cohort of TRISCEND II data at the TCT Conference in October. Last month, CMS announced the opening of a national coverage analysis for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement. Since EVOQUE was granted FDA breakthrough status and is utilizing the CMS parallel review process, we believe CMS can move quickly to finalize national coverage. SAPIEN M3 remains on-track to be our first transcatheter mitral valve replacement therapy to gain regulatory approval and launch around the world. We are also pleased to have received a breakthrough designation from the FDA, and we completed enrollment in the mitral annulus classification or MAC arm of our ENCIRCLE study. We now expect SAPIEN M3 to receive CE Mark earlier than previously expected by mid-2025, with FDA approval in the US to follow in 2026. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of JenaValve. JenaValve early-stage technology will add to our growing pipeline of innovative therapy in TMTT and we expect to close the acquisition later this year. We further expect that JenaValve technology combined with Edwards expertise in mitral disease will enhance the company TMVR technologies to address large unmet structural heart patient needs and support sustainable long-term growth. Based on the first half 2024 momentum and the ongoing global adoption of our differentiated technology PASCAL and EVOQUE we are increasing full year sales guidance for TMTT to the higher end of our previous $320 million to $340 million range. We remain confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement therapies for both mitral and tricuspid disease will offer clinician the broader set of options needed to treat this complex and diverse patients. The advancement of our long-term TMTT strategy has positioned us for strong, sustainable growth over many years, driven by a growing portfolio of innovative therapies. In surgical structural heart second quarter sales of $264 million increased 5% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients best treated surgically, including those undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence and have completed enrollment in the US and Canada for our momentous critical trial studying RESILIA performance and the mitral position. MITRIS adoption in Europe is ramping up, and we are pleased to have been granted reimbursement for the device in France earlier than expected. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2024 surgical sales will be 6% to 8% driven by continued adoption of our RESILIA portfolio and growth in overall heart valve surgeries. In Critical Care, second quarter sales were $246 million, which increased 7% versus the prior year. Growth was led by a pressure monitoring devices using the ICU with strong contribution from our SMART Recovery technologies, including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for Swan-Ganz catheter. Critical Care remains focused on driving growth through SMART Recovery and SMART Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decision and get patients home to their family faster. Since announcing the sales of Critical Care to Becton Dickinson in June, our team has made significant progress and we plan to close by late Q3. I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. Turning now to the strategic acquisition of JenaValve and Endotronix. These acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas to address the unmet needs of AR and heart failure patients around the world. Furthermore, the acquisition reflects our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our unique strategy and reinforce our confidence in Edwards sustainable long-term growth. Starting with JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of AR, a deadly disease that impacts more than 100,000 patients in the US alone and is largely untreated today. Edwards anticipate US FDA approval of the JenaValve Trilogy Heart Valve System in late 2025, which will represent the first approved therapy for patient suffering from AR. Edwards will invest to accelerate development of this novel technology to enable earlier patient access. As the pioneers in valve innovation, we believe we are best positioned to lead this next frontier of aortic valve disease treatment. We expect this to be the beginning of a long-term iterative strategy similar to TAVR. Turning to Endotronix. Edwards made its first investment in the company in 2016. So we are very familiar with the technology, the opportunity and the employees. Many structural heart patients Edwards serves today also suffer from heart failure with limited options. This acquisition will expand Edwards structural heart portfolio into a new therapeutic area to address the large unmet needs of patients suffering from heart failure, which we believe has a significant long-term growth opportunity. Last month, Endotronix received FDA approval for Cordella, an implantable preliminary artillery pressure sensor that directly measure the leading indicator of congestion following the publication of a successful US pivotal trial. We are pleased to enter the structural heart therapeutic area with innovation, worldclass science, and clinical evidence to provide access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. We anticipate this investment will strengthen its leadership in structural heart innovation and represent long-term growth opportunity. Minimal revenue contribution from JenaValve and Endotronix is expected to begin late in 2025. As you can tell, we have a lot of positive momentum and many catalysts across our core businesses, TAVR, TMTT and Surgical combined with opportunities to reach new patient population. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Ullem: [Technical Difficulty] quarter total company sales performance, where TAVR sales growth came in below our expectations. However, it's important to understand broader context, we are pleased that TMTT continues to outperform our expectations. And overall underlying sales growth, including Critical Care was nearly 8%, adjusted EPS was $0.70. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included one-time separation expenses related to the sale of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. So, now I'll cover additional details of our P&L, which reflect total company results, including Critical Care. Note that Critical Care will be presented as a discontinued operation in the 10-Q we will file next week. As we noted in the press release, we'll provide Q4 2024 information reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when we report third quarter results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.1% compared to 77.7% in the same period last year. Last year's second quarter gross profit margin benefited from a more favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. We expect Edwards Q3 adjusted gross profit margin, including Critical Care to be in line with Q2, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Adjusted, selling general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $509 million or 31.2% of sales compared to $469 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of field-based personnel to support growth of our transcatheter therapies, including the launch and rollout of PASCAL and EVOQUE. Adjusted research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 12% over the prior year to $303 million or 18.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 5.2% or adjusted 8.4%. Our unusually favorable non-GAAP rate in the second quarter reflects several positive one-time items that were recorded during the quarter. This unexpected favorability in our tax rate benefited earnings per share by $0.04 in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter adjusted sales growth by 120 basis points or $17.6 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter adjusted gross profit margin by 60 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was reduced $47 million for payments associated with special activities relating to the separation of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $333 million. First half adjusted free cash flow was $539 million. We expect to receive cash from the sale of Critical Care in the third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30. Now I'll finish this update with comments about our previously announced sale of Critical Care, as well as guidance relating to our acquisition announcements. We announced on June 3 that Edwards entered into an agreement to sell Critical Care to BD, and we are planning to close the sale late in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recorded $80 million of one-time costs associated with the sale. Additional one-time costs will be incurred throughout 2024. We expect Q3 sales, including the assumption that we own Critical Care for the full quarter of $1.56 billion to $1.64 billion and Q3 earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. We do not expect the recently announced acquisitions to contribute to Edwards sales in 2024. We intend to provide fourth quarter guidance reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when third quarter results are reported in October. We will also provide 2025 guidance at our Investor Conference in New York on December 4. In the meantime, I'll share a few early expectations for 2025. Next year we expect minimal revenue from acquisitions. While we are planning on incremental operating expenses from these early-stage companies, partially offset by operational efficiencies we plan to realize following the sale of Critical Care. We do not expect increased operating efficiencies to completely offset the loss of profits from the sale of Critical Care in 2025, but we are planning healthy, long-term profit growth. In addition, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet to support continued internal and external investments as well as opportunistic share repurchase. Most importantly, we are confident in the moves we have made to reshape our portfolio of technologies to focus specifically on structural heart. The sale of Critical Care provides extra management bandwidth, as well as additional liquidity to fund external growth investments. And at the same time, our original vision for TMTT is becoming a reality and the early-stage investments we made in companies like JenaValve and Endotronix position us to acquire high-quality and high potential businesses with talented employees. We have other jewels in our portfolio of internal and external investments that will benefit Edwards in the years ahead. Over the long-term, we see an exciting future with expanded opportunities in large and growing market, which we believe will result in sustainable double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. So with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. So let me share a few closing thoughts. In TAVR, we have significant opportunities, and we are committed to growing globally by advancing science over long-term, progress and early TAVR trials could fundamentally change how AS patient are treated. In TMTT, our deep expertise has enabled us to significantly advance our exciting portfolio of innovation. And our long-term TMTT strategy has position us for strong, sustainable growth over many years. In surgical structural heart, we continue to see strong global adoption of our premium surgical technologies. Our JenaValve and Endotronix acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas. The buffer presents significant long-term opportunities. We remain confident that our innovative therapy will allow Edwards to treat more patient around the world and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. Our special inclinations increasingly recognize the significant benefit of transcatheter-based technology, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. With that, I will turn back to Mark.\nMark Wilterding: Thank you, Bernard. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Kevin, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me. Let me start with early TAVR, and then I had a follow up for Scott on 2025. So what would be -- for early TAVR, what would be compelling to you? Do you need to show a mortality benefit to be more compelling? And how should we think about the impact on your TAVR growth if the study is positive, do you expect it to accelerate the TAVR growth in 2025 above the 5% to 7% you expect this year? And I had one follow up.\nLarry Wood: Sure. Hey, Larry. This is Larry. Thanks for your question. I think at a very high level there needs to be a compelling story for why early intervention is better and basically make the case against watchful waiting. And we've done a lot of work when we were powering the trial, and we obviously had a lot of belief in it. The primary endpoint is death, stroke and rehospitalization. And so, it's really the composite of all those. And winning that trial and obviously, the more you would win it by makes the more compelling case. In terms of the individual components, we'll have to look at those. But when you think about it from the patient journey if they're waiting and bad things are happening to them while they're waiting, and it's resulting in unplanned rehospitalization, or it's resulting in stroke, or it's resulting in mortality, all those are very meaningful things, and that's why they're all composites in the endpoint, so we'll have to wait and see the data, we'll have to see the story, but death, stroke and rehospitalization has kind of become almost a standard now for most of these trials because the clinical community believe these are all important considerations and endpoints.\nBernard Zovighian: Maybe let me add something to what Larry said. For sure asymptomatic is very important to us and to the community and to patients. But it is one thing of one of the many things we are doing, and we are confident in growing this TAVR opportunity. So asymptomatic is one, patient activation, we see some impact already, but also moderate. So if you think about over the next few years, we see many catalysts. It is why we are confident in this TAVR opportunity. Granted, we know that Q2 was lower than expected, and I guess we are going to talk about it, but in front of us, we see that this opportunity as a big one, like we saw it few years ago, still we see it, still we are confident, and we are doing all the things to realize this opportunity.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And Scott, thanks for the initial color on 2025. I'm sure you know that's important. Everyone on this call right now to try to understand -- try to as best as we can to model that. So a couple of pieces, follow ups on that. The press release says strong sustainable growth. It doesn't say 10% operational growth for the remaining business in 2025. I just want to confirm that that 10% from the analyst meeting last year in December is not -- you're not reiterating that today. And second, on dilution, we estimate -- I think most of us estimate about $0.40 of dilution from Critical Care spin, any reaction to that? And the incremental spending you talked about from the acquisitions, any additional color on that? And just lastly, the use of the proceeds, should we just assume share, buyback or additional M&A? Thank you.\nScott Ullem: All right. That's a multi-part follow up question. Let me try to hit a couple of the things you asked about, Larry. First of all, on the 10% long-term top line growth, we're just not commenting on guidance at this point, it doesn't mean we're increasing it or decreasing it or changing it. It's just the kind of thing where we don't update that during the course of the year, so we're not providing an update today. We will definitely provide an update as we always do at our December investor conference. For dilution from Critical Care. Yes, a lot of this depends upon how we end up prioritizing investments in the company as we separate Critical Care. And as you can imagine, there are a lot of different moving pieces as we do that. So we're not going to be able to give you a specific figure on, I'll call it, remain co, ex-Critical Care at this point. And it does tie to your question about incremental operating expenses that we're absorbing with these acquisitions, and those depend upon a couple of things. One is, when we actually close the acquisitions and start to realize that spending. Two, how we end up integrating them inside of Edwards. And as you can imagine, we just announced them today, so those plans are not completely developed. Finally, in terms of use of proceeds from Critical Care. As you know we're always interested in buying back stock. We're always looking for buying opportunities. But the first call on cash hasn't changed one bit, which is we're going to continue to invest in the company. We're going to continue to invest in the capacity that we need to support the growth of the company. We'll certainly be looking at other external investments. And then finally, we'll look at capital, at allocating capital to share buyback. So there's a little bit of color and we'll obviously give you a lot more as we get towards the end of the year.\nBernard Zovighian: Larry, on the guidance, I agree with what Scott said about. We are not planning to communicate the guidance on 2025. But if you look at the quarter, TAVR grew about 6%, the company about 8%. So you see a big contribution from TMTT, and we see that contribution to get bigger as we go because right now we are just at the beginning of PASCAL expansion. Just at the beginning of the EVOQUE expansion. We have M3 coming, in TAVR, we have asymptomatic end of the year, so are we confident about sustainable growth over the long-term? Yes. We are going to talk about guidance in December.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question Today is coming from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is live.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two from me. Maybe first, you talked about it in the script, but I was hoping you could give a little more, TAVR has clearly come in below your initial expectations for the year. The guidance has moved down. The US is slowing. OUS is facing pressure. We saw two of your smaller competitors, but still competitors see pretty nice growth sequentially and year-over-year. So the TAVRS taking more in Europe and outside the US, Japan. How are you thinking just about the underlying growth rate of the TAVR market? And I appreciate it's a huge opportunity and it's still a lot to conquer in the future, but in, let's call it the short to medium term, how are you thinking about the overall market growth? And is there anything you can do to help accelerate it?\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Well, obviously we expected growth rate to be higher in Q2 than it was. We had a slow start in Q1, but we were exiting March and we felt good about where we were. So this did come as a surprise. I think when we reflect back on it, and we look more deeply at it, you have to think about all the things that have shown up that are going to the same structural heart team at all of these hospitals. We're seeing rapid growth in mitral repair. We're seeing a lot of growth in other procedures, and we had two new therapy approvals recently in the tricuspid space, and I think a little bit we looked at the procedure volumes and the hospitals have shown a pretty good job of being able to handle these things. We probably underestimated the burden of even starting these new programs, even preparing to start these new programs, because you have to screen the patients early on. There's a lot of learning, screen failures, all of those things, and I think it's just tackling the teams. Now, in terms of things we can do to help, there are certainly things we can do to help. We can do a lot of imaging workups and take some of the load off the team. We can do device prep. We can come in with our benchmark program and teach them efficiencies and do those things. But once a program has been optimized that it really does come down to the hospital to add another team or add additional days and do those sorts of things. So there are some things we can do, but we can't do everything. I think the other thing is, I think highlighting this for the clinicians and we're very confident, this isn't some slowdown because there's a lack of patients. We didn't see any of the fundamentals change in terms of new data that was concerning or any of these things, I think it's just a matter of the workflow right now. And we need to be able to engage with hospitals. But two important things we saw is we saw an increase in time from CT to procedure, which indicates patients are waiting longer and the other thing that we saw was a sharp increase in the number of cases being quoted as emergent versus routine. And I think that speaks to these patients waiting in the queue as these workflow issues sort out. So I think hospitals will certainly do that in time. These patients don't wait well, and we know that there's a lot of them, but we're going to have to continue to work through that with the hospitals.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes. So let me add on what Larry said. To be fair, we are contributing a little bit on this pressure. At the same time we are benefiting. If you look at the TMTT growth in the quarter. So we are contributing and benefiting at the same time. Now, big picture, we have seen this picture in the past, don't you think we have seen hospital facing like more to do, more technology to adopt, to be trying on new technologies, and we are very good at scaling. We are very good at learning. We are very good at adapting their workflows in the cath lab, so we believe it is temporary. And we are the real still with this team are, with Larry are partnering on this one. So we are fully focusing on this one helping in real hospital. But we have faith the hospital are going to do that like they did it in the last 10 years. Thanks.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. And maybe a follow-up to that guidance implies roughly stable TAVR first half into second half. I appreciate the need to be conservative, but it sounds like some of the learnings you saw in second quarter could possibly help in the back half of the year. Maybe just walk through the thought process of the 5% to 7% TAVR guide and kind of what you're baking into that? Thanks a lot.\nScott Ullem: Yes. I mean, it's pretty straightforward which is we're baking into it similar market conditions. The year-over-year calculation is pretty similar. Fourth quarter comp gets a little bit tougher. But we think that all things considered, that 5% of the low end, 7% on the high end captures the likely scenario for the second half combined with the first half that we've already reported.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks.\nBernard Zovighian: We believe, to add on that one, we believe early TAVR, TCT, it will be already almost the end of a quarter, Robbie. So TCT is in late October. So we believe it will have a very minimal impact in Q4. So it is why we didn't want to take too much risk here.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nDavid Roman: Thank you, and good afternoon. I wanted just to come back actually on some of Larry's comments there regarding, and maybe you're characterizing it as capacity. And as you think about the myriad of therapies going into structural heart right now, whether that is some of the new valve therapies, whether it's Watchman. To what extent do you think hostile economics factor into the decision and prioritization making here and how does that, if it does in any way impact your kind of pricing decision around TAVR or EVOQUE?\nLarry Wood: Yes, it's a good question. And I'll defer to Daveen on EVOQUE, but I'll start with the TAVR side of it. It doesn't really change the pricing, and we don't think this is an economically driven thing. I think when new therapies come forward, hospitals are competitive. They want to be able to offer all of the therapies. And that means they want to aggressively start these newer programs and make sure that they can offer all of the options for their patients. And so, I think that's what's driving some of this more than other things. And I think all companies before they're willing to bring a new technology in, they want to -- the center has to demonstrate competence, right? They have to demonstrate they have the ability to screen, they have to have patients in queue and all those things. And I think it becomes a big thing, but I don't think this is an economically driven thing. I think it is just the result of all the new things that are coming into the cath lab and again, I think that does get corrected with time.\nDaveen Chopra: Yes, this is Daveen, and I'll just jump in for a second here. We're seeing as we bring in new therapy like EVOQUE, right, while procedure times are relatively efficient, and they are, they're an hour-long procedures. It takes up a lot of energy, effort, thoughts, processes to start a new therapy, right? It takes a lot of bandwidth for people in terms of trying to find the patients, where are the referrals coming from? How does it kind of work through the system? How we pre-case plan? And these are often the same groups of people, valve clinic coordinators, interventional cardiologists, etc. that are working on TAVR. So as you bring in just a new therapy and start building it up, it takes a while, a lot of bandwidth and a lot of energy to get it going. But then over time, like we've seen for every other therapy, you create efficiency. It gets faster, and we're going to help them do that. But hospital then figure out, okay, now this is how the therapy is going to work its way through the system, and it becomes more efficient and becomes better so that there is more capacity to do more procedures overall.\nDavid Roman: That's very helpful. And maybe just a related follow-up to that, can you maybe unpack the $83 million in the TMTT line for us in a little bit more detail. It sounds like minimal EVOQUE contribution with PASCAL accelerating. But maybe if you could sort of delineate a little bit the different product drivers within there, and then maybe some of the different geographic drivers? And then maybe if I could sneak a follow-up into the response there, how long do you think Larry it takes to dislodge the sort of capacity constrain or sort of that digestion of multiple therapies going to the systems?\nDaveen Chopra: This is Daveen. I'll start off a little bit with TMTT. I mean, first, just at a higher level. We were actually super excited to see that in quarter two, our vision becoming more and more reality. We've made a strategic commitment that we need a portfolio of repair and replacement technologies for the many different mitral and tricuspid patients, and it was nice to see that step forward in Q2. Also, when you break it down on the level Q1 sales were led by PASCAL, right. PASCAL is a larger pool. It continues to grow in adoption. We believe in this differentiated premium technology, and it was our largest growth driver. We also did see the early commercial introduction in the US and Europe of EVOQUE, right, EVOQUE got approved in Europe late last year, in the US earlier this year, so we're beginning that important process of training centers getting up to speed, beginning to train our own internal people and start that kind of case cadence. So those were kind of the two. And in terms of size and scale, just because in Europe we've been in Europe since 2019 now that's a much larger base. Since when you have a larger base, you have kind of a stronger growth coming off that, but the US is growing up quickly now. And we're continuing to expand our technologies around the world beyond just the US and Europe.\nLarry Wood: Yes. And just to follow up, how long does it take to dislodge? It's hard for us to be exact, and I think we try to account for that in our guidance that it's not a light switch. But the best analogy I can say is when we brought TAVR into all these hospitals, we heard repeatedly that there was impact on coronary procedures and other things that were going on in the cath lab, and we were kind of taking up a little bit of that mind share, a little bit of that workflow space, but it wasn't sustainable. You can't just park your coronary patients forever. And you can't park AS patients forever. So I think once centers have certainty of the added workload and certainty of the volume, I think they add the resource, and they do the things necessary, but nobody's going to go hire a bunch of people in advance as the new therapy show up. They always are kind of recovering as the workload gets high, and I think to agree that's just how hospital systems operate.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, we are confident by experience that the hospital and we do learn fast, adjust their workflow, their processes. And this is why we are seeing it is temporary, obviously, patients when they stay home, they have a terrible quality of life, and many of them are dying, so I don't believe it is sustainable. And everybody is committed. The hospital are committed. We are committed. So when you have a full commitment behind it, we know it is going to be resolved.\nDavid Roman: Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to just start off with the TAVR outlook and kind of longer-term you guys have put a $10 billion kind of TAM forecast by 2028 in the past. Should we eventually still be thinking about that TAM opportunity being in place, but maybe pushed out a little bit or maybe the aortic regurgitation indication gets you there by 2028, but you may not be reiterating today, but it sounds like you're confident in the TAVR market in that $10 billion TAM, but not sure if you're reiterating it now.\nBernard Zovighian: Yes, I think you said it in your question. We are confident we are not updating the guidance for next year or for 2028 here on the market, but we are confident. We will do so in December at the investor conference in New York. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back and circle back on Robbie's question on TAVR. It feels like there's a little bit more of a change here. Just three months ago, you thought TAVR was going to accelerate over the course of the year. I thought the 8% to 10% at the beginning of the year was supposed to be a conservative guide. So just want to understand like, I hear what you're saying on TMTT, but that's a small number of faction versus the overall TAVR centers, so I don't know if there's anything else that you'd kind of call out or kind of what surprised you on the TAVR line. I know there was some of the European stuff and competition there that you called out last quarter, just understanding kind of the full change and why you got the initial TAVR guide wrong at the start of this year.\nLarry Wood: Yes. Thanks, Travis. Yes. When we exited Q1, we thought we were on a good ramp, and we thought we were on a good pace, and that's why reiterated guidance and we felt good about it and we just didn't see that play out in Q2 the way that we anticipated and by no means do I mean to say this is all Daveen's fault and it's all EVOQUE because that's not accurate or fair when you look at the number of procedures. I think it's the cumulative impact of all the things that have hit the structural heart teams over the last year, and it's one of those things you can always increase a little capacity, work a little harder, increase a little capacity, work a little bit harder, but then at some point, you reach a breakpoint when it's simply too much. And the heaviest lift for centers is starting a program and it's not just the procedure volume. It's all that screening and all of the case reviews and all the interaction that just consumes a lot of resources and a lot of time and the training, they have to go to training and observe cases, in many cases, and all of those sorts of things. And so, I think it's just the cumulative impact of those things that happen over time. And we did see the slowdown more acutely in large centers and small centers, which fits a little bit of the model as well in terms of the centers that are most likely to be looking to start these new programs and are competitive about that. And again, I said it earlier, but we did see a spike in emerging cases over routine cases, and I think that fits what we're saying as well. But that's not going to be sustainable for people. Emerging cases have more complications. They don't have as good a patient outcomes and people will have longer length of stay and that's going to adversely impact patients and the hospitals themselves. So I think people will have to adjust it over time. And we're going to have to work closely with them to help them do that.\nTravis Steed: All right. That's helpful. Any color on Q3 TAVR and kind of where that's settling out versus the full year guide. I think you guys had extra selling days in Q3. And then on the dilution from the acquisitions, I know there's like a range of outcomes like that's going to be, but we all have a pretty good sense of Critical Care and the dilution there, but just to give a sense of kind of range of outcomes on some of the dilutions that you've got, like I was thinking. $0.10 is kind of ballpark, but I don't know if you'd react to that at all.\nScott Ullem: Yes. Thanks for the question, Travis. In Q3, you're right, we do have a little help from extra selling days in the third quarter. And that's factored into our guidance. It's in the guide that we provided. In terms of dilution from acquisitions, again, we've got to first close the acquisitions, then work on integrating them. Obviously, we spent a lot of time with the plan, but it takes some time, actually, before we actually get businesses inhouse and start recording what kind of financial implications there are before we can report out on those. We'll know a lot more by the end of next quarter when we've actually gotten further down the path, and we'll talk about it then. And of course, we'll give full guidance for EPS in 2025 at our investor conference.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow up on some of your US TAVR commentary and the workflow angle, because I'd like to understand better why you think it's showing up so acutely now, I guess, given you're still in a limited rollout of EVOQUE. Is this an issue that's been matriculating for a while and we're just seeing it more now? And could you help us understand your history there, you talked about the impact on coronaries. How long do you think it'll take for the hospital to adjust. Is this a one quarter or three-quarter issue or it'd take years. What kind of time frame would you put on them adjusting to accommodate the additional workflows?\nLarry Wood: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The thing that I would say is, I guess if I were to draw an analogy, if you had a factory and you saw demand for your product going up, you can always add a little more hours and you always have a little bit of excess capacity. And you can adjust to those things. I think there is just a point in time where you hit a wall, and it's harder to do those things, and I think that's a little bit of what we saw here. It's the cumulative effect of all of these things that have played out over time. If you look at total cath lab procedures for the structural heart team in the last three years is probably close to double during that period of time, which is a lot of growth that these teams are having to absorb and they're having to adapt to, and I think it will take time. And again, when you're starting these new programs, these new therapies, that's the heaviest lift part of it. And again, I think this gets corrected over time, and we'll work closely with the hospitals to do that. But we reflected that in our guidance and just wanted to be realistic and not be tone deaf to what's happened, but on the same thing I'll tell you is none of us are happy with the growth rate. None of us are happy adjusting guidance and we're going to be working as hard as we can to do everything we can to restore the growth to where we think it should be.\nBernard Zovighian: And we are not happy as a company, the patients are not happy, the physician are not happy, the hospital are not happy. So we are fully aligned about it is a problem we need to solve it. So it is why also we are confident here.\nMatthew Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one on, just based on what competition is saying, I know there's been noise on small and light trial. How do you respond to -- this is not competitive dynamics what we're seeing in the US market?\nLarry Wood: Sure. Yeah. We presented our data at New York Valves, and I don't think we've seen the impact of that in any meaningful way. I know some of the smaller competitors have reported, but you have to take their growth rates in consideration of the base they're growing off of versus the base that we're growing off of globally.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe Scott, one for you on the guidance here, EPS, your prior guidance $2.70 to $2.80 inclusive of Critical Care, right, is that still intact or what's the new range? I just want to get an apples-to-apples sort of EPS baseline.\nScott Ullem: It's a fair question. We are not providing a new update. And the reason is because we know Critical Care is going to close sometime late in the third quarter. But as a result, fourth quarter will not include Critical Care. And so, we obviously, looked at a whole bunch of different pro forma scenarios, but it didn't make sense to try to provide some kind of a bridge to the original $2.70 to $2.80 guidance. So, sorry, but we've not given an updated number for the full company just because it's not -- it wouldn't be comparable with Critical Care coming out at the end of the third quarter.\nVijay Kumar: Or is there a comparable like, without Critical Care for the full year, what the underlying number is.\nScott Ullem: Well, the underlying number is actually pretty similar in terms of growth rate with and without Critical Care. And our guidance for the full company is 8% to 10% underlying growth. That's similar, whether it includes Critical Care for the full year or excludes Critical Care for the full year, but we have not translated that down to EPS, with or without.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nPatrick Wood: Fabulous. Thank you so much. Just two quick ones. I guess, on the EVOQUE side and the initial rollout on the clinical feedback and success that you guys have had. How's that been going? There's been a little bit of volatility in the more database. So I'm just curious how the clinician feedback has been.\nDaveen Chopra: Hey, thanks so much, Patrick. This is Daveen. Overall, if you pull back, we've actually been very pleased with the initial rollout of EVOQUE in both the US and Europe. We continue to see really strong physician demand and it really, for us, reinforces the unmet need of these patient group who are looking for better solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing those predictable outcome times. We're seeing it similar to the clinical trials. And just to look at, we're seeing very similar clinical results to what we saw in the clinical trials, specifically from TRISCEND II, So we've been seeing very similar rates there of kind of clinical outcomes. We've seen so far on the journey, especially in Europe now, where PASCAL is actually approved for EVOQUE. We see that it reinforces the need for both the repair and the replacement technology to really treat the maximum number of EVOQUE patients. So overall, we continue to be very excited and happy with where the EVOQUE launch is going.\nPatrick Wood: Very helpful. And then maybe just quickly on Endotronix. I was with Harry and Ariel at THT, and like the conical data on their side looks very interesting. How do you see this fitting into the business overall, because my understanding was that probably this would be initially used for fine-tuning medication management, right? Is this more about building the rolodex patients, so that you know them a little bit better further downstream when it comes to a trans catheter approach. How do you see it strategically fitting in? Thanks.\nBernard Zovighian: Thanks for the question. So let me start big picture with first the patients. We decided to get into this field because we see very largely the patient population needs. Heart failure is one-off, if not the largest driver of healthcare spending in the US. We have known the company for a long time. We were an investor in the company. We believe that they have very unique technology, differentiated technology. As a matter of fact, they received a broad label from FDA last month. There is an NCD ongoing right now, so we see that as a big opportunity, a natural progression for us. If you're asking about -- a very clear strategy about what we are going to do, where we are going to start all of this. It is a little bit early. Again, we expect the closing of the transaction in the third quarter, correct, Scott here. And in December, we will have a full deep dive on the strategy for Endotronix. We believe that many of these patients, are failure patient are patient we are serving and treating today with our valve technologies. So it is in our space. So we are super-excited about it. We see this one as a great opportunity, a great long-term opportunity to expand our reach as a company.\nPatrick Wood: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bernard for any further closing comments.\nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark, and I welcome any additional question by telephone. Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today' teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Sure. Hey, Larry. This is Larry. Thanks for your question. I think at a very high level there needs to be a compelling story for why early intervention is better and basically make the case against watchful waiting. And we've done a lot of work when we were powering the trial, and we obviously had a lot of belief in it. The primary endpoint is death, stroke and rehospitalization. And so, it's really the composite of all those. And winning that trial and obviously, the more you would win it by makes the more compelling case. In terms of the individual components, we'll have to look at those. But when you think about it from the patient journey if they're waiting and bad things are happening to them while they're waiting, and it's resulting in unplanned rehospitalization, or it's resulting in stroke, or it's resulting in mortality, all those are very meaningful things, and that's why they're all composites in the endpoint, so we'll have to wait and see the data, we'll have to see the story, but death, stroke and rehospitalization has kind of become almost a standard now for most of these trials because the clinical community believe these are all important considerations and endpoints. Yes, it's a good question. And I'll defer to Daveen on EVOQUE, but I'll start with the TAVR side of it. It doesn't really change the pricing, and we don't think this is an economically driven thing. I think when new therapies come forward, hospitals are competitive. They want to be able to offer all of the therapies. And that means they want to aggressively start these newer programs and make sure that they can offer all of the options for their patients. And so, I think that's what's driving some of this more than other things. And I think all companies before they're willing to bring a new technology in, they want to -- the center has to demonstrate competence, right? They have to demonstrate they have the ability to screen, they have to have patients in queue and all those things. And I think it becomes a big thing, but I don't think this is an economically driven thing. I think it is just the result of all the new things that are coming into the cath lab and again, I think that does get corrected with time. Yes.

            "content": "[Technical Difficulty] quarter total company sales performance, where TAVR sales growth came in below our expectations. However, it's important to understand broader context, we are pleased that TMTT continues to outperform our expectations. And overall underlying sales growth, including Critical Care was nearly 8%, adjusted EPS was $0.70. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included one-time separation expenses related to the sale of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. So, now I'll cover additional details of our P&L, which reflect total company results, including Critical Care. Note that Critical Care will be presented as a discontinued operation in the 10-Q we will file next week. As we noted in the press release, we'll provide Q4 2024 information reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when we report third quarter results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.1% compared to 77.7% in the same period last year. Last year's second quarter gross profit margin benefited from a more favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. We expect Edwards Q3 adjusted gross profit margin, including Critical Care to be in line with Q2, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Adjusted, selling general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $509 million or 31.2% of sales compared to $469 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of field-based personnel to support growth of our transcatheter therapies, including the launch and rollout of PASCAL and EVOQUE. Adjusted research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 12% over the prior year to $303 million or 18.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 5.2% or adjusted 8.4%. Our unusually favorable non-GAAP rate in the second quarter reflects several positive one-time items that were recorded during the quarter. This unexpected favorability in our tax rate benefited earnings per share by $0.04 in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter adjusted sales growth by 120 basis points or $17.6 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter adjusted gross profit margin by 60 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was reduced $47 million for payments associated with special activities relating to the separation of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $333 million. First half adjusted free cash flow was $539 million. We expect to receive cash from the sale of Critical Care in the third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30. Now I'll finish this update with comments about our previously announced sale of Critical Care, as well as guidance relating to our acquisition announcements. We announced on June 3 that Edwards entered into an agreement to sell Critical Care to BD, and we are planning to close the sale late in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recorded $80 million of one-time costs associated with the sale. Additional one-time costs will be incurred throughout 2024. We expect Q3 sales, including the assumption that we own Critical Care for the full quarter of $1.56 billion to $1.64 billion and Q3 earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. We do not expect the recently announced acquisitions to contribute to Edwards sales in 2024. We intend to provide fourth quarter guidance reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when third quarter results are reported in October. We will also provide 2025 guidance at our Investor Conference in New York on December 4. In the meantime, I'll share a few early expectations for 2025. Next year we expect minimal revenue from acquisitions. While we are planning on incremental operating expenses from these early-stage companies, partially offset by operational efficiencies we plan to realize following the sale of Critical Care. We do not expect increased operating efficiencies to completely offset the loss of profits from the sale of Critical Care in 2025, but we are planning healthy, long-term profit growth. In addition, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet to support continued internal and external investments as well as opportunistic share repurchase. Most importantly, we are confident in the moves we have made to reshape our portfolio of technologies to focus specifically on structural heart. The sale of Critical Care provides extra management bandwidth, as well as additional liquidity to fund external growth investments. And at the same time, our original vision for TMTT is becoming a reality and the early-stage investments we made in companies like JenaValve and Endotronix position us to acquire high-quality and high potential businesses with talented employees. We have other jewels in our portfolio of internal and external investments that will benefit Edwards in the years ahead. Over the long-term, we see an exciting future with expanded opportunities in large and growing market, which we believe will result in sustainable double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. So with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard. All right. That's a multi-part follow up question. Let me try to hit a couple of the things you asked about, Larry. First of all, on the 10% long-term top line growth, we're just not commenting on guidance at this point, it doesn't mean we're increasing it or decreasing it or changing it. It's just the kind of thing where we don't update that during the course of the year, so we're not providing an update today. We will definitely provide an update as we always do at our December investor conference. For dilution from Critical Care. Yes, a lot of this depends upon how we end up prioritizing investments in the company as we separate Critical Care. And as you can imagine, there are a lot of different moving pieces as we do that. So we're not going to be able to give you a specific figure on, I'll call it, remain co, ex-Critical Care at this point. And it does tie to your question about incremental operating expenses that we're absorbing with these acquisitions, and those depend upon a couple of things. One is, when we actually close the acquisitions and start to realize that spending. Two, how we end up integrating them inside of Edwards. And as you can imagine, we just announced them today, so those plans are not completely developed. Finally, in terms of use of proceeds from Critical Care. As you know we're always interested in buying back stock. We're always looking for buying opportunities. But the first call on cash hasn't changed one bit, which is we're going to continue to invest in the company. We're going to continue to invest in the capacity that we need to support the growth of the company. We'll certainly be looking at other external investments. And then finally, we'll look at capital, at allocating capital to share buyback. So there's a little bit of color and we'll obviously give you a lot more as we get towards the end of the year. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Well, obviously we expected growth rate to be higher in Q2 than it was. We had a slow start in Q1, but we were exiting March and we felt good about where we were. So this did come as a surprise. I think when we reflect back on it, and we look more deeply at it, you have to think about all the things that have shown up that are going to the same structural heart team at all of these hospitals. We're seeing rapid growth in mitral repair. We're seeing a lot of growth in other procedures, and we had two new therapy approvals recently in the tricuspid space, and I think a little bit we looked at the procedure volumes and the hospitals have shown a pretty good job of being able to handle these things. We probably underestimated the burden of even starting these new programs, even preparing to start these new programs, because you have to screen the patients early on. There's a lot of learning, screen failures, all of those things, and I think it's just tackling the teams. Now, in terms of things we can do to help, there are certainly things we can do to help. We can do a lot of imaging workups and take some of the load off the team. We can do device prep. We can come in with our benchmark program and teach them efficiencies and do those things. But once a program has been optimized that it really does come down to the hospital to add another team or add additional days and do those sorts of things. So there are some things we can do, but we can't do everything. I think the other thing is, I think highlighting this for the clinicians and we're very confident, this isn't some slowdown because there's a lack of patients. We didn't see any of the fundamentals change in terms of new data that was concerning or any of these things, I think it's just a matter of the workflow right now. And we need to be able to engage with hospitals. But two important things we saw is we saw an increase in time from CT to procedure, which indicates patients are waiting longer and the other thing that we saw was a sharp increase in the number of cases being quoted as emergent versus routine. And I think that speaks to these patients waiting in the queue as these workflow issues sort out. So I think hospitals will certainly do that in time. These patients don't wait well, and we know that there's a lot of them, but we're going to have to continue to work through that with the hospitals. Yes. I mean, it's pretty straightforward which is we're baking into it similar market conditions. The year-over-year calculation is pretty similar. Fourth quarter comp gets a little bit tougher. But we think that all things considered, that 5% of the low end, 7% on the high end captures the likely scenario for the second half combined with the first half that we've already reported. Yes. Thanks for the question, Travis. In Q3, you're right, we do have a little help from extra selling days in the third quarter. And that's factored into our guidance. It's in the guide that we provided. In terms of dilution from acquisitions, again, we've got to first close the acquisitions, then work on integrating them. Obviously, we spent a lot of time with the plan, but it takes some time, actually, before we actually get businesses inhouse and start recording what kind of financial implications there are before we can report out on those. We'll know a lot more by the end of next quarter when we've actually gotten further down the path, and we'll talk about it then. And of course, we'll give full guidance for EPS in 2025 at our investor conference. It's a fair question. We are not providing a new update. And the reason is because we know Critical Care is going to close sometime late in the third quarter. But as a result, fourth quarter will not include Critical Care. And so, we obviously, looked at a whole bunch of different pro forma scenarios, but it didn't make sense to try to provide some kind of a bridge to the original $2.70 to $2.80 guidance. So, sorry, but we've not given an updated number for the full company just because it's not -- it wouldn't be comparable with Critical Care coming out at the end of the third quarter. Well, the underlying number is actually pretty similar in terms of growth rate with and without Critical Care. And our guidance for the full company is 8% to 10% underlying growth. That's similar, whether it includes Critical Care for the full year or excludes Critical Care for the full year, but we have not translated that down to EPS, with or without."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yes, this is Daveen, and I'll just jump in for a second here. We're seeing as we bring in new therapy like EVOQUE, right, while procedure times are relatively efficient, and they are, they're an hour-long procedures. It takes up a lot of energy, effort, thoughts, processes to start a new therapy, right? It takes a lot of bandwidth for people in terms of trying to find the patients, where are the referrals coming from? How does it kind of work through the system? How we pre-case plan? And these are often the same groups of people, valve clinic coordinators, interventional cardiologists, etc. that are working on TAVR. So as you bring in just a new therapy and start building it up, it takes a while, a lot of bandwidth and a lot of energy to get it going. But then over time, like we've seen for every other therapy, you create efficiency. It gets faster, and we're going to help them do that. But hospital then figure out, okay, now this is how the therapy is going to work its way through the system, and it becomes more efficient and becomes better so that there is more capacity to do more procedures overall. This is Daveen. I'll start off a little bit with TMTT. I mean, first, just at a higher level. We were actually super excited to see that in quarter two, our vision becoming more and more reality. We've made a strategic commitment that we need a portfolio of repair and replacement technologies for the many different mitral and tricuspid patients, and it was nice to see that step forward in Q2. Also, when you break it down on the level Q1 sales were led by PASCAL, right. PASCAL is a larger pool. It continues to grow in adoption. We believe in this differentiated premium technology, and it was our largest growth driver. We also did see the early commercial introduction in the US and Europe of EVOQUE, right, EVOQUE got approved in Europe late last year, in the US earlier this year, so we're beginning that important process of training centers getting up to speed, beginning to train our own internal people and start that kind of case cadence. So those were kind of the two. And in terms of size and scale, just because in Europe we've been in Europe since 2019 now that's a much larger base. Since when you have a larger base, you have kind of a stronger growth coming off that, but the US is growing up quickly now. And we're continuing to expand our technologies around the world beyond just the US and Europe. Hey, thanks so much, Patrick. This is Daveen. Overall, if you pull back, we've actually been very pleased with the initial rollout of EVOQUE in both the US and Europe. We continue to see really strong physician demand and it really, for us, reinforces the unmet need of these patient group who are looking for better solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing those predictable outcome times. We're seeing it similar to the clinical trials. And just to look at, we're seeing very similar clinical results to what we saw in the clinical trials, specifically from TRISCEND II, So we've been seeing very similar rates there of kind of clinical outcomes. We've seen so far on the journey, especially in Europe now, where PASCAL is actually approved for EVOQUE. We see that it reinforces the need for both the repair and the replacement technology to really treat the maximum number of EVOQUE patients. So overall, we continue to be very excited and happy with where the EVOQUE launch is going."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us. This afternoon we issued two press releases which the team and I will review in more detail with you now. The first, outlining our Q2 results. And the second, highlighting our acquisition of JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of aortic rehabilitation or AR. And Endotronix, a leader in heart failure management solutions. I will start with our second quarter performance. Total company sales of $1.6 billion increased 8% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. In addition, we made important advancements in our clinical research, new product introductions and efforts by Edwards employees to address the unmet needs of many more patients around the world. TAVR growth in the second quarter was lower than expected, yet we are pleased with the increasingly significant contribution from TMTT. Our vision for TMTT is becoming a reality and our strategic commitment has developed into a growth portfolio of differentiated technology. Overall, Edwards remain well-positioned to deliver strong, sustainable growth. We also announced this afternoon two acquisitions, JenaValve and Endotronix. We have known this company for many years. Discussions with the companies have been ongoing for some time and the timing of these acquisitions coincided with earnings. We are pleased to expand into two new structural heart therapeutic areas, AR and heart failure, and we will leverage our innovation capabilities with worldclass science and clinical evidence to ensure accelerated access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. Now, I will provide some additional detail on Q2 results by product group. In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $1.04 billion increased 6% year-over-year, lower than we planned. Edwards competitive position did not meaningfully change globally, although we experienced some regional pressure, and we maintain pricing. We are confident in our differentiated technology, high-quality evidence and the value we continue to demonstrate to patients, clinicians and the healthcare system. We remain focused on continuing our deep commitment to advancing evidence for AS patients. At the New York Valves meeting in June, we presented additional analysis from the PARTNER trials, which demonstrated excellent clinical outcome up to five years in women and patient with small annuli. Adding to the global body of evidence on the platform, we also anticipate additional data from the RHEIA study to be presented at the upcoming [ESC] (ph) Meeting in London. RHEIA is a prospective randomized study in more than 400 patients across 35 sites in Europe comparing the safety and efficacy of TAVR versus surgery in women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We are actively pursuing significant opportunity to grow TAVR globally over the long-term and are proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for aortic stenosis patient through the progress and early TAVR trials, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. Early TAVR trial results will be presented at TCT this year, and we believe if the data are compelling, it could have a meaningful impact on the timing for patient treatment, while also streamlining referral and patient care for all severe AS patients. In the US, our year-over-year second quarter TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global constant currency growth rate. We believe our US competitive position was largely unchanged. Second quarter, US TAVR sales grew slower than expected. The continued growth and expansion of structural heart therapies, including newly approved tricuspid therapies and other fast-growing structural heart therapies put pressure on hospital workflows, which impacted TAVR. These pressures were also observed in the recent spike in emergent TAVR cases as reflected in claims data. As centers adopt these new therapies and they become part of extended processes, we expect this will stabilize. We know from experience that hospital have historically demonstrated the ability to scale to support transcatheter procedure growth over time. We believe significant undertreatment of severe AS persists, evidence demonstrates that a large number of in-system patients currently go untreated. We are accelerating our efforts to improve referrals and treatment rates for patient already in the hospital system who are suffering from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We recently launched the Edwards ENACT patient activation program, which leverage a comprehensive cardiovascular AI platform and worldclass support to bring real-time insights to TAVR program and improve quality of care for patients. This first of its kind program is focused on streamlining the identification, evaluation and treatment of severe aortic stenosis patient within the hospital system. Outside of the US, in the second quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly above our global TAVR growth. In Japan, we generated double-digit sales growth driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We continue to focus on expanding the ability of this therapy and believe AS remain a significant under threated disease among the substantial elderly population in Japan. In Europe, while share is down slightly on an annualized basis, we were pleased with the momentum, driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We are pleased with high procedure success rate and exceptional patient outcome. We expect the momentum to continue to build as more centers have experienced with the first-choice valve for lifetime management. In closing, we now anticipate second half TAVR sales growth similar to the first half year-over-year growth rate of 5% to 7% full year growth rate versus previously guidance of 8% to 10%. This equate to full year global TAVR sales of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. We believe hospitals are motivated to continue scaling to accommodate increasing volume of transcatheter procedures, which will bring tremendous value to patients and the healthcare system. We remain confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth, driven by our differentiated TAVR portfolio, our deep commitment to advancing patient care for high-quality clinical evidence and new indications and our investment in patient activation initiative. Turning to TMTT. Our deep structural heart expertise has enabled us to significantly advance our portfolio of differentiated technologies, including the PASCAL repair system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system and the SAPIEN M3 mitral replacement system. Our exciting pipeline of innovations is addressing the large unmet needs for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. In Q2, we achieved positive results with sales of $83 million, representing a 75% increase versus the prior year. Q2 sales were led by PASCAL globally and early commercial introduction of EVOQUE in the US and Europe. PASCAL adoption is growing, reflecting its premium differentiation and the value it brings to physician and patients. We believe the mitral tier markets continues to grow double-digit in both the US and Europe. We are excited to bring this therapy to more geographies, more physicians and more patients. The EVOQUE commercial launch continue to progress well. Our disciplined strategy is focused on outstanding patient outcome in centers investing resources required to grow a successful tricuspid program. We are now opening new centers both in Europe and the US after having started with our clinical trial sites. We continue to see strong interest in the therapy, which reflects the significant unmet need in this population of patient who have few options for treatment. Our early real-world commercial experience has demonstrated excellent clinical results. Consistent with those from the TRISCEND II trial. We look forward to presenting the full cohort of TRISCEND II data at the TCT Conference in October. Last month, CMS announced the opening of a national coverage analysis for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement. Since EVOQUE was granted FDA breakthrough status and is utilizing the CMS parallel review process, we believe CMS can move quickly to finalize national coverage. SAPIEN M3 remains on-track to be our first transcatheter mitral valve replacement therapy to gain regulatory approval and launch around the world. We are also pleased to have received a breakthrough designation from the FDA, and we completed enrollment in the mitral annulus classification or MAC arm of our ENCIRCLE study. We now expect SAPIEN M3 to receive CE Mark earlier than previously expected by mid-2025, with FDA approval in the US to follow in 2026. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of JenaValve. JenaValve early-stage technology will add to our growing pipeline of innovative therapy in TMTT and we expect to close the acquisition later this year. We further expect that JenaValve technology combined with Edwards expertise in mitral disease will enhance the company TMVR technologies to address large unmet structural heart patient needs and support sustainable long-term growth. Based on the first half 2024 momentum and the ongoing global adoption of our differentiated technology PASCAL and EVOQUE we are increasing full year sales guidance for TMTT to the higher end of our previous $320 million to $340 million range. We remain confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement therapies for both mitral and tricuspid disease will offer clinician the broader set of options needed to treat this complex and diverse patients. The advancement of our long-term TMTT strategy has positioned us for strong, sustainable growth over many years, driven by a growing portfolio of innovative therapies. In surgical structural heart second quarter sales of $264 million increased 5% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients best treated surgically, including those undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence and have completed enrollment in the US and Canada for our momentous critical trial studying RESILIA performance and the mitral position. MITRIS adoption in Europe is ramping up, and we are pleased to have been granted reimbursement for the device in France earlier than expected. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2024 surgical sales will be 6% to 8% driven by continued adoption of our RESILIA portfolio and growth in overall heart valve surgeries. In Critical Care, second quarter sales were $246 million, which increased 7% versus the prior year. Growth was led by a pressure monitoring devices using the ICU with strong contribution from our SMART Recovery technologies, including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for Swan-Ganz catheter. Critical Care remains focused on driving growth through SMART Recovery and SMART Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decision and get patients home to their family faster. Since announcing the sales of Critical Care to Becton Dickinson in June, our team has made significant progress and we plan to close by late Q3. I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. Turning now to the strategic acquisition of JenaValve and Endotronix. These acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas to address the unmet needs of AR and heart failure patients around the world. Furthermore, the acquisition reflects our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our unique strategy and reinforce our confidence in Edwards sustainable long-term growth. Starting with JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of AR, a deadly disease that impacts more than 100,000 patients in the US alone and is largely untreated today. Edwards anticipate US FDA approval of the JenaValve Trilogy Heart Valve System in late 2025, which will represent the first approved therapy for patient suffering from AR. Edwards will invest to accelerate development of this novel technology to enable earlier patient access. As the pioneers in valve innovation, we believe we are best positioned to lead this next frontier of aortic valve disease treatment. We expect this to be the beginning of a long-term iterative strategy similar to TAVR. Turning to Endotronix. Edwards made its first investment in the company in 2016. So we are very familiar with the technology, the opportunity and the employees. Many structural heart patients Edwards serves today also suffer from heart failure with limited options. This acquisition will expand Edwards structural heart portfolio into a new therapeutic area to address the large unmet needs of patients suffering from heart failure, which we believe has a significant long-term growth opportunity. Last month, Endotronix received FDA approval for Cordella, an implantable preliminary artillery pressure sensor that directly measure the leading indicator of congestion following the publication of a successful US pivotal trial. We are pleased to enter the structural heart therapeutic area with innovation, worldclass science, and clinical evidence to provide access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. We anticipate this investment will strengthen its leadership in structural heart innovation and represent long-term growth opportunity. Minimal revenue contribution from JenaValve and Endotronix is expected to begin late in 2025. As you can tell, we have a lot of positive momentum and many catalysts across our core businesses, TAVR, TMTT and Surgical combined with opportunities to reach new patient population. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. So let me share a few closing thoughts. In TAVR, we have significant opportunities, and we are committed to growing globally by advancing science over long-term, progress and early TAVR trials could fundamentally change how AS patient are treated. In TMTT, our deep expertise has enabled us to significantly advance our exciting portfolio of innovation. And our long-term TMTT strategy has position us for strong, sustainable growth over many years. In surgical structural heart, we continue to see strong global adoption of our premium surgical technologies. Our JenaValve and Endotronix acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas. The buffer presents significant long-term opportunities. We remain confident that our innovative therapy will allow Edwards to treat more patient around the world and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. Our special inclinations increasingly recognize the significant benefit of transcatheter-based technology, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity. With that, I will turn back to Mark. Maybe let me add something to what Larry said. For sure asymptomatic is very important to us and to the community and to patients. But it is one thing of one of the many things we are doing, and we are confident in growing this TAVR opportunity. So asymptomatic is one, patient activation, we see some impact already, but also moderate. So if you think about over the next few years, we see many catalysts. It is why we are confident in this TAVR opportunity. Granted, we know that Q2 was lower than expected, and I guess we are going to talk about it, but in front of us, we see that this opportunity as a big one, like we saw it few years ago, still we see it, still we are confident, and we are doing all the things to realize this opportunity. Larry, on the guidance, I agree with what Scott said about. We are not planning to communicate the guidance on 2025. But if you look at the quarter, TAVR grew about 6%, the company about 8%. So you see a big contribution from TMTT, and we see that contribution to get bigger as we go because right now we are just at the beginning of PASCAL expansion. Just at the beginning of the EVOQUE expansion. We have M3 coming, in TAVR, we have asymptomatic end of the year, so are we confident about sustainable growth over the long-term? Yes. We are going to talk about guidance in December. Yes. So let me add on what Larry said. To be fair, we are contributing a little bit on this pressure. At the same time we are benefiting. If you look at the TMTT growth in the quarter. So we are contributing and benefiting at the same time. Now, big picture, we have seen this picture in the past, don't you think we have seen hospital facing like more to do, more technology to adopt, to be trying on new technologies, and we are very good at scaling. We are very good at learning. We are very good at adapting their workflows in the cath lab, so we believe it is temporary. And we are the real still with this team are, with Larry are partnering on this one. So we are fully focusing on this one helping in real hospital. But we have faith the hospital are going to do that like they did it in the last 10 years. Thanks. We believe, to add on that one, we believe early TAVR, TCT, it will be already almost the end of a quarter, Robbie. So TCT is in late October. So we believe it will have a very minimal impact in Q4. So it is why we didn't want to take too much risk here. Yes, we are confident by experience that the hospital and we do learn fast, adjust their workflow, their processes. And this is why we are seeing it is temporary, obviously, patients when they stay home, they have a terrible quality of life, and many of them are dying, so I don't believe it is sustainable. And everybody is committed. The hospital are committed. We are committed. So when you have a full commitment behind it, we know it is going to be resolved. Yes, I think you said it in your question. We are confident we are not updating the guidance for next year or for 2028 here on the market, but we are confident. We will do so in December at the investor conference in New York. Thank you. And we are not happy as a company, the patients are not happy, the physician are not happy, the hospital are not happy. So we are fully aligned about it is a problem we need to solve it. So it is why also we are confident here. Thanks for the question. So let me start big picture with first the patients. We decided to get into this field because we see very largely the patient population needs. Heart failure is one-off, if not the largest driver of healthcare spending in the US. We have known the company for a long time. We were an investor in the company. We believe that they have very unique technology, differentiated technology. As a matter of fact, they received a broad label from FDA last month. There is an NCD ongoing right now, so we see that as a big opportunity, a natural progression for us. If you're asking about -- a very clear strategy about what we are going to do, where we are going to start all of this. It is a little bit early. Again, we expect the closing of the transaction in the third quarter, correct, Scott here. And in December, we will have a full deep dive on the strategy for Endotronix. We believe that many of these patients, are failure patient are patient we are serving and treating today with our valve technologies. So it is in our space. So we are super-excited about it. We see this one as a great opportunity, a great long-term opportunity to expand our reach as a company. Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark, and I welcome any additional question by telephone. Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day."

These statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. \n Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. \n Finally, unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are also included in today's press release. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments. Bernard? \nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Mark. We are pleased with our total company performance with first quarter sales growth of 10% to $1.6 billion versus the year ago period. As a result, we are raising our 2024 sales guidance to the high end of 8% to 10%. \n As we look ahead, I'd like to share some perspective about the strategic direction of our company. Edwards is well positioned to extend our leadership and deliver sustainable growth, driven by the strategic investments we have made across our transcatheter platforms to address the large and growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease. We remain confident in the many opportunities to grow TAVR over the long term. In addition, TMTT is becoming an increasingly significant contributor to Edwards growth, and we expect this will continue. \n An important element in our valve innovation leadership is our advanced tissue technology. We have been an innovator in tissue technology for more than 50 years and we are pleased with our latest technology, RESILIA. With differentiated evidence of advanced durability, this technology is used across our comprehensive portfolio with a focus on lifetime management of a patient we serve. We are pleased that 0.5 million of patients will benefit from this tissue technology by the end of 2024. \n As the global leader in structural heart, we remain deeply committed to bringing the highest-quality evidence, groundbreaking technology and world-class physician support to advance science and meaningfully improve patient care. This year, we are already making significant progress on multiple clinical trials and next-gen technologies. \n In January, we achieved an important milestone with the completion of patient treatment in progress. A pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large of severe aortic stenosis. In February, EVOQUE became the first transcatheter therapy to receive U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation. EVOQUE is a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to improve quality of life but also shown favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention and heart failure hospitalization. \n In March, at the annual CRT Conference, we announced compelling results from 2 large real-world studies, demonstrating continued excellent outcome for patients treated with the Edwards SAPIEN valve platform. And earlier this month, at the American College of Cardiology Conference, we announced data from the HUDDLE study initiated by Edwards in 2021 with our partner at NFL Alumni Health to study and examine the prevalence of structural heart disease among groups historically known to experience disparities in access to care. Edwards is committed to helping identified and dismantle barriers to access for communities that are underserved due to race, gender and socioeconomic status. \n Each of these reflect our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our differentiated strategy and reinforce our confidence in sustaining the growth of transcatheter-based structural heart intervention. \n Now I will provide some additional detail on Q1 results by product group. In TAVR, first quarter global sales of $1 billion increased 8% year-over-year when adjusted for billing days. Q1 marked the first quarter that Edwards TAVR sales exceeded $1 billion, an exciting milestone for our team and a testament to clinician confidence in our leading technology. Performance was driven by growth in the U.S. and Japan, Edwards' global competitive position and selling prices were both stable. In the U.S., our year-over-year first quarter TAVR sales growth rate was higher than our global constant currency growth rate. We estimate total procedure growth was stable. Procedure volumes increased as the quarter progressed. \n We remain pleased with the continued performance of our best-in-class TAVR platform. SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which build on Edwards' long-standing leadership in tissue technology and durability. This innovative technology now makes up the majority of our sales in the U.S. This platform is supported by the robust real-world data for more than 10,000 patients in the TVT Registry that demonstrated excellent outcomes across hundreds of centers. \n The technologies optimize tissue treatment and is designed to extend durability of a valve, a feature that will be increasingly important as the therapy continues to treat patients with longer life expectancy. We are also proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for AS patients through the progress and early TAVR trials. As discussed in January, we completed enrollment and treatment of patients in progress, approximately 2 years of expectation. We also expect to release the results of early TAVR at the TCT Conference this year. Symptom assessment is one of the most significant barriers to referral and the early TAVR trial evaluates the impact of TAVR on asymptomatic patients with severe AS. We believe if data are compelling, early TAVR may have a meaningful impact on deciding when to treat patients while also streamlining referral and patient care for all severe AS patients. \n Outside of the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global TAVR growth. Strong growth in Japan and the rest of the world was partially offset by slower-than-expected growth in Europe. In Europe, our results were softer than expected in Q1. But we expect full year 2024 performance to normalize. We are actively preparing for the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Europe, and we anticipate introducing the technology into the European market in Q2. \n In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We believe AS remains a significantly undertreated disease among the substantial elderly population and continue to focus on expanding the ability of an evidence supporting this therapy. \n In closing, we are confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth well into the future, driven by our development of differentiated TAVR technology, our deep commitment to advancing patient care through high-quality clinical evidence and our investment in patient activation initiatives. \n Importantly, we are proud of our groundbreaking research into the treatment of AS through our early TAVR and PROGRESS trial, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. We remain confident in our full year TAVR sales growth of 8% to 10%. We expect higher year-over-year second half growth rate than in the first and second quarter. \n Turning to TMTT. We drove positive momentum with our unique and broad portfolio strategy for both repair and replacement therapies for mitral and tricuspid patients. We made significant progress in advancing important technologies, including the PASCAL [indiscernible] system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system and the SAPIEN [indiscernible] replacement system. We are the only company with multiple approved mitral and tricuspid therapies backed by world-class evidence to improve patient care. \n In Q1, we achieved positive results with sales of $73 million, representing a 72% increase versus the prior year. The majority of our Q1 sales were driven by expanded adoption and new site activation of PASCAL, supported by continued double-digit tier market growth in the U.S. and Europe. We are also pleased with strong physician feedback and excellent procedural outcome with the EVOQUE tricuspid valve in both the U.S. and Europe. \n With this replacement technology, we see the unique elimination of tricuspid regurgitation, significant quality of life improvement for patients and favorable trend in all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The increasing physician demand for EVOQUE is a clear indication of unmet need and the potential for this therapy to treat a very large patient population. \n We continue to invest in expanding our high-touch [indiscernible] globally to support this therapy in order to continue to achieve excellent outcome for each patient. Given the strong adoption of our differentiated technology, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we are raising full year TMTT guidance to $320 million to $340 million versus previous guidance, which was the higher end of $280 million to $320 million range. We are confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement options for both mitral and tricuspid will offer clinicians the broad set of therapies necessary to effectively treat many patients in need. This strategy positions us for global leadership, sustainable long-term growth and an increasing contribution to overall Edwards growth. \n In Surgical, first quarter sales of $266 million increased 8% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients, best treated surgically, including for both undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the oral body of evidence in multiple technologies and multiple valves and now expect U.S. and Canada enrollment of our Momentis clinical trial studying RESILIA performance in the mitral position to be completed in Q2 2024, one year ahead of expectation. \n The study will continue to open new sites in Europe and Latin America with global enrollment continuing into 2025. We are now raising our full year surgical sales guidance to 6% to 8% versus expectation of mid-single-digit growth. \n In Critical Care, variability of demand led to better-than-expected first quarter sales of $251 million, which increased 14% versus the prior year, driven by contribution from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery technologies, including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for our [indiscernible] transcatheter and pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU. \n Critical Care remains focused on driving growth through Smart Recovery and Smart Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. We are now confident in raising our full year critical sales guidance to 8% to 10% versus previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Since announcing the spin-off of Critical Care in December, our team has made significant progress, and I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. \n Scott will provide additional details. And now I will turn the call over to Scott. \nScott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Bernard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bernard mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter total company sales performance and progress on our strategic milestones. In addition, we achieved $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 included onetime expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. \n For the second quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.62 billion to $1.70 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. And now I'll cover additional details of our P&L. \n In Q1, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 77.5% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by a more favorable impact from foreign exchange in the prior year. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. \n Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $490 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $436 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives. \n Research and development expense in the first quarter grew 9% over the prior year to $285 million or 17.8% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence for our structural heart disease initiatives, with the goal of treating even more patients. \n Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. Our favorable non-GAAP rate in the first quarter includes a higher-than-expected benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. \n Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 40 basis points or $5 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 160 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on first quarter earnings per share. At current FX rates, we now expect a $70 million or 1% negative impact to full year 2024 sales versus the prior year. \n Regarding the previously announced spinoff of Critical Care, preparations are ongoing. We anticipate completing the unaudited carve-out financial statements next month and we are on track to obtain a tax-free ruling from the IRS by year-end. We are currently assessing capital structure options for the spin-off company, and we plan to share details with investors later this year. \n During the first quarter, we incurred $41 million of onetime costs associated with the spin-off. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024. Free cash flow for the first quarter was reduced by a $305 million deposit, contingent upon the resolution of a tax dispute and $20 million of payments associated with the spin-off of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $206 million, and we continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. \n So before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet of approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. \n And so with that, I'll pass it back over to Bernard. \nBernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. We are pleased with a strong start to the year as we continue to focus on helping even more patients worldwide and driving growth with leading innovative technologies. We remain confident in our increased 2024 financial outlook and look forward to launching breakthrough technologies and progressing multiple important clinical trials, while aggressively investing into our future. \n In closing, we believe Edwards is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth driven by our significant investment focused on structural heart to address the large and growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease. \n With that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A. \nMark Wilterding: Thank you very much, Bernard. We're ready to take questions now. In order to allow for broad participation, we ask that you please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. \n Diego, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great and congrats on a nice quarter. Two for me. I wanted to start first with EVOQUE. Clearly, TMTT had a really strong quarter. It came in well above consensus and some of the most optimistic numbers I was hearing. So I wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing, how much of the TMTT was EVOQUE. And clearly, you raised guidance. I imagine this is just the early stages of adoption here? \nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Robbie. This is a good question. So we are obviously very pleased about the early physician feedback, which has been very, very strong on EVOQUE. We were able to achieve an excellent procedural outcome. Now back to your question about our performance in Q1, very little about EVOQUE. We have seen a very clear momentum on PASCAL, PASCAL in Europe, PASCAL in the U.S. And we are very pleased about our expansion and adoption of PASCAL globally basically. But I'm going to ask Daveen to add some details here. \nDaveen Chopra: Yes. Thanks so much, Bernard. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. And to follow up with Bernard's comments, obviously, the vast majority of our growth came from PASCAL, [indiscernible]. And overall though, we continue to be really pleased with the initial launch of EVOQUE both in Europe and the U.S. Right now, we're just starting to steadily kind of activate sites. We've had really good clinical outcomes, very consistent with what we saw in the clinical trial. And we see really predictable times and predictable procedure times is something that, obviously, physicians really love to see. We see that both at old sites that [indiscernible] as well as new sites that we've opened up kind of in Europe. \n The only thing comment I'll make is it's really early in our journey, but our experience in Europe, especially where we've had PASCAL approved for tricuspid since 2020, really reinforces the fact or the need that we want to have a portfolio of both repair and replacement technologies because tricuspid patients are so complex and so diverse. So I'll stop there. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe a follow-up. I caught the comments that the U.S. TAVR grew faster than the global organic TAVR growth rate and that procedure as accelerated throughout the quarter. So how are you thinking about TAVR growth for the rest of the year? And do you feel like the U.S. has finally recovered after some of the setbacks you saw during the disruptive years of COVID? \nBernard Zovighian: Thanks, Robbie. Let me start, and again, I will ask Larry to add some insights here. So when we put together a guidance for the year, the guidance 8% to 10%, we knew that the growth will ramp throughout the year and that Q1 will be our lowest growth quarter. So we feel we are confident about our 8% to 10%. We feel confident about what's happening in the U.S. Share and price are stable. So we feel good about all of that. \n Larry, you want to add anything? \nLarry Wood: Yes. I don't have a lot to add. We saw good progression throughout the quarter. It's always a little slow in January as we come out of the break, but we are pleased with how the quarter went overall. And we remain excited about the year. We have a lot of activities on patient activation. We have a huge data set coming out of TCT that I think all of us are going to be excited to see what that say, what those data say and how they inform the field. And so I continue to believe we have a long runway long term with TAVR and it is good to see the U.S. kind of out COVID, I think, finally in the rearview mirror, and we can just focus on accelerating patient care. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe on TAVR again, curious why European growth was slower than expected. And then on the billing days, were those U.S. or OUS and those come back in any quarter? \nLarry Wood: Yes, thanks. Yes, overall, we felt good about the quarter, and we just talked about the U.S. We saw a lot of strength in Japan, but Europe was -- it grew year-over-year and it grew sequentially, and we lost a couple of billing days. But even with that, we were a little bit disappointed with our overall growth in Europe. We saw some pretty aggressive pricing from competitors that I think led to some trialing. But we're really excited that we're launching S3UR that actually starts this month, and we're excited to bring that technology to Europe, and we expect these to normalize through the course of the year. \nScott Ullem: I can give a little bit more commentary on the billing days. So outside of the U.S. is where we really felt it. We saw 2 billing days difference in Europe and Japan. Overall, globally, we saw 1 billing day difference. And so it had an impact. To your question about do we see any more impact later in the year? Yes, in Q3, we've got a billing days impact that goes the other direction as well. \nTravis Steed: All right. That's helpful. And then on TAVR and some of that you've been doing with Egnite and kind of helping drive center growth and diagnosis. Curious to see how that's going and at what point do you start to kind of scale those programs out and an impact on -- see the impact on TAVR growth? \nLarry Wood: Yes. We have a lot of patient activation activities where there's a lot of work that we do. We have multiple fronts, and Egnite is just one part of our strategy there. But we're excited about what these technologies can do. And there are so many patients, if you look at the [indiscernible] publication, and I know he's spoken to you guys before, there's just a lot of patients upstream that aren't moving through the system at the speed in which they should. And I think there's a patient identification aspect, there's a referral aspect. \n So we have multiple work streams working on this. But I think the appreciation and understanding for the undertreatment of aortic stenosis is growing. And I think as that grows and people start to understand the magnitude of the problem, I think it gives more opportunity for our patient activation strategy to take hold. \nBernard Zovighian: And maybe in addition, Larry, I'm very proud about what we are doing. We are the only one basically having a deep commitment to advancing science for AS patients through the progress and early TAVR trial. So this is truly our commitment, but we feel that there is a ton of potential. These patients are underdiagnosed [indiscernible],  and we are committed to offer treatment for these patients. So as a company, very proud about how we do all of this. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: I just wanted on TAVR, I wanted to confirm, Bernard, that Q2 TAVR growth will be better than Q1, in response to Robbie's question. And why do you expect TAVR growth to accelerate in the second half? And how are you guys factoring in the SMART trial results? And I have one follow-up. \nLarry Wood: Yes. Yes, we do expect to have procedures to ramp. That's always been a part of our plan, and so we continue to expect that to happen. And I think it's a lot of things, Larry, I think it's a lot of our patient activation work. But it's also just the market continues to improve, and we're very pleased where we finished Q4 last year. We were happy with the ramp in Q1. So I think we do expect to see an increase in Q2 over Q1. But even with that, we expect the second half to have a higher growth rate than the first half. So I think that that's good. \n And as it relates to the SMART trial, I mean, we talked a lot about it at ACC. I think it's just a reminder, and we've talked about this before, but the decision on what valve to use is multifactorial. It's never been about one criteria. It's never been about one data point. And so we continue to have confidence in our platform and the value proposition and with our Ultra RESILIA technology and all the other things that we're doing that we always model in competition, but we feel very good about our platform and our leadership. \nBernard Zovighian: So let me, Larry, let me add something about it. I know that there were plenty of questions about that trial at ACC. I was not at ACC. But our strategy to bring basically groundbreaking science, the highest quality of evidence to help over 1 million of patients who are not being treated today and being able to unlock this large tier market potential, this is what we are doing. This is our strategy. \n So you know us very well. In the last 10 years, we studied 12,000 symptomatic severe aortic patients across mainly FDA-approved studies. And today, again, we are the only company conducting a groundbreaking research into the treatment of AS through early TAVR in progress. So again, I can tell you I'm very proud about who we are as a leader in structural heart disease. I think what happened at ACC [indiscernible] an interesting study more than anything else. \nLarry Biegelsen: And Scott, if I saw correct, you raised the revenue guidance, but you did not change the EPS guidance. Why is that? \nScott Ullem: Yes, that's right. We brought revenue guidance up nearly $150 million, and you're right, we kept our $2.70 to $2.80 range the same. There are a couple of reasons. One was we ended up with a lower tax rate in the first quarter than we expected. Not sure that we're going to be able to maintain that low of a tax rate the rest of this year. The other one is it's just early in the year. And so we'll talk more about how EPS is trending 3 months from now. But we decided at this point early in the year, we just keep it the same. We think the top end of the range can accommodate multiple different scenarios that could play out in the rest of 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: Great. Thank you. I did want to ask a more specific question about the TMTT performance, and you talked about this importance of the portfolio. And so I guess the first way I wanted to ask you was, is EVOQUE, I guess, helping to pull through or improve the performance of PASCAL? And do you expect that as you go through time was even more of a portfolio across mitral and tricuspid to be able to use that portfolio approach to gain even more share.? \nDaveen Chopra: Yes, this is Daveen. I'll answer that. No, honestly, if you look at quarter 1, no, I don't really think there was any significant kind of direct pull-through from EVOQUE versus PASCAL. But if you pull back up, I think us having our portfolio product to treat the maximum number of patients by having repair and replacement technologies for both mitral and tricuspid help show our leadership and that physicians would then want to continue to work with us as leaders in the space. \n I think so there's always going to be a continued kind of link in that way. But when we look at kind of growth opportunities and what's happening for growth overall, if I look at PASCAL, in Q1, we continue to open up new centers. We continue to grow in the centers that we work with and that we continue to gain -- work with physicians more deeply in that way, which I think was fantastic. \n Additionally, and we think that will continue for quarters going into the future. Additionally, we continue to grow geographically, right? There are also countries in the world where we're just kind of bringing PASCAL for the first time. We're in the new kind of the initial stages of where we'll be at PASCAL. So we think that's going to be an important opportunity. And then clearly, that's PASCAL. And number two, EVOQUE, right? We see EVOQUE being a long runway for us of growth across the board. And then we've talked about the future, we will also then bring our M3 -- SAPIEN M3 transcatheter mitral valve to the market, which will add another layer of kind of growth for the future. And I think having all these technologies together really provides a leadership role that we can have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Very nice quarter. I want to spend some time on Critical Care. I can't remember the last time I saw a 14% revenue growth in that segment. And particularly as it's sort of propping to go out on its own, what drove that growth? How sustainable is it? \nBernard Zovighian: Katie, do you want to take that question? \nKatie Szyman: Yes. Thanks, Joanne, for the question. So for Critical Care, as you know, we have capital sales as part of the mix. And so we just see high variability of demand really every quarter across all our product lines. We also have distributor sales that can come up and down. So it was a great quarter for us overall. It's still early in the year. So you saw us raise guidance to 8% to 10%, and we're very confident in that 8% to 10% range. But we don't want to bring it up too much more at this point just because of that variability in demand. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Can you comment on profitability during the quarter? Or should we just hang tight from that one? \nScott Ullem: Profitability for the company, Joanne? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: No, Critical Care, if possible. \nScott Ullem: Let's hold off on product line profitability. Suffice it to say, it was a good top line quarter, and that's helping our bottom line as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC. \n We will move on to the next question. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Just one question on sort of TAVR and transcatheter valve growth, and I'll just keep it to one. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the launch of EVOQUE and the activity that, that drives in some of your major centers. And I guess how you're -- you and the team in the field is kind of managing those activity levels [indiscernible] centers versus the continuing volumes that they perform in TAVR. Just maybe any color or thoughts on how that might play into the total transcatheter business? \n And then Scott, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but if you can possibly quantify the impact on SG&A that you've mentioned about the field resources and sort of patient activation resources that you've planned and are executing on this year? \nLarry Wood: Yes. So I'll start, Matt, and then I'll hand it over to Daveen. This is kind of like what Daveen and I do every day. We partner very closely on these sorts of things. And clearly, as we roll out these new therapies, we want to make sure that people do it with the right volume. And so it's a key part of when we start centers, maybe that they have a whole program that encompasses their entire structural heart patient population. And so our teams work closely together. We have this unique environment where we have very dedicated teams because we want to bring that detailed procedural knowledge and the knowledge of all things related to it. But it still requires a lot of coordination between Daveen and I and we've been doing this for a while. This is true with PASCAL and the launch is there, and it remains [indiscernible]. Daveen? \nDaveen Chopra: Yes. I mean I'll just add maybe some comments about the -- maybe the capacity question that you kind of asked, right? [indiscernible] in mitral repair [indiscernible] technology that's been around for several years and continues to grow with more and more patients being treated. The number of patients being treated and kind of EVOQUE, is relatively small in quarter 1 and for the future just based on these very large, more established numbers of procedures. So for us, overall, I don't necessarily believe that the EVOQUE procedures for any time in the near future are going to affect overall capacity. But I do also -- and to carry on to Larry's point, we collaborate very well together to ensure that when we're opening up a center or working with center for the first time, we're working with that center to ensure that they do have the capacity to then add in these incremental procedures. \nBernard Zovighian: It is fair to say that so far, we have not faced a big challenge in terms of center, having a lack of capacity to be able to treat the patients, whether TAVR patients or EVOQUE patients. \nScott Ullem: And Matt, it's Scott, your question about SG&A. You heard us say in the opening remarks that we're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be around the top end of our original range of 29% to 30%. And that move up a little bit was largely based upon the increased investments that we're making in field resources and patient access initiatives. \n And it also kind of gets to Larry Biegelsen's earlier question about why we didn't move EPS guidance range up yet. We've been waiting to see how sales trended here at the beginning of the year before deciding how aggressively we wanted to go after some of these investment initiatives. And based upon first quarter sales, we're going to move forward with some of those, and that's the reason we're moving up our spending outlook. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. \nShagun Singh Chadha: Sorry about earlier. It just sounds like U.S. TAVR growth was high single digits. Is that fair? Was it about 10%? And other drivers that can get you to consistent double-digit growth in the foreseeable future? Just what's your confidence there? \n And then I wanted to get your take on AHA's Aortic Stenosis initiatives. It seems like they're expanding that to additional centers. And some of our checks have suggested that, that has a positive impact on TAVR volumes. So just anything you can share on that program, the scope of expansion and potential volume impact to TAVR. \nScott Ullem: Yes. I'll take the first part of that about U.S. TAVR growth. We try not to be too specific about breaking down every region. But what we can say is that TAVR in the U.S. grew faster than our global underlying growth rate for TAVR in the first quarter. Larry, do you want to talk about the other pieces? \nLarry Wood: Sure. So the AHA program, we're very excited to partner with the AHA on this. And you're looking for an analog years and years ago, the whole door-to-balloon drive where they created a quality metric that was based on time. And because we know the faster when a patient is having an MI, they get a balloon across that lesion, the survival rate rises dramatically, and it's critical that they do that. \n But for AS, we really don't have any quality initiatives around the time from diagnosis to treatment. And I will say most centers sort of start the clock when the patient ends up with the heart team, and they think they do it pretty quickly. But the part of the story that they miss is the upstream component. From the time that patients got that first echo that they have severe disease, sometimes there's a long journey before the patient actually gets referred to the heart team. And we're trying to do is work on a time metric like door-to-balloon where every patient has to get treated within 90 days of diagnosis. \n And one of the first things that it does is centers have to go back and look at what their own data say. And most centers think they're doing a good job and when they actually dig deep and find their own data, they find out they're not gearing near as well as they thought they were. But if we can get this quality metric implemented, then it would completely change the urgency around patients move through the system. It would be a quality metric they would have to report on. \n So we continue to expand this initiative but the real goal is to make a guideline or quality metric be part of the system where centers would have to report on it. And we think we do that, it could dramatically improve patient care because we know these AS patients do not wait well. They have very high mortality rates. If you go all the way back to [indiscernible], which was the higher risk patients, they had a 50% mortality rate a year when left untreated, and that mortality rate starts very quickly in the process. So we're very excited to partner with AHA, and they're a great partner for us because they have demonstrated expertise in getting these sorts of things put in place. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. \nChristopher Pasquale: First on EVOQUE, you're launching a pretty meaningful price premium to the other technology out there. Do you see the [indiscernible] in October is a gating factor for commercialization? Or do you think you can make significant progress over the next 6 months prior to that incremental reimbursement kicking in? \nDaveen Chopra: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Appreciate it. Yes. So first, just a couple of comments. We really believe that EVOQUE offers exceptional clinical and economic benefit to both patients and health care systems. We think that's a key factor. And we've seen a great increasing interest in demand from physicians to help have this technology to treat their patients. So the results, I think we're going to see continued centers opening up and continued kind of patient growth each quarter.\n If you think about [indiscernible] CMS is actually proposing to move forward [indiscernible]. And then we hope that, as you said, to start October 1. And that helps make up any incremental cost between the cost of EVOQUE procedure versus the existing DRG, which is that DRG for TAVR and TEER. So we think that will continue to add to it. But between now and that, we continue to see a lot of interest from physicians as well center systems because we think this technology does so much for patients. \nBernard Zovighian: Probably fair to say that NTAP will have a big impact next year and after, but not necessarily this year. \nChristopher Pasquale: Okay. And then it sounded like there was a purposeful mention of the commitment fielding both replacement and repair technologies for both tricuspid and mitral and tricuspid, the early consensus from physicians seems to be the replacement is going to lead the way. How are you thinking about which patients might be best served by each technology. And what that means for EVOQUE today and then longer term, how PASCAL could do in tricuspid as CLASP TR gets closer to completing enrollment? \nDaveen Chopra: Yes. This is Daveen again. I'll make a couple of comments on this one. Generally, yes, we are believers that both repair and replacement technology for each valve really helps treat the maximum number of patients. These patients and these disease states are heterogeneous. There's no one magic bullet. There are a lot of patients that continue to need different types of technologies. \n I think all of us, the physician community, the medical community, ourselves, we're all continuing to work and figure out which product repair or replacement is right for what patient. Do we have a clean answer today? No, but we continue to work on it and have some ideas, definitely so. \n With technologies like EVOQUE, we see like this unique elimination of TR, big quality of life improvement. And we see these favorable trends that all cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations, along with a very predictable procedure, very clean kind of times. \n In Europe now, we're starting to have a little -- we already have PASCAL for now a couple of years in Europe PASCAL tricuspid, where people really love PASCAL where it has some really great features for the tricuspid valve, really atraumatic [indiscernible], et cetera. But physicians there are starting to see how EVOQUE makes a lot of sense for certain segments of their patients. \n So no, we haven't quite figured out the exact mix of these patients, but we know both are really important for treating the most patients. \nBernard Zovighian: Maybe I will add something. About 6, 7 years ago, we believed that having repair and replacement for both mitral and tricuspid was going to be important. Today, we are confident that indeed it is the case. And this will provide physician options to treat many patients and to best select what therapy for what patient. So if you're asking what exactly the technology for that patient, I think it is still early. We still -- we need probably more time, more research to do that. But for sure, I think this portfolio puts basically a physician in a driver seat to make the best decision for their patient, which is what we wanted initially. And as a result, this is going to unlock this very large opportunity and we are going to see a sustainable growth from TMTT in the years to come. \nDaveen Chopra: And I'll leave it up on your comment about kind of the clinical data, right? And that's why it's so important that we continue to enroll in trials like CLASP II TR. So that's our tricuspid trial, right? It's a randomized study where getting more data and understanding how these different technologies can really help patients. It's super important for ourselves. So not only post-market studies for EVOQUE but also these other randomized studies, pre-market studies that are so important to collect this data to continue to understand where these technologies can work best for patients. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. \nPito Chickering: A follow-up to Chris' question. I just want to make sure that I heard that you expect limited EVOQUE sales until the NTAP kicks in October 1. And with G&A, at the high end of your previous guidance to 3%,  how many centers will be ready to perform the procedure by that date? \nDaveen Chopra: So this is Daveen. On the NTAP comment, we believe right now, each quarter, we continue to open up new centers. We continue to train physicians on it, and it's a steady state, nice growth and providing the technology to more patients. And we've seen a lot of demand from physicians for this technology for these patients. \n I think to Bernard's point, NTAP adds a continued allowance of growth as it gets to more scale, that will really help support 2025 and 2026 growth. And then the second question was -- I missed the second part of your question. \nScott Ullem: I mean, I think the question was how many centers do you think we'll be ready to do procedures once the NTAP is active. And I think what we can say is, certainly, the sites that have been involved in clinical trialing are going to be ready to activate beyond that. We're just going to be strategic and deliberate about where we activate. \nDaveen Chopra: And we're going to focus on centers that are already the higher-volume tricuspid centers that have their infrastructure set up, have their right side imaging set up. So it's going to be just a steady kind of growth [indiscernible] moving to other high-volume tricuspid centers. \nPito Chickering: Okay. And [indiscernible] indication, if that trial is positive to get FDA approval, is that going to be exclusive to SAPIEN? And any color on how much creep you've seen, if any, for docs treating asymptomatic patients today? \nLarry Wood: Yes, thanks. Well, none of us know the trial results as yet. That won't happen until later this year. So if the trial is positive and obviously, the more positive trial is, the more benefit that you get from it. But I think it's really about how patients get referred for therapy. And I think that, that's going to be the key thing. So I think it speaks to the treatment in referral for aortic stenosis and the time frame we should do that more than a specific therapy. \n Now that being said, it is a randomized trial against the SAPIEN platform. And so if you're going to think about treating patients earlier, you're going to have a platform that delivers outstanding clinical outcomes, right? You're going to have to have those low mortality rates. And this is where we think our platform really shines because, if you look at, again, our PARTNER 3 low-risk data, we had 99% survival rate at one year. We had 90% survival rate at 5 years and very low complication rates. And that's probably more in line with the patient population that would be asymptomatic, is really more towards a lower-risk patient population. And we're the only one to make the investments in that trial at this point. So -- but I do think it speaks to the deadliness of the disease broadly. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. \nRichard Newitter: Going back to the trend in Europe and your confidence and visibility to a recovery there for your business. I guess, is it more that you just -- you think the price discounting is going to ease? And because you have RESILIA coming in that region, it will offset and that's the acceleration? Or is there -- what else can you tell us that gives you confidence there? \nLarry Wood: Yes. We had a good Q4 in Europe. And so this does feel like it's probably more temporary, and it's something that we're going to put a little bit more focus on. We do sell at a premium in Europe and some people were pretty aggressive with discounting. And I think we have to beat that with our value proposition and with new technology. And we're super excited [indiscernible] the U.S. at this point and Japan, it's a brand-new product for Europe. They have no experience with it. So we're excited because it's the only platform in anywhere that has the RESILIA technology. And again, this is something that's been on our market-leading surgical valves for -- we're probably approaching a decade now. \n So it's a huge milestone for us to be able to get this technology into Europe. And we do think that physicians still are going to make their long-term product decision based on what's best for their patients. \nRichard Newitter: Okay. And following up here on just the selling days. I think you said, Scott, in 3Q, the billing days go the other way, positive for you. Order of magnitude similar to 1Q and then same geographic impact or anything you want to add there? \nScott Ullem: Sure. In the third quarter, order of magnitude, same thing. It's about a day globally and geographically, very similar. Europe or Eastern Europe a day or 2 days, everywhere else a day. So it's really a day across the board in the third quarter. \nRichard Newitter: Okay. So more evenly split by region? \nScott Ullem: Yes, most of the regions are one day in the third quarter, whereas in the first quarter, we had Europe and Japan at 2 days, but I'm not sure that level of precision is that important. Suffice it to say, in aggregate, in total, it's a day in the first quarter, and the day in the third quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a good start to the year. Larry, I was hoping -- I appreciate this whole initiative, the patient acquisition initiative. Working to get patients treated. You guys talked about at your Analyst Day and on the Q4 call, the AI, the utilization of AI and some piloting at some centers. And I was wondering if you could give any color on how much faster you're seeing growth at those centers, if at all yet, if you can quantify that? Just to get a sense of like if this does get implemented more broadly, what it could -- what we could see from a growth perspective? \nLarry Wood: Yes. I appreciate the question, Danielle. It's a little hard to quantify. We're still putting some of these systems in place. And remember, it's not just identifying the patients. People have to start [indiscernible] the way patients get referred and the way they come in. And so I think we're really, really pleased with the pilots that we've run in the places that we've gone. We very clearly identify that there's an upstream population that many of the centers didn't even know existed. And now how we tap into those, how we move those patients through the system, how they add capacity to address these patients. That's where the pilot centers are kind of in that phase now. But we -- when I spoke of this in the investor conference, we have, in our minds, 100% validated the undertreatment of aortic stenosis. We've done it in enough centers with enough different people. It's been backed by enough publications, really even leading academic programs. Now it's a matter of going through all of the steps to get these patients off the sidelines and get the proper therapy. \n And -- but this is going to be something -- it's not a day -- one day, there's going to be this massive step function. It's going to be this continued effort over time. But again, it's going to be the thing that drives our growth over, I think, a very extended period of time. \nDanielle Antalffy: Sure. And I guess just one quick follow-up on TAVR plus asymptomatic. I mean you talked a little bit about this at the Analyst Day, but asymptomatic almost more about easing workflow and decision-making processes. I mean, asymptomatic, assuming the trial [indiscernible] plus this initiative, I mean, should we see growth acceleration specifically in TAVR in 2025? I know you're not going to give '25 guidance, but I thought I'd try. \nLarry Wood: Yes. I'm not going to get into guidance, and I really want to be cautious not to speculate on trials that are in flight. We'll see the data at TCT. And after we see that data, then I'll be happy to talk about what I think the repercussions are and how I think it plays out. \n What I can tell you is the patient journey right now is a complicated one. Patients get diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis. And then they had this [indiscernible] layer on top of it, which is do you have symptoms, are the symptoms attributable to aortic stenosis, are the symptoms enough to refer you for care. And there's a number of patients, even though the guidelines say any symptoms or cost for referral, there's a large number of patients that are being held upstream because somebody has decided the symptoms aren't significant enough. \n So instead of this being a mathematical equation, it sort of turns into almost Olympic figure skating with all this judgment. And when you end up with older people that have more comorbidities, that gets even more confusing and more challenging. If asymptomatic is successful and we have a powerful trial there, then it should simply move to track and field. It should just be a matter of if your aortic stenosis goes below 1.0, you should immediately be referred to a heart team for care. And I think that streamlining of care is going to be what makes the difference and takes a lot of the noise out of the system. \nDanielle Antalffy: Thanks so much. Love those analogies. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: I was hoping to ask about SAPIEN X4 and just thinking about the design and the ability to provide, I think, 16 different deployment diameters. I mean should investors be optimistic and clinicians that we could see lower gradients and a lower [indiscernible] mismatch rate with the SAPIEN X4 relative to the SAPIEN 3 Ultra or SAPIEN 3 system. And -- or is it really just the benefit for a future TAVR and TAVR that, that sizing action will provide? \nLarry Wood: Yes. That's a great question, Josh. And clearly, you're deep on our platform and the details. I think the concept of this variable sizing is really being able to tailor our valve to the patient, rather than driving the patient to a nominal, we can adjust our valve and make it different. \n As it relates to hemodynamics, we presented data at TRT that showed the improvements that we made with S3UR with the RESILIA tissue, we saw a pretty significant reduction in gradient. And so if you need a copy of that presentation, I'm sure Mark can get it to you. So we've already made a lot of those enhancements to our UR platform and X4 is a RESILIA platform as well. So we would expect those benefits to be there as well. \nJoshua Jennings: Great. And then just to follow up on just the TAVR and TAVR replacement cycle. I think when that really fully kicks in is TBD based on durability. But I would love to just hear your thoughts on TAVR and TAVR as the, I guess, more prominent choice for a second procedure and this lifetime management of severe aortic stenosis patients... \nLarry Wood: The -- our platform with its frame design and its coronary access is really the ideal platform for that second procedure but it's also the ideal platform to use in that second procedure. I think a valve needs to be a good host but it needs to be a good guest, and that's, I think going to be critically important. \n We -- if you go all the way back to the PARTNER I trials that are older now, those patients were 83 years old at the time of implantation. We're just sort of probably getting into that range now where [indiscernible] TAVR is just kind of probably start hitting a little bit of an inflection point in the next couple of years. And I think as time goes by, that is going to be a bigger part of the story. But again, we think our platform is very well suited for that and it's good for patients. \n The idea that if you have [indiscernible] make up a number, 10 years of durability, but they can get a second procedure and get another 10 or 15 years of durability out of it, you have equivalent of 25-year durability without a patient having to have an open-heart procedure. And I think that's incredibly powerful for patients. \nJoshua Jennings: And just to finish the piece, Larry, just on -- if surgery becomes kind of, I guess, the more prominent second procedure option of using TAVR first segment. I mean, your positioning on the surgical side is very strong, too, with KONECT RESILIA, but maybe just your thoughts there. \nLarry Wood: For sure. I think our surgical platform plays well into that as well. \nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we've run out of time for questions. I'll now hand it back to Bernard Zovighian for closing remarks. \nBernard Zovighian: Thank you so much. Thanks, everyone. I want to close with offering some big-picture comment about the quarter. Obviously, we are very pleased about the strong performance for the company growing 10%. And when you think about it, this is the result of the strategy we put in place years ago. What we have today is a diversified portfolio with TAVR, mitral tricuspid and surgical, all of them contributing to the performance of the company. \n TAVR, for sure, it is the largest business for us. It's still our #1 focus. TAVR has a lot of growth potential. But mitral and tricuspid are now contributing in a very meaningful manner for the performance of the company. So it is why we are so confident longer term that we are going to deliver a sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year with all of the catalysts we are having. \n Again, thanks for your interest. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Scott and Mark or myself. Have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. Participants may disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Larry Wood",
            "content": "Yes. I don't have a lot to add. We saw good progression throughout the quarter. It's always a little slow in January as we come out of the break, but we are pleased with how the quarter went overall. And we remain excited about the year. We have a lot of activities on patient activation. We have a huge data set coming out of TCT that I think all of us are going to be excited to see what that say, what those data say and how they inform the field. And so I continue to believe we have a long runway long term with TAVR and it is good to see the U.S. kind of out COVID, I think, finally in the rearview mirror, and we can just focus on accelerating patient care. Yes, thanks. Yes, overall, we felt good about the quarter, and we just talked about the U.S. We saw a lot of strength in Japan, but Europe was -- it grew year-over-year and it grew sequentially, and we lost a couple of billing days. But even with that, we were a little bit disappointed with our overall growth in Europe. We saw some pretty aggressive pricing from competitors that I think led to some trialing. But we're really excited that we're launching S3UR that actually starts this month, and we're excited to bring that technology to Europe, and we expect these to normalize through the course of the year. Yes. We have a lot of patient activation activities where there's a lot of work that we do. We have multiple fronts, and Egnite is just one part of our strategy there. But we're excited about what these technologies can do. And there are so many patients, if you look at the [indiscernible] publication, and I know he's spoken to you guys before, there's just a lot of patients upstream that aren't moving through the system at the speed in which they should. And I think there's a patient identification aspect, there's a referral aspect. \n So we have multiple work streams working on this. But I think the appreciation and understanding for the undertreatment of aortic stenosis is growing. And I think as that grows and people start to understand the magnitude of the problem, I think it gives more opportunity for our patient activation strategy to take hold. Yes. Yes, we do expect to have procedures to ramp. That's always been a part of our plan, and so we continue to expect that to happen. And I think it's a lot of things, Larry, I think it's a lot of our patient activation work. But it's also just the market continues to improve, and we're very pleased where we finished Q4 last year. We were happy with the ramp in Q1. So I think we do expect to see an increase in Q2 over Q1. But even with that, we expect the second half to have a higher growth rate than the first half. So I think that that's good. \n And as it relates to the SMART trial, I mean, we talked a lot about it at ACC. I think it's just a reminder, and we've talked about this before, but the decision on what valve to use is multifactorial. It's never been about one criteria. It's never been about one data point. And so we continue to have confidence in our platform and the value proposition and with our Ultra RESILIA technology and all the other things that we're doing that we always model in competition, but we feel very good about our platform and our leadership. Yes. So I'll start, Matt, and then I'll hand it over to Daveen. This is kind of like what Daveen and I do every day. We partner very closely on these sorts of things. And clearly, as we roll out these new therapies, we want to make sure that people do it with the right volume. And so it's a key part of when we start centers, maybe that they have a whole program that encompasses their entire structural heart patient population. And so our teams work closely together. We have this unique environment where we have very dedicated teams because we want to bring that detailed procedural knowledge and the knowledge of all things related to it. But it still requires a lot of coordination between Daveen and I and we've been doing this for a while. This is true with PASCAL and the launch is there, and it remains [indiscernible]. Daveen? Sure. So the AHA program, we're very excited to partner with the AHA on this. And you're looking for an analog years and years ago, the whole door-to-balloon drive where they created a quality metric that was based on time. And because we know the faster when a patient is having an MI, they get a balloon across that lesion, the survival rate rises dramatically, and it's critical that they do that. \n But for AS, we really don't have any quality initiatives around the time from diagnosis to treatment. And I will say most centers sort of start the clock when the patient ends up with the heart team, and they think they do it pretty quickly. But the part of the story that they miss is the upstream component. From the time that patients got that first echo that they have severe disease, sometimes there's a long journey before the patient actually gets referred to the heart team. And we're trying to do is work on a time metric like door-to-balloon where every patient has to get treated within 90 days of diagnosis. \n And one of the first things that it does is centers have to go back and look at what their own data say. And most centers think they're doing a good job and when they actually dig deep and find their own data, they find out they're not gearing near as well as they thought they were. But if we can get this quality metric implemented, then it would completely change the urgency around patients move through the system. It would be a quality metric they would have to report on. \n So we continue to expand this initiative but the real goal is to make a guideline or quality metric be part of the system where centers would have to report on it. And we think we do that, it could dramatically improve patient care because we know these AS patients do not wait well. They have very high mortality rates. If you go all the way back to [indiscernible], which was the higher risk patients, they had a 50% mortality rate a year when left untreated, and that mortality rate starts very quickly in the process. So we're very excited to partner with AHA, and they're a great partner for us because they have demonstrated expertise in getting these sorts of things put in place. Yes, thanks. Well, none of us know the trial results as yet. That won't happen until later this year. So if the trial is positive and obviously, the more positive trial is, the more benefit that you get from it. But I think it's really about how patients get referred for therapy. And I think that, that's going to be the key thing. So I think it speaks to the treatment in referral for aortic stenosis and the time frame we should do that more than a specific therapy. \n Now that being said, it is a randomized trial against the SAPIEN platform.

And I think that's incredibly powerful for patients. For sure. I think our surgical platform plays well into that as well."

            "name": "Scott Ullem",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Bernard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bernard mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter total company sales performance and progress on our strategic milestones. In addition, we achieved $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 included onetime expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. \n For the second quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.62 billion to $1.70 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. And now I'll cover additional details of our P&L. \n In Q1, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 77.5% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by a more favorable impact from foreign exchange in the prior year. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. \n Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $490 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $436 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives. \n Research and development expense in the first quarter grew 9% over the prior year to $285 million or 17.8% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence for our structural heart disease initiatives, with the goal of treating even more patients. \n Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. Our favorable non-GAAP rate in the first quarter includes a higher-than-expected benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. \n Foreign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 40 basis points or $5 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 160 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on first quarter earnings per share. At current FX rates, we now expect a $70 million or 1% negative impact to full year 2024 sales versus the prior year. \n Regarding the previously announced spinoff of Critical Care, preparations are ongoing. We anticipate completing the unaudited carve-out financial statements next month and we are on track to obtain a tax-free ruling from the IRS by year-end. We are currently assessing capital structure options for the spin-off company, and we plan to share details with investors later this year. \n During the first quarter, we incurred $41 million of onetime costs associated with the spin-off. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024. Free cash flow for the first quarter was reduced by a $305 million deposit, contingent upon the resolution of a tax dispute and $20 million of payments associated with the spin-off of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $206 million, and we continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. \n So before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet of approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. \n And so with that, I'll pass it back over to Bernard. I can give a little bit more commentary on the billing days. So outside of the U.S. is where we really felt it. We saw 2 billing days difference in Europe and Japan. Overall, globally, we saw 1 billing day difference. And so it had an impact. To your question about do we see any more impact later in the year? Yes, in Q3, we've got a billing days impact that goes the other direction as well. Yes, that's right. We brought revenue guidance up nearly $150 million, and you're right, we kept our $2.70 to $2.80 range the same. There are a couple of reasons. One was we ended up with a lower tax rate in the first quarter than we expected. Not sure that we're going to be able to maintain that low of a tax rate the rest of this year. The other one is it's just early in the year. And so we'll talk more about how EPS is trending 3 months from now. But we decided at this point early in the year, we just keep it the same. We think the top end of the range can accommodate multiple different scenarios that could play out in the rest of 2024. Profitability for the company, Joanne? Let's hold off on product line profitability. Suffice it to say, it was a good top line quarter, and that's helping our bottom line as well. And Matt, it's Scott, your question about SG&A. You heard us say in the opening remarks that we're expecting SG&A as a percentage of sales to be around the top end of our original range of 29% to 30%. And that move up a little bit was largely based upon the increased investments that we're making in field resources and patient access initiatives. \n And it also kind of gets to Larry Biegelsen's earlier question about why we didn't move EPS guidance range up yet. We've been waiting to see how sales trended here at the beginning of the year before deciding how aggressively we wanted to go after some of these investment initiatives. And based upon first quarter sales, we're going to move forward with some of those, and that's the reason we're moving up our spending outlook. Yes. I'll take the first part of that about U.S. TAVR growth. We try not to be too specific about breaking down every region. But what we can say is that TAVR in the U.S. grew faster than our global underlying growth rate for TAVR in the first quarter. Larry, do you want to talk about the other pieces? I mean, I think the question was how many centers do you think we'll be ready to do procedures once the NTAP is active. And I think what we can say is, certainly, the sites that have been involved in clinical trialing are going to be ready to activate beyond that. We're just going to be strategic and deliberate about where we activate. Sure. In the third quarter, order of magnitude, same thing. It's about a day globally and geographically, very similar. Europe or Eastern Europe a day or 2 days, everywhere else a day. So it's really a day across the board in the third quarter. Yes, most of the regions are one day in the third quarter, whereas in the first quarter, we had Europe and Japan at 2 days, but I'm not sure that level of precision is that important. Suffice it to say, in aggregate, in total, it's a day in the first quarter, and the day in the third quarter."

            "name": "Daveen Chopra",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks so much, Bernard. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. And to follow up with Bernard's comments, obviously, the vast majority of our growth came from PASCAL, [indiscernible]. And overall though, we continue to be really pleased with the initial launch of EVOQUE both in Europe and the U.S. Right now, we're just starting to steadily kind of activate sites. We've had really good clinical outcomes, very consistent with what we saw in the clinical trial. And we see really predictable times and predictable procedure times is something that, obviously, physicians really love to see. We see that both at old sites that [indiscernible] as well as new sites that we've opened up kind of in Europe. \n The only thing comment I'll make is it's really early in our journey, but our experience in Europe, especially where we've had PASCAL approved for tricuspid since 2020, really reinforces the fact or the need that we want to have a portfolio of both repair and replacement technologies because tricuspid patients are so complex and so diverse. So I'll stop there. Yes, this is Daveen. I'll answer that. No, honestly, if you look at quarter 1, no, I don't really think there was any significant kind of direct pull-through from EVOQUE versus PASCAL. But if you pull back up, I think us having our portfolio product to treat the maximum number of patients by having repair and replacement technologies for both mitral and tricuspid help show our leadership and that physicians would then want to continue to work with us as leaders in the space. \n I think so there's always going to be a continued kind of link in that way. But when we look at kind of growth opportunities and what's happening for growth overall, if I look at PASCAL, in Q1, we continue to open up new centers. We continue to grow in the centers that we work with and that we continue to gain -- work with physicians more deeply in that way, which I think was fantastic. \n Additionally, and we think that will continue for quarters going into the future. Additionally, we continue to grow geographically, right? There are also countries in the world where we're just kind of bringing PASCAL for the first time. We're in the new kind of the initial stages of where we'll be at PASCAL. So we think that's going to be an important opportunity. And then clearly, that's PASCAL. And number two, EVOQUE, right? We see EVOQUE being a long runway for us of growth across the board. And then we've talked about the future, we will also then bring our M3 -- SAPIEN M3 transcatheter mitral valve to the market, which will add another layer of kind of growth for the future. And I think having all these technologies together really provides a leadership role that we can have. Yes. I mean I'll just add maybe some comments about the -- maybe the capacity question that you kind of asked, right? [indiscernible] in mitral repair [indiscernible] technology that's been around for several years and continues to grow with more and more patients being treated. The number of patients being treated and kind of EVOQUE, is relatively small in quarter 1 and for the future just based on these very large, more established numbers of procedures. So for us, overall, I don't necessarily believe that the EVOQUE procedures for any time in the near future are going to affect overall capacity. But I do also -- and to carry on to Larry's point, we collaborate very well together to ensure that when we're opening up a center or working with center for the first time, we're working with that center to ensure that they do have the capacity to then add in these incremental procedures. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Appreciate it. Yes. So first, just a couple of comments. We really believe that EVOQUE offers exceptional clinical and economic benefit to both patients and health care systems. We think that's a key factor. And we've seen a great increasing interest in demand from physicians to help have this technology to treat their patients. So the results, I think we're going to see continued centers opening up and continued kind of patient growth each quarter.\n If you think about [indiscernible] CMS is actually proposing to move forward [indiscernible]. And then we hope that, as you said, to start October 1. And that helps make up any incremental cost between the cost of EVOQUE procedure versus the existing DRG, which is that DRG for TAVR and TEER. So we think that will continue to add to it. But between now and that, we continue to see a lot of interest from physicians as well center systems because we think this technology does so much for patients. Yes. This is Daveen again. I'll make a couple of comments on this one. Generally, yes, we are believers that both repair and replacement technology for each valve really helps treat the maximum number of patients. These patients and these disease states are heterogeneous. There's no one magic bullet. There are a lot of patients that continue to need different types of technologies. \n I think all of us, the physician community, the medical community, ourselves, we're all continuing to work and figure out which product repair or replacement is right for what patient. Do we have a clean answer today? No, but we continue to work on it and have some ideas, definitely so. \n With technologies like EVOQUE, we see like this unique elimination of TR, big quality of life improvement. And we see these favorable trends that all cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations, along with a very predictable procedure, very clean kind of times. \n In Europe now, we're starting to have a little -- we already have PASCAL for now a couple of years in Europe PASCAL tricuspid, where people really love PASCAL where it has some really great features for the tricuspid valve, really atraumatic [indiscernible], et cetera. But physicians there are starting to see how EVOQUE makes a lot of sense for certain segments of their patients. \n So no, we haven't quite figured out the exact mix of these patients, but we know both are really important for treating the most patients. And I'll leave it up on your comment about kind of the clinical data, right? And that's why it's so important that we continue to enroll in trials like CLASP II TR. So that's our tricuspid trial, right? It's a randomized study where getting more data and understanding how these different technologies can really help patients. It's super important for ourselves. So not only post-market studies for EVOQUE but also these other randomized studies, pre-market studies that are so important to collect this data to continue to understand where these technologies can work best for patients. So this is Daveen. On the NTAP comment, we believe right now, each quarter, we continue to open up new centers. We continue to train physicians on it, and it's a steady state, nice growth and providing the technology to more patients. And we've seen a lot of demand from physicians for this technology for these patients. \n I think to Bernard's point, NTAP adds a continued allowance of growth as it gets to more scale, that will really help support 2025 and 2026 growth. And then the second question was -- I missed the second part of your question. And we're going to focus on centers that are already the higher-volume tricuspid centers that have their infrastructure set up, have their right side imaging set up. So it's going to be just a steady kind of growth [indiscernible] moving to other high-volume tricuspid centers."

            "name": "Bernard Zovighian",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We are pleased with our total company performance with first quarter sales growth of 10% to $1.6 billion versus the year ago period. As a result, we are raising our 2024 sales guidance to the high end of 8% to 10%. \n As we look ahead, I'd like to share some perspective about the strategic direction of our company. Edwards is well positioned to extend our leadership and deliver sustainable growth, driven by the strategic investments we have made across our transcatheter platforms to address the large and growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease. We remain confident in the many opportunities to grow TAVR over the long term. In addition, TMTT is becoming an increasingly significant contributor to Edwards growth, and we expect this will continue. \n An important element in our valve innovation leadership is our advanced tissue technology. We have been an innovator in tissue technology for more than 50 years and we are pleased with our latest technology, RESILIA. With differentiated evidence of advanced durability, this technology is used across our comprehensive portfolio with a focus on lifetime management of a patient we serve. We are pleased that 0.5 million of patients will benefit from this tissue technology by the end of 2024. \n As the global leader in structural heart, we remain deeply committed to bringing the highest-quality evidence, groundbreaking technology and world-class physician support to advance science and meaningfully improve patient care. This year, we are already making significant progress on multiple clinical trials and next-gen technologies. \n In January, we achieved an important milestone with the completion of patient treatment in progress. A pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large of severe aortic stenosis. In February, EVOQUE became the first transcatheter therapy to receive U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation. EVOQUE is a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to improve quality of life but also shown favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention and heart failure hospitalization. \n In March, at the annual CRT Conference, we announced compelling results from 2 large real-world studies, demonstrating continued excellent outcome for patients treated with the Edwards SAPIEN valve platform. And earlier this month, at the American College of Cardiology Conference, we announced data from the HUDDLE study initiated by Edwards in 2021 with our partner at NFL Alumni Health to study and examine the prevalence of structural heart disease among groups historically known to experience disparities in access to care. Edwards is committed to helping identified and dismantle barriers to access for communities that are underserved due to race, gender and socioeconomic status. \n Each of these reflect our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our differentiated strategy and reinforce our confidence in sustaining the growth of transcatheter-based structural heart intervention. \n Now I will provide some additional detail on Q1 results by product group. In TAVR, first quarter global sales of $1 billion increased 8% year-over-year when adjusted for billing days. Q1 marked the first quarter that Edwards TAVR sales exceeded $1 billion, an exciting milestone for our team and a testament to clinician confidence in our leading technology. Performance was driven by growth in the U.S. and Japan, Edwards' global competitive position and selling prices were both stable. In the U.S., our year-over-year first quarter TAVR sales growth rate was higher than our global constant currency growth rate. We estimate total procedure growth was stable. Procedure volumes increased as the quarter progressed. \n We remain pleased with the continued performance of our best-in-class TAVR platform. SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which build on Edwards' long-standing leadership in tissue technology and durability. This innovative technology now makes up the majority of our sales in the U.S. This platform is supported by the robust real-world data for more than 10,000 patients in the TVT Registry that demonstrated excellent outcomes across hundreds of centers. \n The technologies optimize tissue treatment and is designed to extend durability of a valve, a feature that will be increasingly important as the therapy continues to treat patients with longer life expectancy. We are also proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for AS patients through the progress and early TAVR trials. As discussed in January, we completed enrollment and treatment of patients in progress, approximately 2 years of expectation. We also expect to release the results of early TAVR at the TCT Conference this year. Symptom assessment is one of the most significant barriers to referral and the early TAVR trial evaluates the impact of TAVR on asymptomatic patients with severe AS. We believe if data are compelling, early TAVR may have a meaningful impact on deciding when to treat patients while also streamlining referral and patient care for all severe AS patients. \n Outside of the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global TAVR growth. Strong growth in Japan and the rest of the world was partially offset by slower-than-expected growth in Europe. In Europe, our results were softer than expected in Q1. But we expect full year 2024 performance to normalize. We are actively preparing for the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Europe, and we anticipate introducing the technology into the European market in Q2. \n In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We believe AS remains a significantly undertreated disease among the substantial elderly population and continue to focus on expanding the ability of an evidence supporting this therapy. \n In closing, we are confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth well into the future, driven by our development of differentiated TAVR technology, our deep commitment to advancing patient care through high-quality clinical evidence and our investment in patient activation initiatives. \n Importantly, we are proud of our groundbreaking research into the treatment of AS through our early TAVR and PROGRESS trial, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. We remain confident in our full year TAVR sales growth of 8% to 10%. We expect higher year-over-year second half growth rate than in the first and second quarter. \n Turning to TMTT. We drove positive momentum with our unique and broad portfolio strategy for both repair and replacement therapies for mitral and tricuspid patients. We made significant progress in advancing important technologies, including the PASCAL [indiscernible] system, the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system and the SAPIEN [indiscernible] replacement system. We are the only company with multiple approved mitral and tricuspid therapies backed by world-class evidence to improve patient care. \n In Q1, we achieved positive results with sales of $73 million, representing a 72% increase versus the prior year. The majority of our Q1 sales were driven by expanded adoption and new site activation of PASCAL, supported by continued double-digit tier market growth in the U.S. and Europe. We are also pleased with strong physician feedback and excellent procedural outcome with the EVOQUE tricuspid valve in both the U.S. and Europe. \n With this replacement technology, we see the unique elimination of tricuspid regurgitation, significant quality of life improvement for patients and favorable trend in all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The increasing physician demand for EVOQUE is a clear indication of unmet need and the potential for this therapy to treat a very large patient population. \n We continue to invest in expanding our high-touch [indiscernible] globally to support this therapy in order to continue to achieve excellent outcome for each patient. Given the strong adoption of our differentiated technology, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we are raising full year TMTT guidance to $320 million to $340 million versus previous guidance, which was the higher end of $280 million to $320 million range. We are confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement options for both mitral and tricuspid will offer clinicians the broad set of therapies necessary to effectively treat many patients in need. This strategy positions us for global leadership, sustainable long-term growth and an increasing contribution to overall Edwards growth. \n In Surgical, first quarter sales of $266 million increased 8% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients, best treated surgically, including for both undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the oral body of evidence in multiple technologies and multiple valves and now expect U.S. and Canada enrollment of our Momentis clinical trial studying RESILIA performance in the mitral position to be completed in Q2 2024, one year ahead of expectation. \n The study will continue to open new sites in Europe and Latin America with global enrollment continuing into 2025. We are now raising our full year surgical sales guidance to 6% to 8% versus expectation of mid-single-digit growth. \n In Critical Care, variability of demand led to better-than-expected first quarter sales of $251 million, which increased 14% versus the prior year, driven by contribution from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery technologies, including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for our [indiscernible] transcatheter and pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU. \n Critical Care remains focused on driving growth through Smart Recovery and Smart Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. We are now confident in raising our full year critical sales guidance to 8% to 10% versus previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Since announcing the spin-off of Critical Care in December, our team has made significant progress, and I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication. \n Scott will provide additional details. And now I will turn the call over to Scott. Thank you, Scott. We are pleased with a strong start to the year as we continue to focus on helping even more patients worldwide and driving growth with leading innovative technologies. We remain confident in our increased 2024 financial outlook and look forward to launching breakthrough technologies and progressing multiple important clinical trials, while aggressively investing into our future. \n In closing, we believe Edwards is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth driven by our significant investment focused on structural heart to address the large and growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease. \n With that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A. Thanks, Robbie. This is a good question. So we are obviously very pleased about the early physician feedback, which has been very, very strong on EVOQUE. We were able to achieve an excellent procedural outcome. Now back to your question about our performance in Q1, very little about EVOQUE. We have seen a very clear momentum on PASCAL, PASCAL in Europe, PASCAL in the U.S. And we are very pleased about our expansion and adoption of PASCAL globally basically. But I'm going to ask Daveen to add some details here. Thanks, Robbie. Let me start, and again, I will ask Larry to add some insights here. So when we put together a guidance for the year, the guidance 8% to 10%, we knew that the growth will ramp throughout the year and that Q1 will be our lowest growth quarter. So we feel we are confident about our 8% to 10%. We feel confident about what's happening in the U.S. Share and price are stable. So we feel good about all of that. \n Larry, you want to add anything? And maybe in addition, Larry, I'm very proud about what we are doing. We are the only one basically having a deep commitment to advancing science for AS patients through the progress and early TAVR trial. So this is truly our commitment, but we feel that there is a ton of potential. These patients are underdiagnosed [indiscernible],  and we are committed to offer treatment for these patients. So as a company, very proud about how we do all of this. So let me, Larry, let me add something about it. I know that there were plenty of questions about that trial at ACC. I was not at ACC. But our strategy to bring basically groundbreaking science, the highest quality of evidence to help over 1 million of patients who are not being treated today and being able to unlock this large tier market potential, this is what we are doing. This is our strategy. \n So you know us very well. In the last 10 years, we studied 12,000 symptomatic severe aortic patients across mainly FDA-approved studies. And today, again, we are the only company conducting a groundbreaking research into the treatment of AS through early TAVR in progress. So again, I can tell you I'm very proud about who we are as a leader in structural heart disease. I think what happened at ACC [indiscernible] an interesting study more than anything else. Katie, do you want to take that question? It is fair to say that so far, we have not faced a big challenge in terms of center, having a lack of capacity to be able to treat the patients, whether TAVR patients or EVOQUE patients. Probably fair to say that NTAP will have a big impact next year and after, but not necessarily this year. Maybe I will add something. About 6, 7 years ago, we believed that having repair and replacement for both mitral and tricuspid was going to be important. Today, we are confident that indeed it is the case. And this will provide physician options to treat many patients and to best select what therapy for what patient. So if you're asking what exactly the technology for that patient, I think it is still early. We still -- we need probably more time, more research to do that. But for sure, I think this portfolio puts basically a physician in a driver seat to make the best decision for their patient, which is what we wanted initially. And as a result, this is going to unlock this very large opportunity and we are going to see a sustainable growth from TMTT in the years to come. Thank you so much. Thanks, everyone. I want to close with offering some big-picture comment about the quarter. Obviously, we are very pleased about the strong performance for the company growing 10%. And when you think about it, this is the result of the strategy we put in place years ago. What we have today is a diversified portfolio with TAVR, mitral tricuspid and surgical, all of them contributing to the performance of the company. \n TAVR, for sure, it is the largest business for us. It's still our #1 focus. TAVR has a lot of growth potential. But mitral and tricuspid are now contributing in a very meaningful manner for the performance of the company. So it is why we are so confident longer term that we are going to deliver a sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year with all of the catalysts we are having. \n Again, thanks for your interest. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Scott and Mark or myself. Have a great day. Thank you."
