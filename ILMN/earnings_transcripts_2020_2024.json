With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Juliet. Good afternoon everyone. Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million, was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing Instruments grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. We also booked the second highest NovaSeq units during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the August launch of our V1.5 reagents. V1.5 resulted in higher new customer growth, as well as additional HiSeq conversions. NovaSeq continues to be the market-leading sequencer as it enters its fifth year since launch. Full year 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9% year-over-year with the largest impact from the pandemic in the second quarter. Our business accelerated in the second half of the year, growing 17% compared to the first half. In 2020, we shipped more than 2,000 sequencing systems, set another record for mid-throughput shipments and added more than 700 new customers, which exceeded our expectations. I\u2019d like to share some fourth quarter highlights by platform, starting with our high-throughput systems. NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year at over $1.2 million per instrument. We expect NovaSeq pull-through to continue at pre-pandemic levels of $1.1 to $1.2 million per year in 2021. The NovaSeq v1.5 reagent introduction is catalyzing a new wave of high-throughput customers as the $600 genome became a reality for labs of any size. In fact, over half of our NovaSeq system orders in 2020 were to new high throughput customers. This includes customers like Argentina\u2019s Ministry of Health, who purchased NovaSeq for infectious disease research. The V 1.5 introduction also accelerated the purchasing timeline for CellCarta, a contract research organization and a new-to-high throughput customer, who plans to use their NovaSeq to support oncology clinical trials. The V 1.5 reagents are also strengthening the economic case for legacy HiSeq customers to upgrade, like the University of Oregon, who is using NovaSeq for large, single cell and epigenetics studies. We ended the year with about 1,000 active HiSeq units and in 2021, we expect continued HiSeq to NovaSeq adoption among the 320 customers yet to transition. Moving to mid-throughput, 2020 marked the second consecutive year of record placements, and the mid-throughput segment continues to provide durable growth in our core business. Fourth quarter strength was primarily driven by the successful launches of NextSeq 1000 and 2000, which also drove an increase in mid-throughput consumable revenue for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect continued NextSeq expansion in 2021, particularly in the clinical segment. Notably, we received NMPA approval in China for NextSeq Dx, driving demand in local hospitals in applications like oncology and infectious disease testing. We expect this approval to drive NextSeq Dx placements and further increase our clinical presence in 2021. We added more than 500 new low-throughput customers in 2020, bringing our total to more than 6,100 customers worldwide. Our platforms hold the largest set of flow cell configurations and enable the most expansive set of supported methods with run times as fast as five hours. In the fourth quarter, we had record low-throughput consumable revenue driven by customers like Invitae, who has products in development using the MiSeq Dx. I\u2019ll now provide updates on our Clinical and Research and Applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $2 billion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on academic and research institutions. By the fourth quarter of 2020, clinical sequencing run-rates actually exceeded pre-pandemic levels and research run-rates also returned to normalized pre-pandemic volumes. It was great to see how our customers successfully rebounded under these challenging circumstances. More than 43% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2020 were to clinical customers, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health, and genetic disease. Clinical testing proved durable during the pandemic with clinical consumables growing about 8% year-over-year to approximately $890 million in 2020. And in the fourth quarter, clinical consumables growth accelerated to over 20% year-over-year. In clinical, I\u2019ll highlight first the tremendous progress made in market access and reimbursement. We believe recent landmark coverage decisions will drive greater adoption of next-generation sequencing to new levels over the next several years. In oncology, 205 million lives are now covered for tumor comprehensive genomic profiling in the U.S., and with an increasing number of targeted oncology therapies, we expect CGP to grow to be a $1 billion plus market by 2026. Additionally, Germany recently started covering tumor CGP and whole exome and whole genome for rare and undiagnosed genetic disease without restrictions. This means that 73 million lives will have better access to CGP and whole exome and whole genome testing. In reproductive health, with multiple large payors expanding coverage for all pregnancies, we expect NIPT coverage in the U.S. to exceed three million pregnancies by the end of 2021. And finally, whole genome sequencing coverage for genetic disease testing increased 10-fold in 2020 and we expect WGS to become the standard of care in genetic disease as awareness and reimbursement continues to grow. With these positive reimbursement trends as a backdrop, I\u2019ll now discuss our clinical focus areas in a little more detail. Oncology testing continues to represent approximately 20% of total sequencing consumables, and it grew year-over-year driven by companies like Guardant Health, who expanded its mobile phlebotomy services to help patients access its Guardant360 liquid biopsy test during the pandemic. This also includes Genomic Hubs in the NHS that adopted NovaSeq comprehensive genomic profiling as the standard of care in the UK, and oncology centers like Florida Cancer Specialists, a private community oncology and hematology practice with nearly 100 offices throughout Florida. Florida Cancer Specialists purchased multiple NextSeq Dx systems in 2020 to run Illumina\u2019s Trusight Oncology 500 assay in its new lab. Reproductive health represented about 12% of sequencing consumables, with revenue and samples for our end-to-end VeriSeq NIPT solution growing over 20% in 2020. Lastly, about 10% of our sequencing consumables revenue is related to genetic disease testing. Customers continue to choose Illumina\u2019s highly accurate and scalable sequencers as their platform of choice in this area. For example, the recent collaboration between Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in partnership with the New York Genome Center, will use Illumina technology for clinical WGS in areas like cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Turning to our Research and Applied segment, revenue of approximately $1.2 billion represented just under 57% of our sequencing consumable shipments and was lower by about 6% year-over-year as customers were impacted by the pandemic. Research accelerated in the second half, growing 20% compared to the first half as researchers returned to their labs. This segment includes research in oncology and genetic disease, as well as population genomic and research initiatives. Our sequencers enable programs like KDNA, a large scale Korean project aiming to sequence 1 million genomes by 2030. A service provider consortium, standardized on Illumina technology, won the competitive tender based on NovaSeq\u2019s superior technical evaluation. The program plans to complete its 7,500-genome Phase 1 by the end of the year. The NHS commenced a phased rollout for whole genome sequencing in the fourth quarter for selected rare disease and cancer patients as part of their routine care. Once this live clinical testing phase is complete, we expect the whole genome sequencing service to further ramp in the spring. We expect the All of Us program to continue to scale this year, and the NIH anticipates releasing de-identified data from 100,000 sequenced and array genotyped samples to its research portal by the end of 2021. Finally, as a leading innovator, Illumina remains steadfast in the defense of our intellectual property globally. We received injunctions against BGI for patent infringement in the U.S., Germany, UK, Spain, Sweden and Finland. We remain confident that our IP portfolio affords strong protection for Illumina\u2019s innovations now and well into the future. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam.\nSam Samad: Thank you, Francis. As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million, driven by 1% growth in sequencing offset by an 8% decline in microarrays. Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846 million, which represented 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and grew 19% sequentially. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 5% compared to the prior year period and 20% sequentially. Sequencing instruments revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and grew 29% sequentially and sequencing service and other was down 15% compared to the prior year period due to IVD partnership revenue recognized last year. Moving to regional results, the Americas revenue grew 14% sequentially. Revenue in the region was 2% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by one-time technology access fees for an IVD partnership and lower DTC revenue. These items were partially offset by sequencing consumables. The Americas had record sequencing product revenue in the fourth quarter, driven by clinical customers. EMEA delivered record revenue of $285 million, representing 34% sequential growth and 2% growth year-over-year driven by strong instrument revenue from NovaSeq. We also saw certain customers in emerging countries taking their first NovaSeq shipments. Greater China grew 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year to $96 million and had its highest sequencing instrument revenue quarter since 2017, driven in part by growing demand in hospitals. Subsequent to Q4, we also announced the Sequoia Capital China Genomics Incubator, which builds on our other incubator efforts in Silicon Valley and the U.K. together. We will partner with leading entrepreneurs in China to build genomics startup companies to create breakthrough genomics applications and clinical sequencing solutions. Finally, APJ revenue of $77 million was up 24% sequentially and up 5% from the prior year period. For the full year, the region was roughly flat compared to 2019 with full year growth in sequencing consumables. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today\u2019s release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. As expected, non-GAAP gross margin of 66.9% decreased approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was down 330 basis points primarily due to a one-time inventory write down in Q4, one-time IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, and higher freight costs related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $439 million were up $74 million sequentially, as expected, reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter, variable compensation expenses and other investments. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, down from 21.4% in the third quarter. Non-GAAP other income of $20 million was $13 million higher sequentially due to gains on short term investments sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.4% was up from last quarter due to a discrete charge related to a tax structure initiative in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase of our tax rate in Q4 was also impacted by discrete tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $257 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $179 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items: Cash flow from operations was $406 million. DSO of 50 days compared to 53 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $62 million and free cash flow was $344 million. We repurchased $280 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance: We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 17% to 20% or $3.79 billion to $3.89 billion representing an increase of approximately $599 million at the midpoint. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 20%; this includes sequencing consumable growth of around 20%; we expect sequencing system revenue to grow 33% year-over-year driven by placements of NovaSeq due to continued HiSeq conversions, and the adoption of V 1.5 reagents, as well as placements of NextSeq due to NextSeq 2000 and Dx demand; and Arrays to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to modestly improve from 2020 reflecting increased leverage from higher volumes and cost saving initiatives partially offset by product mix, and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 24%. As volumes increase and freight charges normalize, we expect both gross and operating margins to improve in the second half of 2021 and be above the full year average. We expect other income to be about $40 million lower than 2020 due to the gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest rates, and shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $5.01, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.35. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 147 million. Moving to the first quarter of 2021: We are raising our previous expectations, and we now expect high-single digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin; sequential decline in non-GAAP operating expenses similar to historical seasonality; non-GAAP other income to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the one-time gain on short term investments previously discussed; and as a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2021. We\u2019re seeing strength in our core business and are playing an essential role in the emerging surveillance effort necessary to fight the pandemic. In the past couple of months, as new, more dangerous SARS-Cov-2 variants have emerged, there has been a growing recognition of the need for COVID surveillance around the globe, with countries like U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany leading the way in deploying national surveillance infrastructures. In the U.S., the proposed budget package, contains $1.75 billion for the CDC to conduct, expand, and improve activities to sequence genomes, identify mutations, and survey the transmission of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Sequencing-based surveillance is one of the key elements in the fight against this pandemic, and it\u2019s also becoming clear that sequencing and surveillance are becoming mainstream in the defense against infectious disease. This global surveillance infrastructure being built right now will be instrumental in identifying future outbreaks \u2013 including coronaviruses, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. Illumina is proud to be at the forefront of this important work. We\u2019d also like to congratulate Nobel Laureate and Illumina Board member, Dr. Frances Arnold, who was named as CoChair of the U.S. President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. We believe the recent appointments of highly experienced scientists signal the Administration\u2019s focus on science, including genomics, to improve life in the U.S. for everyone. Finally, we continue to expect to close the GRAIL acquisition in the second half of this year, enabling us to help accelerate the adoption of early cancer detection screening, and open up the largest application for genomics by far. We are looking forward to GRAIL launching Galleri in Q2. We see a vast number of opportunities ahead of us and there has never been a more exciting time to be in genomics at Illumina. Now, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a two-part question, Francis. I guess the first one really for Sam was just on the earnings guidance for next year. It includes a substantial amount of OpEx spending and really not getting much leverage. So I'm hoping you can walk through that a little bit because the initial guide kind of surprised us. And then secondarily, I was hoping that you could walk through in terms of your sequencing guidance for next year, Francis, in terms of the NovaSeq success that you've had thus far. Of the remaining HiSeq existing customers that haven't converted, can you give a little more color kind of what's baked in, in terms of the new V1.5 launch? And how many of those you expect to convert? And that's kind of what's impacted in your guidance? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Dan. So this is Sam. Hope you are doing well. So let me talk a little bit about the EPS guide of [indiscernible] for this year. Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there. And part of that is a one time also impact related to stock-based compensation. We talked about at JPMorgan when we provided the guide, which is related to two plans for the 19 and 20 plans that were significantly impacted by the pandemic. And that we are modifying the targets on those plans. So that has a one-time catch up expense in 2021 of approximately $50 million to $55 million. And that's really a significant portion of the OpEx growth. Beyond that, we're continuing to invest behind our platforms, behind our technologies, behind our assays. So which we are committed to R&D is a big commitment for us. As we look forward Dan, our goal is to continue to improve in terms of the leverage on our operating margin to get back to traditional operating margin levels that we had back in 2019, which were close to 30%, that will take some time to get back to, but that's a commitment that we have is to continue to drive operating leverage by making sure that we're very actively focused on G&A investments and reducing or making sure that those continue to grow beyond the rate of growth in revenues. But then we continue to invest in R&D and to some extent, commercial as well. But we are committed over the long-term to get back into operating leverage. And in fact, in the second half as well of the year, as we get past the pandemic, the second half, we expect to see an improvement in terms of both gross margin and operating margin versus the first half and definitely higher than the full year as well for gross margin and operating margin.\nFrancis deSouza: Super. Thanks, Sam. So Dan I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a lot of momentum on NovaSeq. The version 1.5 NovaSeq reagents that we released in August really did a nice job in terms of unlocking the elasticity of demand in that high throughput segment of the market. And so as we talked about coming into this year, we're coming off Q4 where in our first quarter of selling the version 1.5 reagents. NovaSeq consumables had a record quarter, growing in the mid-teens year-over-year. So really strong from consumables perspective. And we talked about the fact that in Q4 we also had our second highest order in terms of bookings orders for NovaSeq and the first highest was when we first launched NovaSeq back in 2017. So both from a \u2013 an instruments perspective and a consumables perspective, we're coming off a really strong Q4, and we're walking into this year with a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog following the orders that came in Q4. So as we think about this year Dan, there are two sources of demand we see for NovaSeq. One, and we talked about this in Q4 also that we're seeing \u2013 because of 1.5, really an unlocking demand from new to high throughput customers. And if you think about in Q4, over half the bookings went to new to high throughput customers. So again that new pricing is opening up the market for new customers to come in. And the other source of demand for NovaSeq coming into this year is the remaining HiSeq customers. And as we pointed out, there are \u2013 of our original HiSeq base, we still have 320 customers that have yet to begin the upgrade cycle. And now with the lower pricing on 1.5, these typically smaller core labs now have a NovaSeq accessible to them. And if you look at the pricing now, all it takes for a HiSeq 2,500 customer is for them to run about four high output gets a month, and they can justify the list price of a NovaSeq in a year. In addition, with the 1.5 release, we extended the shelf life of the consumables from three months to six months, so they don't have to sequence as frequency to justify the upgrade. And then finally, the new 35 cycles as four kits also enables counting methods now on the NovaSeq, which was important to those labs. So you add all those in, and we're walking into this year with strong momentum on the NovaSeq side, and that's what we expect to drive orders this year. In fact, we're expecting another strong year of NovaSeq orders coming into 2021.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. A couple of quick ones here. On the fourth quarter, was there any consumable stocking? We just hear about that your peers last night. And then how much of the record order book was catch up spending versus, Francis, what you just talked about, the acceleration and adoption driven by the flow sale? And then I'm curious why margins were so soft. You did have the price adjustments, the inventory write-down, stock-based comp, but it seems like maybe there was more there. I'm curious if you're kind of pulling forward any spending. And then secondly, shifting to the outlook, it's good to see you're stepping up the first quarter guidance here versus what you gave at our conference. I'm just curious if there was something that changed in your outlook, the original guidance down 9% to 10% obviously, didn't really make a ton of sense. So this is more of what I think people had been expecting anyway. But I'm curious what drove that. And then Francis, more broadly, I'm wondering if you can comment on the surveillance opportunity. Just how material you think that could be? And how much of that do you think ends up getting done on short versus long rate? Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yes, so may be I will cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront Tycho, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there. So hopefully, I'll capture everything here. But in terms of Q4 stocking, we had a very strong quarter in Q4. We did not see any unusual stocking beyond what you see traditionally at the year end. I mean, there's usually a reset of budgets at the end of Q4, academic budgets at the end of the year. So beyond what we usually see every year, we have not seen any unusual stocking in Q4. And we validate this by looking at basically activity on our sequencers. We look at the activity, the data that we have, looking at all the active sequencers that we have that are connected. And in fact, we saw a strong increase in terms of activity levels in Q4 in terms of clinical, getting back and showing growth pre-pandemic levels, and in terms of research now going basically at pre-pandemic levels. So pleased to see that and \u2013 which validates that there wasn't any unusual stocking at the end of Q4. In terms of gross margin, I think we talked about the drivers, Tycho. I mean we're still impacted by the pandemic. Freight is still a factor for us in Q4. We did have the onetime write-down on certain inventory, which was approximately a percentage point impact negatively on gross margin. And mix was an impact as well in Q4 because we had strong instruments in the quarter as well. So those are the things that impacted margins in Q4. We expect margins to improve in Q1, to progressively improve across 2021. And in the second half in fact to be, as I said earlier, above the full year average. And starting to get back to our \u2013 what we call our normal levels of 70% plus \u2013 not quite at 70%, but close to that in the second half. So we definitely see that as we start to get out of the constraints driven by the pandemic, and which resulted in higher freight and other higher expenses. With regards to Q1 outlook, we are pleased to be raising our Q1 outlook based on what we're seeing. We're seeing strength in the business. We're seeing strength in activity levels. Again, too early to comment specifically, it's been four weeks since the start of the year. But everything that we're seeing in terms of orders is really encouraging. So we are pleased with where the business has started.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Let me build on \u2013 yes let me build on Sam's remark. So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1, given what we shared at JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan what we shared was very typical for our business and other players in our business, which is sequentially from Q4 to Q1 because of the capital cycle, you expect a decrease in revenue. And that's what we called. And we said, look, you should expect us to be flat to Q1 of last year. But we're seeing a lot more strength even in the first few weeks of the quarter. And that strength is coming from our core business, as Sam said, and we're monitoring both \u2013 not just orders, but we're monitoring activity levels. And exiting Q4 and into Q1 we are seeing strong activity levels both from the clinical side of the business, but also on the research side of the business. And so as we stand here, it's become clear to us that instead of being flat to a year ago, we're going to be up high single digits. And so we're coming pretty close to where we were in Q4. That's unusual in this business, but it really speaks to the strength that we're seeing in terms of orders coming in. Obviously, there's a lot of the year left. And so we're leaving the year guidance intact, but certainly strength in Q1. In terms of surveillance, surveillance is something we've been talking about now for about a year. And the idea is that, in addition to rolling out testing infrastructure to fight this pandemic, you will need surveillance infrastructure to understand how the virus is spreading geographically and how it's mutating. And that information about mutations are essential to understand that the tools we're using to fight the pandemic, the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies will continue to be effective. And really once the outbreak we started to see around Christmas of the B117 variants in the U.K. and then the South African variants that started to really get people realized that we do need the surveillance infrastructure. So then contribute much in terms of revenue in Q4 and we only built in a modest amount in Q1, but you can see the activity, right? You can see the activity in CoG-UK, you can see the activity in countries around the world, in France, in Germany, Italy, and Spain and Greece, sort of around the world. And we expect that to continue over the course of this year, as countries build out these surveillance infrastructures, and that's going to be a durable surveillance infrastructure. We\u2019re going to need it in the future to warn us of the next pandemic, to warn us of bioterrorist attacks, anti-microbial resistance. And what's interesting is that Illumina's technology is uniquely well-suited for this need. And the reason for that is because, we have unmatched accuracy, we can deliver with the highest scale, we can deliver the price point per sample that's necessary and we also have the first cleared product for customers to use. And so those things came together and you'll see that playing out in the numbers, right. So right at the very beginning, we were the sequencer used in Wuhan and then in Shanghai to publish the first viral genome. It was the Illumina sequencing data that was used by the vaccine developers to develop the vaccines, the MRA vaccines are being used today. And that was because of the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing. And now, as you look at the large-scale initiatives, CoG-UK, and some of the other ones, it's Illumina\u2019s sequencers that's being used because of the scale that we can achieve, and the throughput, and the turnaround time. And so, you look at the numbers of the genomes in Jessa, for example, and you will see that the vast majority of the data, and Jessa, the vast majority of the genomes that have been sequenced have been done on Illumina sequencers. And so very exciting, very important, starting now.\nOperator: Your next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Let me just rattle through them real quick. On NovaSeq utilization, NovaSeq consumables pulled through on an annualized basis, I believe, was above 1.2 million in the fourth quarter. I believe your expectation for 2021, at least in terms of what\u2019s embedded into guidance is 1.1 to 1.2 per box. I'm just wondering, what's driving the assumption for slightly lower utilization versus Q4, keeping in mind that there was no abnormal stocking in Q4? There's a couple of things I could think of, maybe it's just early in the year, uncertainty, especially as we're coming out of the pandemic. Maybe it's the expectation for a lot more boxes being placed, which can pressure pull through at least initially on an average basis. And/or it could have something to do with the v1.5 reagent pricing having an impact. So, some detail on that assumption would be helpful. And then the second thing I wanted to talk about was just GRAIL. Do you expect PATHFINDER data in Q1, is that still the case? When would you expect to initiate registration studies? And can you share anything in terms of progress being made with self-insured employers, closed healthcare systems and/or concierge systems? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes, thank you, Doug. This is Sam. Maybe I'll start with your pull-through question and then I'll let Francis talk to GRAIL. Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head with the comments that you made around pull through. I mean, we had a very, very, I would say, strong pull-through in Q4 in terms of $1.2 million per instrument, we were back to above pre-pandemic levels, actually at the high end of the guidance range in terms of pre-pandemic levels. We do expect with the v1.5 that you will have \u2013 that it will catalyze significant HiSeq conversion with those 320 remaining HiSeq customers. So those will start to also transition to NovaSeq. That has, I would say, a very modest impact on pull-through, on the downside, but also you have the large centers that will drive, pull-through higher on the upside.  But as you said, we're still in a pandemic year. The first six months of the year are expected to still be basically a pandemic reality, so to speak. And at this point, I think, it's prudent that the guidance that we have and the expectation that we have is the $1.1 million to $1.2 million range. We're very encouraged by what we saw in Q4.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, now if I could add on the GRAIL side. So, no new update. So that means GRAIL is on track, with its PATHFINDER results, as they said at JP Morgan in their announcement for Q1 and they are on track for a gallery launch in Q2. We know they are making progress with both health systems and self-insured employers. They haven't announced anything yet, but I know, for example, we are marching down the path at Illumina to make the GRAIL test available to our employees in the second half of this year. And as part of that process, our team has been engaged with other employers that are also in process with them. The big announcement, obviously from the health system side was the announcement around the NHS and that's tracking for the pilot to be launched this year. And as a reminder, that's 165,000 tests that they've committed to doing with the intent, then assuming that goes well, to do a million tests in 2024, and then do a population wide rollout.\nOperator: Your next question is from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: 20% sequencing consumable growth this year, just trying to understand a little bit in terms of \u2013 you are pointing out number of growth drivers here, easy comps obviously, new chemistry, $600 genome discount that we saw in the fourth quarter, that's obviously driving elastic demand here, as you would have expected. There is increase in COVID sequencing, COVID variance, that's coming in, there's post-pandemic instrumentation buys and cancer patients potentially returning back as they get vaccinated in 2021 here. And MRD and screening, and those trials are ramping up too. So just wanting to understand sort of why the conservatism is at 20% given all that of a backdrop? And then I also wanted to understand \u2013 well, first of all, I appreciate you providing the roadmap details in terms of product improvements that you expect. But wondering how should we look at that in light of a customer event that you have coming up there? And then lastly, if I could also touch on MRD that's been a new focus area for GRAIL. So, there are already two competitors in the place in the market there. So how do you position into that market? And also, how do you \u2013 what's your expectation in terms of those other competitors are obviously, they are running samples on Illumina sequencers too. So, what's your expectation for the MRD market here, acceleration over the next one to three years? I appreciate you taking these questions. Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes, thanks Puneet. Hope you're doing well. So, this is Sam. I'll start with the sequencing consumable question, and then I'll let Francis comment on the roadmap question in the MRD one as well. So, we are expecting 20% sequencing consumable growth this year for a number of reasons there are some very good tailwinds in the business and strengthen in the core business that drive us to that. As you mentioned, additional market access and coverage for both on the NIPT side, on the genetic disease side, we're seeing definitely growth in the comprehensive genomic profiling on the oncology side, the v1.5 is a great introduction. The COVID variance part Puneet, we have not really assumed a significant impact of that in our guides, that's something that we're really encouraged by in terms of the surveillance aspect. We are seeing definitely strength from that, but again, a bit early to really size that for the full year. So that's not significantly included in our guide, I would say. And then, remember one other thing as well is we're still \u2013 and again, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this, but we are still in a pandemic year and we still have an expectation here that for the first six months of the year that we are in a pandemic. I would not call this a normal year, but in the second half we hope to be coming out of the pandemic definitely with the progress that's being made around vaccination rates as well. But all good points that you made, but hopefully this gives you some additional background.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, so now I will talk about two things. I'll talk about the customer event; I talk about the roadmap and I'll talk about the GRAIL MRD test. So, we do have a customer event, it's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event that we will have at the tail end of April. It\u2019s shaping up to be a terrific event, and we have some fabulous speakers and we have tracks for different segments of our customer base. So, they will be track, for example, on population sequencing, where we will convene some of the largest population sequencing initiatives around the world to come together, share best practices and learn from each other. And we'll do the same thing for oncology testing, and so on.  I suspect whether you were going ask, Puneet was, so are we going to announce anything at the customer event. And I've been on the record of saying, I'd love to announce products in front of customers rather than in front of bankers. But obviously I can't say what we're going to do in terms of product roadmaps as a company, we don't preannounce products. What we did announce recently the P1 one flow cell. On the NextSeq, we announced, ICA the connected analytics platform at JP Morgan, which is seeing really nice traction in population sequencing efforts. And obviously we did the v1.5. So, you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we announced when. In terms of the GRAIL just MRD in general, and then the GRAIL MRD tests, we are very excited about the impact on patients' lives from having an MRD test. We think that that will improve life for cancer patients, enable them to catch a recurrence earlier and that's going to be an important market. And there's a big opportunity there. As you said, there are two customers already of ours that have MRD tests. We will support them. We want to make sure they are hugely successful because this is an important segment and a large segment of the genomics application as well. So, we'll continue to do everything we can to make sure they are successful. We're also excited about GRAIL MRD test. And GRAIL has a little bit of a different take on their approach on MRD. And the difference between what GRAIL is trying to do and what some of the other players are trying to do is that, some of the tests that exist in the market today are patient-specific tests. And so, the way it works is, you do a tumor profile on a particular patient's cancer, and you \u2013 based on that tissue sample, you take from that patient, and then you create the test for that cancer patient, and you run that as a blood test then going forward. So terrific test, very important, very groundbreaking. But because you are taking a tissue sample and you are building a patient specific test; it does take some time. GRAIL is using a different approach. They're basing their MRD test on their screening tests, which means it isn't patient specific but it's the single blood test that they use for screening that they are using for MRD as well. That should significantly compress the timeframe in terms of having that test available for a patient and doesn't require a tissue biopsy. And so, we think to have a differentiated view on the market. And we\u2019re excited about bringing that to the market as well, and giving patients the choice. Over the last few weeks GRAIL announced some important partnerships. So, at JP Morgan, we talked about the fact that GRAIL announced partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, as partners for its MRD test. Obviously, a terrific set of partners. And continues to show good momentum around the development of that test with GRAIL.\nOperator: Your next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon.\nFrancis deSouza: Hey Derik.\nSam Samad: Hey Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: Hey, so two questions. So, first one, I would just want to talk about is, can you talk a little bit about the culture expectations for the mid-range instruments for the NextSeq and MiSeq as you look into 2021? I appreciate the color on the NovaSeq, but some commentary there would be helpful, particularly I think on the NextSeq, as you're sort of placing more instruments on the 2000 and 1000 side. And then on the other side, the other question is a follow-on Doug's. Can you talk a little bit on GRAIL in terms of thinking about how your \u2013 do I need to do a sales and marketing plan here and how you're going to address customers? I mean, do you need to go out and build or buy more primary care of sales force, given where your current business is not exactly targeting that market. I'm just sort of curious in terms about your commercialization plans and how you think about the go-to-market strategy? Thanks.\nSam Samad: So maybe I will start with the pull-through question and thanks Derik, by the way. And Francis can talk about GRAIL. With regards to pull-through on the mid-throughput and low throughput, Derik, so starting with NextSeq, we will not yet give a pull-through expectation for NextSeq. There's a lot of moving parts there, as you know, with regards to NextSeq 2000, the introduction being fairly recently, at the end of Q1 of last year with the NextSeq 1000 coming into the mix as well, late in the year. And so those will have an impact on NextSeq 550 and we're still evaluating what the potential pull-through would look like in terms of NextSeq 2000. So it would be premature right now to give a guidance range around what the pull-through expectation is there. With regards to low throughput, MiSeq and MiniSeq as well. MiSeq was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So usually we give a guidance range of 40,000 to 45,000 per box on MiSeq. It was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So it was well below that. And then it started to approach that lower end of the range towards the end of 2020 in terms of the high 30s. So right now, we're expecting somewhere for MiSeq close to 35,000 to 40,000 in terms of MiSeq pull-through per box for 2021. With regards to MiniSeq, usually, the range is 20 to 25 and we are expecting to be on the low end of that range for MiniSeq.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Sam. So let me pick up then on the commercialization plan for GRAIL. So let me start by saying that post-acquisition, the intent is to run GRAIL as a separate division. So it's going to have its own sort of end-to-end infrastructure. The go-to-market plan for GRAIL and you've started to see glimpses of this, is not going to be, to build this big direct-to-physician sales force necessarily. The initial plan for GRAIL is to sell to \u2013 it's a B2B model, right, to sell to health systems, national health systems, like the deal they talked about with the NHS, for example, but also integrated health systems in the U.S. to sell to concierge health systems and to sell to self-insured employers. And so that's an enterprise sale, B2B sale so similar to what we do at Illumina, obviously, a little bit different, but we also have an enterprise sales force. And so that's the intent with GRAIL going forward. And while there might be some patient advocacy and some education, I think one of the advantages that GRAIL have, relative to some of the tests in the market today is that it's a blood test. And it doesn't require a lot of pushing to get people to be compliant with the test that they have to take home, for example. And so it's a little bit of a different model that they're using, again they are using that model today. So they have sort of an IDE from the FDA and they are returning results to patients in some really top tier health care systems like the Cleveland and so on. And so that's the model that they are refining, that's the model that's going to be rolled out to the NHS. And so that's the model they expect to continue going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Had a couple just on China, you guys saw the highest instrument revenue in a few years there in the fourth quarter. I think you talked about seeing some more adoption in the hospital side. Can you just provide a bit more color on what you're seeing in that region also would be great to get an update on the competitive landscape? Have you seen any changes in China in terms of competitive behavior? And then lastly, probably for Sam, just on the guidance, what are you assuming for China in terms of the outlook?\nSam Samad: Maybe I'll start with the last part because it's easy. So we are expecting revenue growth for China that exceeds our overall revenue growth as a company. So I would say, slightly above our overall revenue growth. And we're seeing very encouraging things in China as evidenced by the performance in Q4 and the instrument number that you talked about. But I'll let maybe Francis give some additional color.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me pick up on that. So we are obviously very bullish on China. Sam said, we expect China to go faster than the overall company in 2021. So what's driving that, a few things, one, we're now starting to see sort of the next wave of adoption in the clinical market in China. And so we're seeing more hospitals embrace sequencing in their own hospital labs. And so that's sort of a wave that started to grow last year and certainly sort of picking up as we entered this year. That was part of the reason why this last quarter in Q4 was the highest score we've had for instruments since 2017 when we launched NovaSeq. And that was driven partially by hospitals, starting to embrace sequencing and sort of bringing it into their labs. We are seeing COVID drive some purchasing of sequencing. We talked about the fact that again, we got called into Wuhan in December 2019. We've been involved since then as part of their pandemic fighting efforts. That's a part of this business. And again, it's part of a durable surveillance infrastructure that's being built out. And then, we continue to be long-term excited about the opportunity in China. And you saw us, for example, announced the partnership with one of the top venture capital firms in China, Sequoia Capital China, to launch a genomic incubator in China to catalyze the next-generation of exciting genomics applications that leverage Illumina sequencing technology.\nOperator: Your next question is from Sung Ji Nam with BTIG.\nSung Ji Nam: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. One is just going back to the surveillance opportunity for COVID and other applications in the future. I don't know, if it's too early, but would you be able to kind of talk about what that the market potential might be going forward? And if not, is this something \u2013 is this an infrastructure that come to scale that the flu surveillance infrastructure might be currently, or is it a much larger scale kind of effort? And then the second question is, you guys talked about the improvement on the flow cell, the order of magnitude improvement leading to roughly 90% of cost savings for the flow cell. What does that translate into in terms of the total all-in cost per genome? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: So maybe I'll start and talk about the surveillance opportunity. It's too early to size the surveillance opportunity. I think is sort of the short answer. But in terms of how to think about this, I think it's done right. It's significantly bigger than what we have today with the flu. And obviously, this pandemic was sort of a wake up moment from so many perspectives. I'll give you one example. We were talking to officials from the U.S. government at some point in sort of late Q1, early Q2. And there was a realization that we have the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. for weeks and people were dying maybe months, and we didn't even know that we had it. And that's a huge wake-up call because that's important, not just for a coronavirus pandemic, but it has implications around surveillance for bio-terrorism, for example. And so, the wake up call is to say, look, we need the surveillance infrastructure, and we need a global surveillance infrastructure. It's got to be genomics based, and it's got to watch for emerging anti-microbial resistance, new pathogens, bio-terrorism. The scope of that is significantly bigger than flu tracking that happens today. The other interesting dynamic that's playing out is, this is absolutely a public health infrastructure, essential for public health, absolutely. But it's also a defense infrastructure and the two are funded very differently, right. So public health, as you know, goes from panic to starvation, right. So there's a panic infrastructure gets built and then maybe doesn't always get the funding follow through. Defense is not like that. And so this is going to be a combination of both. It's going to be a public health infrastructure and is going to be a part of the national defense infrastructure. So you think about this long-term, it's definitely got a scope that's significantly bigger in terms of thinking than what we do with flu today.\nSam Samad: Yes. And Sung Ji, with regards to the 90% reduction, I mean, Francis introduced some really exciting innovation roadmap and technology roadmap items at JP Morgan. And the 90% reduction in terms of costs, it's really talking about not a product that we have today, but really the roadmap that we have and the technologies that we have today that will become a product that takes us to the $100 genome and below that even in terms of a cost per genome.\nOperator: Your final question is from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Appreciate the time here. One quick cleanup on COVID surveillance, Francis, on the P1 flow cell, I believe it's shipping in the second half of the year. Is there anything you can do to pull that forward in terms of the launch timeline, given the focus on surveillance, both in the U.S. and abroad and this need for a lower throughput NextSeq option? And then my second question is on GRAIL. In the past, you sort of alluded to the possibility of potentially, some sort of a risk sharing structure and sort of Illumina being on the hook for or other players being on the hook for a rise in overall diagnostic testing costs, following gallery deployment in order to encourage customers to participate in pilots. Have you sort of like chopped any wood in terms of implementing those sort of arrangements just yet? Or is it still too early?\nFrancis deSouza: Got it. So let me answer the P1 question and then pick up on the sort of, I guess, the partnerships. I'll start by saying, now you know, how I feel right, in the sense that we have this incredible portfolio of products that our engineering team is building. And every one of them, I wish we could get earlier, because when I think about the impact and 18% of our revenue, we spend in R&D and it's a breathtaking set of products that the team is building. They are going as fast as they can to get the product out with the quality they need, especially given, the important work that our customers do with our product. So while I'd love to, the reality is, we can't pull P1 forward, although I know people really, really want it. And that's true across our entire portfolio. And I think you're right, it will actually have \u2013 it will have a really an important role to play even in surveillance. I think your second question was around, the partnerships that we were looking to do with other customers in the oncology diagnostic space. And we're looking to get into screening and we're making progress with those customers. We've signed supply agreements, long-term supply agreements with some of those customers and continuing dialogue with the remaining customers. And so, our commitment is to continue to supply them with the technology they need and make sure that they have all equal access to the technologies that we commercialize going forward. In some cases, those are agreements that are over a decade long and that's great for our customers. That's great for us too.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time, your closing remarks, please.\nJuliet Cunningham: Yes. Thank you so much, everyone for the great questions. As a reminder, there's a replay of this call that will be available tomorrow on our website on the Investor Relations page. We look forward to updating you on our progress after the close of Q1. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Juliet. Good afternoon everyone. Illumina had a strong finish to 2020, with both revenue and orders setting new records. Fourth quarter revenue of $953 million, was up 20% sequentially from the third quarter. Sequencing Instruments grew 29% quarter-over-quarter. We also booked the second highest NovaSeq units during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the August launch of our V1.5 reagents. V1.5 resulted in higher new customer growth, as well as additional HiSeq conversions. NovaSeq continues to be the market-leading sequencer as it enters its fifth year since launch. Full year 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9% year-over-year with the largest impact from the pandemic in the second quarter. Our business accelerated in the second half of the year, growing 17% compared to the first half. In 2020, we shipped more than 2,000 sequencing systems, set another record for mid-throughput shipments and added more than 700 new customers, which exceeded our expectations. I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights by platform, starting with our high-throughput systems. NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year at over $1.2 million per instrument. We expect NovaSeq pull-through to continue at pre-pandemic levels of $1.1 to $1.2 million per year in 2021. The NovaSeq v1.5 reagent introduction is catalyzing a new wave of high-throughput customers as the $600 genome became a reality for labs of any size. In fact, over half of our NovaSeq system orders in 2020 were to new high throughput customers. This includes customers like Argentina's Ministry of Health, who purchased NovaSeq for infectious disease research. The V 1.5 introduction also accelerated the purchasing timeline for CellCarta, a contract research organization and a new-to-high throughput customer, who plans to use their NovaSeq to support oncology clinical trials. The V 1.5 reagents are also strengthening the economic case for legacy HiSeq customers to upgrade, like the University of Oregon, who is using NovaSeq for large, single cell and epigenetics studies. We ended the year with about 1,000 active HiSeq units and in 2021, we expect continued HiSeq to NovaSeq adoption among the 320 customers yet to transition. Moving to mid-throughput, 2020 marked the second consecutive year of record placements, and the mid-throughput segment continues to provide durable growth in our core business. Fourth quarter strength was primarily driven by the successful launches of NextSeq 1000 and 2000, which also drove an increase in mid-throughput consumable revenue for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect continued NextSeq expansion in 2021, particularly in the clinical segment. Notably, we received NMPA approval in China for NextSeq Dx, driving demand in local hospitals in applications like oncology and infectious disease testing. We expect this approval to drive NextSeq Dx placements and further increase our clinical presence in 2021. We added more than 500 new low-throughput customers in 2020, bringing our total to more than 6,100 customers worldwide. Our platforms hold the largest set of flow cell configurations and enable the most expansive set of supported methods with run times as fast as five hours. In the fourth quarter, we had record low-throughput consumable revenue driven by customers like Invitae, who has products in development using the MiSeq Dx. I'll now provide updates on our Clinical and Research and Applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $2 billion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on academic and research institutions. By the fourth quarter of 2020, clinical sequencing run-rates actually exceeded pre-pandemic levels and research run-rates also returned to normalized pre-pandemic volumes. It was great to see how our customers successfully rebounded under these challenging circumstances. More than 43% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2020 were to clinical customers, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health, and genetic disease. Clinical testing proved durable during the pandemic with clinical consumables growing about 8% year-over-year to approximately $890 million in 2020. And in the fourth quarter, clinical consumables growth accelerated to over 20% year-over-year. In clinical, I'll highlight first the tremendous progress made in market access and reimbursement. We believe recent landmark coverage decisions will drive greater adoption of next-generation sequencing to new levels over the next several years. In oncology, 205 million lives are now covered for tumor comprehensive genomic profiling in the U.S., and with an increasing number of targeted oncology therapies, we expect CGP to grow to be a $1 billion plus market by 2026. Additionally, Germany recently started covering tumor CGP and whole exome and whole genome for rare and undiagnosed genetic disease without restrictions. This means that 73 million lives will have better access to CGP and whole exome and whole genome testing. In reproductive health, with multiple large payors expanding coverage for all pregnancies, we expect NIPT coverage in the U.S. to exceed three million pregnancies by the end of 2021. And finally, whole genome sequencing coverage for genetic disease testing increased 10-fold in 2020 and we expect WGS to become the standard of care in genetic disease as awareness and reimbursement continues to grow. With these positive reimbursement trends as a backdrop, I'll now discuss our clinical focus areas in a little more detail. Oncology testing continues to represent approximately 20% of total sequencing consumables, and it grew year-over-year driven by companies like Guardant Health, who expanded its mobile phlebotomy services to help patients access its Guardant360 liquid biopsy test during the pandemic. This also includes Genomic Hubs in the NHS that adopted NovaSeq comprehensive genomic profiling as the standard of care in the UK, and oncology centers like Florida Cancer Specialists, a private community oncology and hematology practice with nearly 100 offices throughout Florida. Florida Cancer Specialists purchased multiple NextSeq Dx systems in 2020 to run Illumina's Trusight Oncology 500 assay in its new lab. Reproductive health represented about 12% of sequencing consumables, with revenue and samples for our end-to-end VeriSeq NIPT solution growing over 20% in 2020. Lastly, about 10% of our sequencing consumables revenue is related to genetic disease testing. Customers continue to choose Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers as their platform of choice in this area. For example, the recent collaboration between Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in partnership with the New York Genome Center, will use Illumina technology for clinical WGS in areas like cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Turning to our Research and Applied segment, revenue of approximately $1.2 billion represented just under 57% of our sequencing consumable shipments and was lower by about 6% year-over-year as customers were impacted by the pandemic. Research accelerated in the second half, growing 20% compared to the first half as researchers returned to their labs. This segment includes research in oncology and genetic disease, as well as population genomic and research initiatives. Our sequencers enable programs like KDNA, a large scale Korean project aiming to sequence 1 million genomes by 2030. A service provider consortium, standardized on Illumina technology, won the competitive tender based on NovaSeq's superior technical evaluation. The program plans to complete its 7,500-genome Phase 1 by the end of the year. The NHS commenced a phased rollout for whole genome sequencing in the fourth quarter for selected rare disease and cancer patients as part of their routine care. Once this live clinical testing phase is complete, we expect the whole genome sequencing service to further ramp in the spring. We expect the All of Us program to continue to scale this year, and the NIH anticipates releasing de-identified data from 100,000 sequenced and array genotyped samples to its research portal by the end of 2021. Finally, as a leading innovator, Illumina remains steadfast in the defense of our intellectual property globally. We received injunctions against BGI for patent infringement in the U.S., Germany, UK, Spain, Sweden and Finland. We remain confident that our IP portfolio affords strong protection for Illumina's innovations now and well into the future. And now, I'll turn it over to Sam. We're off to a strong start in 2021. We're seeing strength in our core business and are playing an essential role in the emerging surveillance effort necessary to fight the pandemic. In the past couple of months, as new, more dangerous SARS-Cov-2 variants have emerged, there has been a growing recognition of the need for COVID surveillance around the globe, with countries like U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany leading the way in deploying national surveillance infrastructures. In the U.S., the proposed budget package, contains $1.75 billion for the CDC to conduct, expand, and improve activities to sequence genomes, identify mutations, and survey the transmission of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Sequencing-based surveillance is one of the key elements in the fight against this pandemic, and it's also becoming clear that sequencing and surveillance are becoming mainstream in the defense against infectious disease. This global surveillance infrastructure being built right now will be instrumental in identifying future outbreaks \u2013 including coronaviruses, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. Illumina is proud to be at the forefront of this important work. We'd also like to congratulate Nobel Laureate and Illumina Board member, Dr. Frances Arnold, who was named as CoChair of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. We believe the recent appointments of highly experienced scientists signal the Administration's focus on science, including genomics, to improve life in the U.S. for everyone. Finally, we continue to expect to close the GRAIL acquisition in the second half of this year, enabling us to help accelerate the adoption of early cancer detection screening, and open up the largest application for genomics by far. We are looking forward to GRAIL launching Galleri in Q2. We see a vast number of opportunities ahead of us and there has never been a more exciting time to be in genomics at Illumina. Now, I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A. Super. Thanks, Sam. So Dan I'll take your question about NovaSeq this year and touch specifically also on the remaining HiSeq customers and how we're thinking about it this year. So I'll start by saying that, look, we're entering this year with a lot of momentum on NovaSeq. The version 1.5 NovaSeq reagents that we released in August really did a nice job in terms of unlocking the elasticity of demand in that high throughput segment of the market. And so as we talked about coming into this year, we're coming off Q4 where in our first quarter of selling the version 1.5 reagents. NovaSeq consumables had a record quarter, growing in the mid-teens year-over-year. So really strong from consumables perspective. And we talked about the fact that in Q4 we also had our second highest order in terms of bookings orders for NovaSeq and the first highest was when we first launched NovaSeq back in 2017. So both from a \u2013 an instruments perspective and a consumables perspective, we're coming off a really strong Q4, and we're walking into this year with a really strong pipeline and a strong backlog following the orders that came in Q4. So as we think about this year Dan, there are two sources of demand we see for NovaSeq. One, and we talked about this in Q4 also that we're seeing \u2013 because of 1.5, really an unlocking demand from new to high throughput customers. And if you think about in Q4, over half the bookings went to new to high throughput customers. So again that new pricing is opening up the market for new customers to come in. And the other source of demand for NovaSeq coming into this year is the remaining HiSeq customers. And as we pointed out, there are \u2013 of our original HiSeq base, we still have 320 customers that have yet to begin the upgrade cycle. And now with the lower pricing on 1.5, these typically smaller core labs now have a NovaSeq accessible to them. And if you look at the pricing now, all it takes for a HiSeq 2,500 customer is for them to run about four high output gets a month, and they can justify the list price of a NovaSeq in a year. In addition, with the 1.5 release, we extended the shelf life of the consumables from three months to six months, so they don't have to sequence as frequency to justify the upgrade. And then finally, the new 35 cycles as four kits also enables counting methods now on the NovaSeq, which was important to those labs. So you add all those in, and we're walking into this year with strong momentum on the NovaSeq side, and that's what we expect to drive orders this year. In fact, we're expecting another strong year of NovaSeq orders coming into 2021. Yes. Let me build on \u2013 yes let me build on Sam's remark. So you're right, Tycho, this is a significant raise for us in terms of what we were expecting for Q1, given what we shared at JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan what we shared was very typical for our business and other players in our business, which is sequentially from Q4 to Q1 because of the capital cycle, you expect a decrease in revenue. And that's what we called. And we said, look, you should expect us to be flat to Q1 of last year. But we're seeing a lot more strength even in the first few weeks of the quarter. And that strength is coming from our core business, as Sam said, and we're monitoring both \u2013 not just orders, but we're monitoring activity levels. And exiting Q4 and into Q1 we are seeing strong activity levels both from the clinical side of the business, but also on the research side of the business. And so as we stand here, it's become clear to us that instead of being flat to a year ago, we're going to be up high single digits. And so we're coming pretty close to where we were in Q4. That's unusual in this business, but it really speaks to the strength that we're seeing in terms of orders coming in. Obviously, there's a lot of the year left. And so we're leaving the year guidance intact, but certainly strength in Q1. In terms of surveillance, surveillance is something we've been talking about now for about a year. And the idea is that, in addition to rolling out testing infrastructure to fight this pandemic, you will need surveillance infrastructure to understand how the virus is spreading geographically and how it's mutating. And that information about mutations are essential to understand that the tools we're using to fight the pandemic, the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies will continue to be effective. And really once the outbreak we started to see around Christmas of the B117 variants in the U.K. and then the South African variants that started to really get people realized that we do need the surveillance infrastructure. So then contribute much in terms of revenue in Q4 and we only built in a modest amount in Q1, but you can see the activity, right? You can see the activity in CoG-UK, you can see the activity in countries around the world, in France, in Germany, Italy, and Spain and Greece, sort of around the world. And we expect that to continue over the course of this year, as countries build out these surveillance infrastructures, and that's going to be a durable surveillance infrastructure. We're going to need it in the future to warn us of the next pandemic, to warn us of bioterrorist attacks, anti-microbial resistance. And what's interesting is that Illumina's technology is uniquely well-suited for this need. And the reason for that is because, we have unmatched accuracy, we can deliver with the highest scale, we can deliver the price point per sample that's necessary and we also have the first cleared product for customers to use. And so those things came together and you'll see that playing out in the numbers, right. So right at the very beginning, we were the sequencer used in Wuhan and then in Shanghai to publish the first viral genome. It was the Illumina sequencing data that was used by the vaccine developers to develop the vaccines, the MRA vaccines are being used today. And that was because of the accuracy of the Illumina sequencing. And now, as you look at the large-scale initiatives, CoG-UK, and some of the other ones, it's Illumina's sequencers that's being used because of the scale that we can achieve, and the throughput, and the turnaround time. And so, you look at the numbers of the genomes in Jessa, for example, and you will see that the vast majority of the data, and Jessa, the vast majority of the genomes that have been sequenced have been done on Illumina sequencers. And so very exciting, very important, starting now. Yes, now if I could add on the GRAIL side. So, no new update. So that means GRAIL is on track, with its PATHFINDER results, as they said at JP Morgan in their announcement for Q1 and they are on track for a gallery launch in Q2. We know they are making progress with both health systems and self-insured employers. They haven't announced anything yet, but I know, for example, we are marching down the path at Illumina to make the GRAIL test available to our employees in the second half of this year. And as part of that process, our team has been engaged with other employers that are also in process with them. The big announcement, obviously from the health system side was the announcement around the NHS and that's tracking for the pilot to be launched this year. And as a reminder, that's 165,000 tests that they've committed to doing with the intent, then assuming that goes well, to do a million tests in 2024, and then do a population wide rollout. Yes, so now I will talk about two things. I'll talk about the customer event; I talk about the roadmap and I'll talk about the GRAIL MRD test. So, we do have a customer event, it's going to be sort of our first global this year virtual customer event that we will have at the tail end of April. It's shaping up to be a terrific event, and we have some fabulous speakers and we have tracks for different segments of our customer base. So, they will be track, for example, on population sequencing, where we will convene some of the largest population sequencing initiatives around the world to come together, share best practices and learn from each other. And we'll do the same thing for oncology testing, and so on.  I suspect whether you were going ask, Puneet was, so are we going to announce anything at the customer event. And I've been on the record of saying, I'd love to announce products in front of customers rather than in front of bankers. But obviously I can't say what we're going to do in terms of product roadmaps as a company, we don't preannounce products. What we did announce recently the P1 one flow cell. On the NextSeq, we announced, ICA the connected analytics platform at JP Morgan, which is seeing really nice traction in population sequencing efforts. And obviously we did the v1.5. So, you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we announced when. In terms of the GRAIL just MRD in general, and then the GRAIL MRD tests, we are very excited about the impact on patients' lives from having an MRD test. We think that that will improve life for cancer patients, enable them to catch a recurrence earlier and that's going to be an important market. And there's a big opportunity there. As you said, there are two customers already of ours that have MRD tests. We will support them. We want to make sure they are hugely successful because this is an important segment and a large segment of the genomics application as well. So, we'll continue to do everything we can to make sure they are successful. We're also excited about GRAIL MRD test. And GRAIL has a little bit of a different take on their approach on MRD. And the difference between what GRAIL is trying to do and what some of the other players are trying to do is that, some of the tests that exist in the market today are patient-specific tests. And so, the way it works is, you do a tumor profile on a particular patient's cancer, and you \u2013 based on that tissue sample, you take from that patient, and then you create the test for that cancer patient, and you run that as a blood test then going forward. So terrific test, very important, very groundbreaking. But because you are taking a tissue sample and you are building a patient specific test; it does take some time. GRAIL is using a different approach. They're basing their MRD test on their screening tests, which means it isn't patient specific but it's the single blood test that they use for screening that they are using for MRD as well. That should significantly compress the timeframe in terms of having that test available for a patient and doesn't require a tissue biopsy. And so, we think to have a differentiated view on the market. And we're excited about bringing that to the market as well, and giving patients the choice. Over the last few weeks GRAIL announced some important partnerships. So, at JP Morgan, we talked about the fact that GRAIL announced partnerships with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, as partners for its MRD test. Obviously, a terrific set of partners. And continues to show good momentum around the development of that test with GRAIL. Hey Derik. Thanks, Sam. So let me pick up then on the commercialization plan for GRAIL. So let me start by saying that post-acquisition, the intent is to run GRAIL as a separate division. So it's going to have its own sort of end-to-end infrastructure. The go-to-market plan for GRAIL and you've started to see glimpses of this, is not going to be, to build this big direct-to-physician sales force necessarily. The initial plan for GRAIL is to sell to \u2013 it's a B2B model, right, to sell to health systems, national health systems, like the deal they talked about with the NHS, for example, but also integrated health systems in the U.S. to sell to concierge health systems and to sell to self-insured employers. And so that's an enterprise sale, B2B sale so similar to what we do at Illumina, obviously, a little bit different, but we also have an enterprise sales force. And so that's the intent with GRAIL going forward. And while there might be some patient advocacy and some education, I think one of the advantages that GRAIL have, relative to some of the tests in the market today is that it's a blood test. And it doesn't require a lot of pushing to get people to be compliant with the test that they have to take home, for example. And so it's a little bit of a different model that they're using, again they are using that model today. So they have sort of an IDE from the FDA and they are returning results to patients in some really top tier health care systems like the Cleveland and so on. And so that's the model that they are refining, that's the model that's going to be rolled out to the NHS. And so that's the model they expect to continue going forward. Yes. So let me pick up on that. So we are obviously very bullish on China. Sam said, we expect China to go faster than the overall company in 2021. So what's driving that, a few things, one, we're now starting to see sort of the next wave of adoption in the clinical market in China. And so we're seeing more hospitals embrace sequencing in their own hospital labs. And so that's sort of a wave that started to grow last year and certainly sort of picking up as we entered this year. That was part of the reason why this last quarter in Q4 was the highest score we've had for instruments since 2017 when we launched NovaSeq. And that was driven partially by hospitals, starting to embrace sequencing and sort of bringing it into their labs. We are seeing COVID drive some purchasing of sequencing. We talked about the fact that again, we got called into Wuhan in December 2019. We've been involved since then as part of their pandemic fighting efforts. That's a part of this business. And again, it's part of a durable surveillance infrastructure that's being built out. And then, we continue to be long-term excited about the opportunity in China. And you saw us, for example, announced the partnership with one of the top venture capital firms in China, Sequoia Capital China, to launch a genomic incubator in China to catalyze the next-generation of exciting genomics applications that leverage Illumina sequencing technology. So maybe I'll start and talk about the surveillance opportunity. It's too early to size the surveillance opportunity. I think is sort of the short answer. But in terms of how to think about this, I think it's done right. It's significantly bigger than what we have today with the flu. And obviously, this pandemic was sort of a wake up moment from so many perspectives. I'll give you one example. We were talking to officials from the U.S. government at some point in sort of late Q1, early Q2. And there was a realization that we have the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. for weeks and people were dying maybe months, and we didn't even know that we had it. And that's a huge wake-up call because that's important, not just for a coronavirus pandemic, but it has implications around surveillance for bio-terrorism, for example. And so, the wake up call is to say, look, we need the surveillance infrastructure, and we need a global surveillance infrastructure. It's got to be genomics based, and it's got to watch for emerging anti-microbial resistance, new pathogens, bio-terrorism. The scope of that is significantly bigger than flu tracking that happens today. The other interesting dynamic that's playing out is, this is absolutely a public health infrastructure, essential for public health, absolutely. But it's also a defense infrastructure and the two are funded very differently, right. So public health, as you know, goes from panic to starvation, right. So there's a panic infrastructure gets built and then maybe doesn't always get the funding follow through. Defense is not like that. And so this is going to be a combination of both. It's going to be a public health infrastructure and is going to be a part of the national defense infrastructure. So you think about this long-term, it's definitely got a scope that's significantly bigger in terms of thinking than what we do with flu today. Got it. So let me answer the P1 question and then pick up on the sort of, I guess, the partnerships. I'll start by saying, now you know, how I feel right, in the sense that we have this incredible portfolio of products that our engineering team is building. And every one of them, I wish we could get earlier, because when I think about the impact and 18% of our revenue, we spend in R&D and it's a breathtaking set of products that the team is building. They are going as fast as they can to get the product out with the quality they need, especially given, the important work that our customers do with our product. So while I'd love to, the reality is, we can't pull P1 forward, although I know people really, really want it. And that's true across our entire portfolio. And I think you're right, it will actually have \u2013 it will have a really an important role to play even in surveillance. I think your second question was around, the partnerships that we were looking to do with other customers in the oncology diagnostic space. And we're looking to get into screening and we're making progress with those customers. We've signed supply agreements, long-term supply agreements with some of those customers and continuing dialogue with the remaining customers. And so, our commitment is to continue to supply them with the technology they need and make sure that they have all equal access to the technologies that we commercialize going forward. In some cases, those are agreements that are over a decade long and that's great for our customers. That's great for us too."

            "content": "Thank you, Francis. As Francis discussed, we had record fourth quarter revenue that grew slightly year-over-year to $953 million, driven by 1% growth in sequencing offset by an 8% decline in microarrays. Total sequencing revenue reached a record of $846 million, which represented 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and grew 19% sequentially. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 5% compared to the prior year period and 20% sequentially. Sequencing instruments revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and grew 29% sequentially and sequencing service and other was down 15% compared to the prior year period due to IVD partnership revenue recognized last year. Moving to regional results, the Americas revenue grew 14% sequentially. Revenue in the region was 2% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by one-time technology access fees for an IVD partnership and lower DTC revenue. These items were partially offset by sequencing consumables. The Americas had record sequencing product revenue in the fourth quarter, driven by clinical customers. EMEA delivered record revenue of $285 million, representing 34% sequential growth and 2% growth year-over-year driven by strong instrument revenue from NovaSeq. We also saw certain customers in emerging countries taking their first NovaSeq shipments. Greater China grew 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year to $96 million and had its highest sequencing instrument revenue quarter since 2017, driven in part by growing demand in hospitals. Subsequent to Q4, we also announced the Sequoia Capital China Genomics Incubator, which builds on our other incubator efforts in Silicon Valley and the U.K. together. We will partner with leading entrepreneurs in China to build genomics startup companies to create breakthrough genomics applications and clinical sequencing solutions. Finally, APJ revenue of $77 million was up 24% sequentially and up 5% from the prior year period. For the full year, the region was roughly flat compared to 2019 with full year growth in sequencing consumables. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. As expected, non-GAAP gross margin of 66.9% decreased approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was down 330 basis points primarily due to a one-time inventory write down in Q4, one-time IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, and higher freight costs related to COVID-19. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $439 million were up $74 million sequentially, as expected, reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter, variable compensation expenses and other investments. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, down from 21.4% in the third quarter. Non-GAAP other income of $20 million was $13 million higher sequentially due to gains on short term investments sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.4% was up from last quarter due to a discrete charge related to a tax structure initiative in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase of our tax rate in Q4 was also impacted by discrete tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 related to prior year return adjustments. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $257 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $179 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items: Cash flow from operations was $406 million. DSO of 50 days compared to 53 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $62 million and free cash flow was $344 million. We repurchased $280 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance: We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 17% to 20% or $3.79 billion to $3.89 billion representing an increase of approximately $599 million at the midpoint. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 20%; this includes sequencing consumable growth of around 20%; we expect sequencing system revenue to grow 33% year-over-year driven by placements of NovaSeq due to continued HiSeq conversions, and the adoption of V 1.5 reagents, as well as placements of NextSeq due to NextSeq 2000 and Dx demand; and Arrays to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to modestly improve from 2020 reflecting increased leverage from higher volumes and cost saving initiatives partially offset by product mix, and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 24%. As volumes increase and freight charges normalize, we expect both gross and operating margins to improve in the second half of 2021 and be above the full year average. We expect other income to be about $40 million lower than 2020 due to the gains in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest rates, and shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $5.01, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.35. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 147 million. Moving to the first quarter of 2021: We are raising our previous expectations, and we now expect high-single digit revenue growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect sequential improvement in non-GAAP gross margin; sequential decline in non-GAAP operating expenses similar to historical seasonality; non-GAAP other income to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the one-time gain on short term investments previously discussed; and as a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. Thanks, Dan. So this is Sam. Hope you are doing well. So let me talk a little bit about the EPS guide of [indiscernible] for this year. Basically, we're expecting roughly 24% operating margin. So there is an element of OpEx growth in there. And part of that is a one time also impact related to stock-based compensation. We talked about at JPMorgan when we provided the guide, which is related to two plans for the 19 and 20 plans that were significantly impacted by the pandemic. And that we are modifying the targets on those plans. So that has a one-time catch up expense in 2021 of approximately $50 million to $55 million. And that's really a significant portion of the OpEx growth. Beyond that, we're continuing to invest behind our platforms, behind our technologies, behind our assays. So which we are committed to R&D is a big commitment for us. As we look forward Dan, our goal is to continue to improve in terms of the leverage on our operating margin to get back to traditional operating margin levels that we had back in 2019, which were close to 30%, that will take some time to get back to, but that's a commitment that we have is to continue to drive operating leverage by making sure that we're very actively focused on G&A investments and reducing or making sure that those continue to grow beyond the rate of growth in revenues. But then we continue to invest in R&D and to some extent, commercial as well. But we are committed over the long-term to get back into operating leverage. And in fact, in the second half as well of the year, as we get past the pandemic, the second half, we expect to see an improvement in terms of both gross margin and operating margin versus the first half and definitely higher than the full year as well for gross margin and operating margin. Yes, so may be I will cover a couple of the points that you mentioned upfront Tycho, and I'll let Francis talk about the surveillance aspect. So I think there's a lot there. So hopefully, I'll capture everything here. But in terms of Q4 stocking, we had a very strong quarter in Q4. We did not see any unusual stocking beyond what you see traditionally at the year end. I mean, there's usually a reset of budgets at the end of Q4, academic budgets at the end of the year. So beyond what we usually see every year, we have not seen any unusual stocking in Q4. And we validate this by looking at basically activity on our sequencers. We look at the activity, the data that we have, looking at all the active sequencers that we have that are connected. And in fact, we saw a strong increase in terms of activity levels in Q4 in terms of clinical, getting back and showing growth pre-pandemic levels, and in terms of research now going basically at pre-pandemic levels. So pleased to see that and \u2013 which validates that there wasn't any unusual stocking at the end of Q4. In terms of gross margin, I think we talked about the drivers, Tycho. I mean we're still impacted by the pandemic. Freight is still a factor for us in Q4. We did have the onetime write-down on certain inventory, which was approximately a percentage point impact negatively on gross margin. And mix was an impact as well in Q4 because we had strong instruments in the quarter as well. So those are the things that impacted margins in Q4. We expect margins to improve in Q1, to progressively improve across 2021. And in the second half in fact to be, as I said earlier, above the full year average. And starting to get back to our \u2013 what we call our normal levels of 70% plus \u2013 not quite at 70%, but close to that in the second half. So we definitely see that as we start to get out of the constraints driven by the pandemic, and which resulted in higher freight and other higher expenses. With regards to Q1 outlook, we are pleased to be raising our Q1 outlook based on what we're seeing. We're seeing strength in the business. We're seeing strength in activity levels. Again, too early to comment specifically, it's been four weeks since the start of the year. But everything that we're seeing in terms of orders is really encouraging. So we are pleased with where the business has started. Yes, thank you, Doug. This is Sam. Maybe I'll start with your pull-through question and then I'll let Francis talk to GRAIL. Yes, I think you hit the nail on the head with the comments that you made around pull through. I mean, we had a very, very, I would say, strong pull-through in Q4 in terms of $1.2 million per instrument, we were back to above pre-pandemic levels, actually at the high end of the guidance range in terms of pre-pandemic levels. We do expect with the v1.5 that you will have \u2013 that it will catalyze significant HiSeq conversion with those 320 remaining HiSeq customers. So those will start to also transition to NovaSeq. That has, I would say, a very modest impact on pull-through, on the downside, but also you have the large centers that will drive, pull-through higher on the upside.  But as you said, we're still in a pandemic year. The first six months of the year are expected to still be basically a pandemic reality, so to speak. And at this point, I think, it's prudent that the guidance that we have and the expectation that we have is the $1.1 million to $1.2 million range. We're very encouraged by what we saw in Q4. Yes, thanks Puneet. Hope you're doing well. So, this is Sam. I'll start with the sequencing consumable question, and then I'll let Francis comment on the roadmap question in the MRD one as well. So, we are expecting 20% sequencing consumable growth this year for a number of reasons there are some very good tailwinds in the business and strengthen in the core business that drive us to that. As you mentioned, additional market access and coverage for both on the NIPT side, on the genetic disease side, we're seeing definitely growth in the comprehensive genomic profiling on the oncology side, the v1.5 is a great introduction. The COVID variance part Puneet, we have not really assumed a significant impact of that in our guides, that's something that we're really encouraged by in terms of the surveillance aspect. We are seeing definitely strength from that, but again, a bit early to really size that for the full year. So that's not significantly included in our guide, I would say. And then, remember one other thing as well is we're still \u2013 and again, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this, but we are still in a pandemic year and we still have an expectation here that for the first six months of the year that we are in a pandemic. I would not call this a normal year, but in the second half we hope to be coming out of the pandemic definitely with the progress that's being made around vaccination rates as well. But all good points that you made, but hopefully this gives you some additional background. Hey Derik. So maybe I will start with the pull-through question and thanks Derik, by the way. And Francis can talk about GRAIL. With regards to pull-through on the mid-throughput and low throughput, Derik, so starting with NextSeq, we will not yet give a pull-through expectation for NextSeq. There's a lot of moving parts there, as you know, with regards to NextSeq 2000, the introduction being fairly recently, at the end of Q1 of last year with the NextSeq 1000 coming into the mix as well, late in the year. And so those will have an impact on NextSeq 550 and we're still evaluating what the potential pull-through would look like in terms of NextSeq 2000. So it would be premature right now to give a guidance range around what the pull-through expectation is there. With regards to low throughput, MiSeq and MiniSeq as well. MiSeq was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So usually we give a guidance range of 40,000 to 45,000 per box on MiSeq. It was impacted by the pandemic in 2020. So it was well below that. And then it started to approach that lower end of the range towards the end of 2020 in terms of the high 30s. So right now, we're expecting somewhere for MiSeq close to 35,000 to 40,000 in terms of MiSeq pull-through per box for 2021. With regards to MiniSeq, usually, the range is 20 to 25 and we are expecting to be on the low end of that range for MiniSeq. Maybe I'll start with the last part because it's easy. So we are expecting revenue growth for China that exceeds our overall revenue growth as a company. So I would say, slightly above our overall revenue growth. And we're seeing very encouraging things in China as evidenced by the performance in Q4 and the instrument number that you talked about. But I'll let maybe Francis give some additional color. Yes. And Sung Ji, with regards to the 90% reduction, I mean, Francis introduced some really exciting innovation roadmap and technology roadmap items at JP Morgan. And the 90% reduction in terms of costs, it's really talking about not a product that we have today, but really the roadmap that we have and the technologies that we have today that will become a product that takes us to the $100 genome and below that even in terms of a cost per genome."

We saw a strong rebound in our business in the third quarter with a faster recovery than we expected in both our clinical and research customers. Total revenue for the third quarter was $794 million, up 26% sequentially and down 12% compared to the prior year period. I'll share that the quarter highlight and Sam will provide more detailed financials. Sequencing revenue grew 25% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequencing consumables grew 29% sequentially with strength across our high, mid and low throughput product portfolio. NextSeq momentum continued to build. With mid throughput consumables growing both sequentially and 3% year-over-year, and we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter. Sequencing instruments also outperformed expectations with revenue up 24% sequentially. This growth was primarily driven by increased shipments of NovaSeq and NextSeq platforms. NovaSeq purchases have rebounded nicely from Q1 and some customers delaying purchases as shelter-in-place policies took effect. We have pleased with the sequential growth in NovaSeq shipments in each quarter since Q1. We're entering the fourth quarter with a strong NovaSeq pipeline and expect this sequential growth to continue in Q4. In addition, we had another successful quarter for our mid throughput portfolio with both NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 550 exceeding our expectations. Strong demand for these flexible sequencers led to record mid throughput shipments in the third quarter. We're especially pleased with the success of the NextSeq 2000 launch reflecting positive customer feedback and demand. Approximately one-third of the NextSeq 2000 placements are coming from new-to-Illumina customers. Consistent with our expectations, we've seen little cannibalization of NovaSeq conversions among the remaining HiSeq customers. Sequencing service and other revenue grew 9% sequentially and was 28% lower compared to the prior year, due to one-time IVD licensing and development revenue of over $30 million in the third quarter of last year. Total Microarray revenue of $86 million without 28% sequentially as direct-to-consumer customers and other applications began recovering from pandemic related headwinds. Turning to our customer segments. We saw solid improvement in both clinical and research activity. As a reminder, we track sequencing run rate as an indicator of general activity. Run volumes are based on sampling and do not directly correlate with revenue. The intent of providing this metric is to help investors understand customer sequencing activity. Clinical sequencing run volumes increased from an average of 84% in the second quarter to 96% during the third quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. In oncology, we're encouraged by signs of point to continued adoption of NGS in cancer treatment. The European Society for Medical Oncology or ESMO, became the first scientific society to issue recommendations for the use of NGS in oncology. Depending on the cancer type that society recommends NGS for large multi-gene panels for the determination of tumor mutation burden and to screen patients for clinical trials. Today, TSO 500 which is for research use only, provide comprehensive genomic profiling and has been adopted by approximately 250 customers. We're excited to release a CE-IVD-marked TSO comprehensive assay in 2021 labs can follow ESMO guidelines and continue to improve cancer patient outcomes. Growing payer option will continue to broaden the availability of these tests. Last month Aetna covering 19 million lives, announced coverage for large panel comprehensive genomic profiling for both solid and liquid including testing for TMB. We're also encouraged by the increasing availability and adoption for NGS-based liquid biopsy test. The recent FDA approval for Guardant360 and FoundationOne Liquid CDx demonstrate the clinical utility of these technologies that detect cell free DNA from the tumor in the blood and can provide comprehensive genomic profiling and tumor tissue if not available. Liquid biopsy panels like these broaden access to more patients who can benefit from NGS in their cancer treatment. Reproductive health showed strength in the quarter growing sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, during the third quarter reproductive health averaged over 100% of its pre-pandemic run rate. We expect sustained growth as reimbursement prospects have never looked more promising. Recently, ACOG updated its guidance to recommend the NIPT be made available to all pregnant women, regardless of maternal age or baseline risk. This is a major milestone, and we expect payers to continue to follow ACOG'S guidance, adding to the already $130 million plus lives covered for average risk in the U.S. Centene for example, recently aligned its guidelines, adding average risk coverage to an additional 23 million lives in the U.S. Centene is also the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the U.S. Meaning this coverage decision will bring NIPT as an option to more medically underserved areas and populations. In genetic disease testing, physicians, insurance companies and governments around the globe are increasingly adopting sequencing to diagnose children suspected of having genetic conditions. We're seeing solid progress on the reimbursement front. Payer adoption in the U.S. continues to grow. With more than double the lives covered for whole genome sequencing than at the start of the year. And Australia recently announced that it will reimburse whole exome or genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause of intellectual disabilities. These positive developments give us confidence and sustained long term growth in this under penetrated market. Turning to research sequencing runs show continued improvement and increase from an average of 65% in the second quarter to 82% in the third quarter, compared to its pre-pandemic run volumes. We're encouraged to see researchers returning to their labs and reopening, and this level of improvement exceeded our expectations. Within research, we're seeing the role of NGS take shape in infectious disease. We believe the most likely near term use case for sequencing is in research and surveillance for projects like Australia's first national COVID-19 tracking system, which aims to sequence the virus genomes of all positive COVID-19 tests in Australia. And track COVID-19 using genomics across the country. NIH is also increasing its funding for understanding COVID-19 and the transmission pathway using genomic testing. We continue to believe COVID-19 testing will be primarily served by PCR and antigen tests, with NGS providing supplemental testing capacity. As such, we're not factoring in the material contribution to revenue in the fourth quarter from COVID-19 testing. On the population genomics front, we're seeing promising signs of progress. All of us received its IDE approval from the FDA in the second quarter. And as expected, samples started to flow from the Biobank to partner genome centers. We expect the project to ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2021. During the third quarter, sequencing for the UK Biobank continued, and we expect levels to gradually return to normal and sequencing to continue into 2021. And we expect whole genome sequencing services for the NHS genomic medicine service to commence later this quarter. Given the NHS is current focus on COVID, we expect this program to gradually ramp over the next few quarters. Perhaps one of the most resilient popGen programs in the face of the pandemic has been the Million Veteran Program or MVP. The project aims to provide insight on how genetics, lifestyle and military exposures affect health and wellness. And has recently expanded its targeted enrollment from 1 million to 2 million veterans. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through a sequencing partner personalities expects to cross the hundred thousand whole genome milestone before the end of the year. We believe these and other initiatives will expand our markets and create exciting new opportunities for Illumina. We are committed to continuing to lead to innovation with new product launches to support the markets and customers we serve, including NovaSeq 6000 version 1.5 agents, which were launched during the third quarter. This release offers increased shelf life, improved quality scores, longer indices, and most importantly, it makes the $600 genome more broadly available to help smaller labs be successful and provides additional incentives for labs to upgrade from Hiseq to NovaSeq. NovaSeq 6000 version 1.5 reagents have been extremely well received by our customers. For example, the princess Maximus Center, the largest national pediatric oncology center in Europe was outsourcing its genome sequencing to a collaborator. But with the new reagents, they were able to purchase a NovaSeq and can now start to perform testing in house, meaning potentially care altering genomic information will reach children with cancer faster, and perform closer to the patient. The longer read lines, combined with high throughput scale, enable the Canadian biotech company to adopt the Novaseq 6000 for the development of antibody products for potential COVID-19 therapy. We're preparing to launch NextSeq 1000 this quarter. NextSeq 1000 enables lower throughput customers to adopt our newest platform as an entry point with the ability to field upgrade during the NextSeq 2000. We're also launching the P3 flow cells this quarter. Early Access P3 customers, including academic core labs are already using the flow cell for routine sequencing methods in mid sized research projects to enable faster turnaround times. Other customers are using P3 to develop workflows in single cell epigenetics and spatial transcriptomics. These are examples of how we continue to execute on our current and future plans, throughout these challenging times to advance our mission and create long term shareholder value. Now, I'll hand the call over to Sam to discuss the third quarter financials.\nSam Samad: Thanks, Francis. As discussed, third quarter 2020 revenue was $794 million, the 12% decline year-over-year, but a 26% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. While the global pandemic continued to impact our business, we saw encouraging signs of recovery within both clinical and research customers. Sequencing consumables revenue of $500 million was up 29% sequentially, and down 5% compared to the prior year period. Quarter-over-quarter growth of $113 million reflected significant improvement across high, mid and low throughput platforms. With NovaSeq flow through returning to over 1 million per system per year. Our mid-throughput sequencing consumables grew in the quarter versus the same period last year. Total sequencing system revenue of and $109 million was ahead of our expectations with both NovaSeq and our mid throughput platforms exceeding our expectations at the start of the quarter. The third quarter was also a record quarter for mid-throughput shipments driven by customer demand for NextSeq 2000 and the NextSeq 550 Dx platform. In fact, NextSeq shipments represented over 40% of NextSeq 550 shipments year to date. Since 2013, Illumina has shipped over 1000 Dx instruments reflecting the growing clinical nature of our customer base. Sequencing service and other revenue of $99 million was lower compared to the third quarter of 2019. Total sequencing revenue was $708 million and represented 89% of total revenue. Finally, total microarray revenue of $86 million was down 16% from the third quarter of 2019, reflecting lower consumables and services revenue, primarily driven by COVID-19 related headwinds. Turning to the region's, Americas revenue of $436 million was ahead of expectations and grew over $130 or 30%.compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequential growth was driven by both research and clinical customers as labs continued to reopen and clinical activity increased. In fact, clinical sequencing consumables grew modestly compared to the prior year period, as demand started to recover after delays and testing in the second quarter. EMEA revenue of $230 million was up $45 million, compared to the second quarter of 2020, with strength and sequencing consumables, which grew compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by a strong rebound in both clinical and research customers. China revenue grew sequentially to $83 million driven by strength in instrument placements. APJ revenue was roughly flat year-over-year at $62 million and increased $11 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. With NIPT helping to lead the recovery with sequential and year-over-year growth. Moving through the P&L, I will highlight non-GAAP results that includes stock based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 67.4% was lower as expected on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by IVD partnership revenue in the third quarter of 2019 not repeating this year, and lower volume and higher freight costs associated with the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $365 million were higher compared to the second quarter of 2020, and the same quarter last year. Sequential growth was driven as expected by an increase in R&D project spend and higher compensation expense. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, operating expenses were higher primarily due to compensation related expenses and increased project spend partially offset by decreased travel. Non GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up from 15.8% last quarter. The non GAAP tax rate of 14.8% was lower compared to last quarter and prior year, you can discrete tax benefits related to prior year return adjustments and release effects reserves. For the third quarter of 2020 gap net income was 170 $9 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Other income was the main driver for the difference between GAAP and non GAAP net income due to net gains from mark-to-market adjustments on our strategic investments primarily from our marketable equity securities. Additionally, in the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $152 million, capital expenditures were $48 million and free cash flow of $105 million. DS0 of 53 days compared to 55 days last quarter, in part due to increased collection. We repurchase the hundred and $25 million of common stock in the third quarter, with $295 million remaining for repurchase under our current plan. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $148 million. As we continue to navigate this pandemic, there are still uncertainties around the virus resurgence and rate of recovery. And therefore we will not provide guidance for the remainder of the year. Additionally, we are closely monitoring developments in the pandemic given the risk of new shutdowns in the U.S. and Europe. In the fourth quarter, we expect that sequencing run volumes will continue to improve modestly for clinical and research customers from the 96% and 82% levels, respectively in the third quarter. Again, we caution that this does not directly correlate to revenue. But data from the third quarter suggests customers are steadily returning to their labs, which will lead to increased activity. Consistent with the third quarter we expect fourth quarter sequential growth across all regions with China and APJ, showing flat the modest growth year-over-year. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we currently expect continued sequential improvements in revenue resulting from sequencing consumables being up modestly on a sequential basis as clinical and research activity continues to gradually improve. Sequencing instruments increasing sequentially, and the fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest quarter of the year for instrument placement. Sequencing service and other flat sequentially and microarrays up modestly on a sequential basis as we continue to see a gradual recovery and direct to consumer and genotyping applications. For the rest of the P&L, we expect sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in part driven by product mix with higher contribution from instrument sales. Sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses primarily driven by R&D project related expenses, compensation related expenses, and an extra week in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Non-GAAP EPS to be roughly flat compared to the third quarter of 2020, reflecting revenue improvements offset by lower gross margins and a sequential increase in operating and tax expenses. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Francis for some closing remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks Sam. As the global leader for sequencing platforms and consumables, we've seen our products enabled groundbreaking research programs and transformative clinical tests that have the potential to shift the paradigm in patient care. One of our largest opportunities for patient impact and revenue potential for years to come, is the ability for NGS to detect cancer early. Last month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire GRAIL, and we expect the acquisition to close in the second half of 2021. We believe our planned acquisition of GRAIL will accelerate a new era of early cancer detection, transforming cancer survivability, and opening up the largest clinical application of genomics we've seen. We look forward to welcoming our GRAIL colleagues to Illumina when the acquisition closes. Upon close, we expect to operate GRAIL as a division within Illumina. We remain committed to supporting all of the Illumina's customers and ensuring that innovators who wish to develop NGS based tests have continued access to our technologies. To conclude, the recovery of our business accelerated in the third quarter with significant sequencing consumables revenue growth, compared to the second quarter of 2020. And we expect continued consumables growth in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we're also making good progress, incorporating genomics into the standard of care, in oncology therapies, selection, NIPT, and genetic disease testing. And most importantly, we believe that we're laying a strong foundation for Illumina's near and long term growth. With that, we'll open the call up to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys. And thank you for taking the questions. The quarter was clearly better than most expected. I think, you even better than you guys probably thought in a lot of instances. I'm just wondering if you have a sense for how much of this was catch-up versus reflecting a new base to build off of moving forward? Based on your prepared remarks on Q4, both you Sam as well as you Francis, it does seem like this is kind of a new base to build off of given the momentum you've described heading into Q4. Is that is that fair?\nFrancis deSouza: Hi, Doug. Yes. I think that's fair. If we look at how this quarter played out, it certainly played out better than we expected based on how the first few weeks of the quarter were looking. So what we saw over the course of the quarter was an acceleration in the recovery in terms of the sequencing activity in both our clinical and research customers. And so, as we exited the quarter, I think we're at a new baseline that we will keep going into Q4. So I think it's fair to say that the recovery accelerated to create a new baseline for us going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to kind of hit on two things, just the elasticity on the consumable pricing cut, you highlighted a couple examples, for instance of customers that have come forward on the $600 genome and use it as a reason to buy no receipt. But I'm just curious as we think ahead into the next year, how much incremental demand do you think that that will drive? And to what degree will catalyze some of the projects that you hoped it would? And then on the instrument side, instruments are still down 23%? I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit on when you think they're really going to get back to grow?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, sure. So let me take both of those questions. So first, around the elasticity point, associated with the launch of Version 1.5 Reagent. So what Version 1.5 aim to do, and we saw, the effect in the quarter was really catalyzed some of the smaller core labs by giving them access to the $600 genome. The larger labs already had access to the $600 genome. So this was really a release targeted the smaller core labs. And the intent is to do two things. One, to unlock the elasticity and that part of the market. And so, we saw customers that were thinking about bigger projects. We saw customers that are moving to insource. And I talked about an example of that in the prepared remarks. The other thing that this release was intended to do was catalyzed an upgrade cycle in that segment of the market, the smaller core labs. And so, we started to see examples of customers that were either on older instruments or didn't have. So that could be on HiSeq, for example, or they didn't have sequencers. And because of this release, they were able to buy a Novaseq. Both of those dynamics, so catalyzing the elasticity of demand in terms of bigger projects, as well as driving an upgrade cycles are dynamics, we expect to continue to play out into Q4 and going into next year. And typically when we release a new price point into the market, a lower price point, initially there is a bit of a headwind. In this case, though, we expect it to be very short and that's how it's playing out where very quickly we're starting to see both of those positive dynamics start to play out. The second question you talked about was around instruments, and maybe I'll start and Sam, you can you can add to it. I talked a little bit in the prepared remarks that we saw really good activity from an instrument perspective. We were really pleased that throughout the course of the year, Q2, we saw an increase in NovaSeq shipments compared to Q1, Q3 was bigger than Q2. And so we continue to see growth in NovaSeq shipments plan over the course of this year from the base of Q1, and we saw strong demand in the mid-throughput instruments too. Maybe Sam, I'll turn it over to you to provide more color.\nSam Samad: Yes. I would say, in fact, we've been pleased with the sequencing instrument performance both in Q3 and the resilience that we've seen through the pandemic. We would expect that there would be a year-over-year declines, especially given the pandemic, given some pause on instrument purchases. But as we look towards Q4, we're expecting growth and instruments our strongest quarter of the year. We're expecting growth in terms of NovaSeq sequentially as well. And when I say growth in Q4, I mean sequentially in terms of instrument revenues. And then the pipeline looks really strong for both NextSeq 2000 and for NovaSeq.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions. I think the first one, obviously, there's been a big ramp in the operating expense in the second half of the year. As we think about going forward, is this something we should think about rolling into 2021. But even higher, as some of the T&E comes back in, the travel comes back in? And I guess some of the negative questions. The -- NIPT space, can you give us a sense of how many women that were covered under high risk actually were taking advantage? I mean, the women that were eligible for doing high risk, how many actually went into NIPT testing? And the reason why I asked is I'm just trying to get a sense of what the penetration would be for average risk manager sort of expanding coverage. Just trying to get some feel for the dynamics and how we can think about the NIPT business expanding? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Sam can add some color too. In terms of operating expenses, our philosophy over the course of the year has been to review our operating expenses very closely. And one of the things we want to do is make sure we continue to protect the high priority things that we were working on. So that includes our rich innovation pipeline. And so we've protected our projects associated with upcoming products, as well as some long term investments in the business. So we've protected those. But we've looked for other areas where we could make savings, some of those sort of naturally played out over the course of the pandemic in the form of reduced travel. For example, I think some of those, you're right, we'll come back next year. And so Sam will comment learn more about that. In terms of NIPT, obviously, it's a very regional story. But in the U.S. for example, you have a reasonably good penetration in terms of the women who are eligible for NIPT going to get it. So the majority of women who are eligible for the test do get it as part of their pregnancy. And so, the opening up of that market in the average risk segment does represent meaningful upside in terms of the actual demand for the test.\nSam Samad: Yes, Derik, with regards to OpEx, I would add just maybe a couple of points. And thanks for the question by the way. The one thing I would say is we've been incredibly focused and diligent in terms of managing our operating expenses, but at the same time really focused to Francis's point about not in any way undercutting our innovation -- our investment in innovation and in any way impacting our R&D pipeline. But for three quarters of the year, up until the end of Q3, I would say we're about $150 million below our own internal budget in terms of operating expense. So we have been very careful in terms of managing operating expenses. We're about 10% below. And as we look forward, yes, there will be some things that start to ramp back up. Things like again, as employees come into the lab, we will have R&D projects start to scale back up. That will continue into next year. And we'll have certain expenses as hopefully this pandemic eases like travel, that increase as well. But I would say in general, we've been extremely diligent and disciplined in terms of managing our expenses through year today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Hi, Francis. Thanks. And Sam, thanks for providing comments on 4Q, as well appreciate that. First question, recently, just within the last 24 hours we have been locked down in France and Europe. And these lock downs can potentially spread. Just wondering if that's contemplated in your expectations for the fourth quarter? And also, do you expect customers in Europe to be more adaptive this time around in terms of managing research and diagnostic sequencing operations now versus before? I just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And given that sequencing run rates that you described earlier as 96% of pre pandemic levels? Could we see a different standard here? And is this baked into your guidance? And then if you -- second question, if I could ask around GRAIL. One of the key questions that have emerged last week -- since this week, actually is the approach that Illumina took to GRAIL acquisition in light of another multi cancer liquid biopsy acquisition this week. I totally recognize that the acquisitions are pre revenue, but it appears that GRAIL is valued significantly higher versus thrive. So could you elaborate, if there's anything in terms of the overall market opportunity of the pre pen cancer test, or technical performance in the gallery or scale of studies or anything here that gives you a greater confidence and a higher valuation? Appreciate it.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks, Puneet. So I will start with your question around the potential restrictions in Europe, maybe even the U.S. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're monitoring that closely. Obviously, we all want to see the pandemic get under control. But there are definitely some signs in Europe that there are some potential shutdowns taking place, so at least additional restrictions. And so for Q4, we're monitoring that closely. We factored that in as we look forward in terms of our expectations for Q4. In fact we said, clinical sequencing activity in Q3 was 96% of pre pandemic levels. Research was 82% of pre pandemic levels, and we expect both of those to improve modestly, because of the fact that we're really tracking kind of how this pandemic evolves in Q4, and not to improve more than that.  With regards to your other point about customers being more adapt? I do think they are getting a bit more adapt in terms of learning to work with the virus, not to say that they're not obviously very careful and cautious about that. But at the same time, when you look at for instance, the number of labs that are now based on our Q3 data that are either completely open or in sort of some level of operation. It's about 90% of the labs compared to about 50%, back in April. So that doesn't mean that 90% is all full systems ahead, and they're all open. But there are either fully open or in restricted operations, it's about 90% of the total labs globally. So, they are really gradually ratcheting back up, but, in a cautious way, and that's what's factored into our expectation.\nSam Samad: And then, Puneet if I could comment on your GRAIL question. We talked about the fact that early detection of cancer represents by far the largest clinical application of genomics we're likely to see over the next decade or two. And we also talked about the fact that we expect many players in this market. And because it's such a large opportunity, and we expect players to take different approaches, whether it's, single cancer versus multi cancer or different technological approaches, and certainly we have a number of customers, including Thrive, Exact, but also Freenome and Guardant and other liquid biopsy players like Foundation Medicine, that we expect to play a role in this market going forward. And we will continue to support all of those customers going forward. What attracted us to GRAIL was its unique position in that market in terms of being the closest to having a commercial test. And in terms of having the performance characteristics consistent with being closest to have a commercial test. So GRAIL is looking to launch its test next year. And that'll likely make them the first player into the market. They've also undertaken by far some of the largest clinical studies in that space. And so they have over 100,000 people enrolled in the studies that they've done and generated quite a remarkable bolus of data associated with their test. And then the performance characteristics of their tests are very strong. So for the 12 deadliest cancers, they have a sensitivity in the high 60% with a false positive rate of less than 1%, which really does represent a best-in-class product at this time in the market. What also like too is that they're the only player at this point that has FDA approval in terms of being able to run an IDE study to return results to patients. And so they're working with some of the premier health care systems, including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland, Oregon Health System, the Intermountain health system, Dana Farber, Sutter Health. And so they already have their gallery test in the hands of doctors returning results to patients as part of their study. And so having that FDA approval is also very attractive. As and all of that obviously factored into the price associated with GRAIL.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Francis, on the All of Us sample that should begin to flow this quarter, is there a material consumables assumption that's built into that work for 4Q? And assuming that things do get going there, you thinking that that should be all sequencing? Or might there be some genotyping that makes it into the mix there? And if I could ask a quick follow-on. It sounds like you're ticking modest growth in China. Is in the picture for 4Q? Did you say a year over year, that would be a sequential step up there that we haven't seen in a while. So What's driving the confidence in the move, I guess back up to the mid 19 billion?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Let's starts with All of Us. For all of those, we expect the All of Us samples to start flowing to partner genome centers in Q4 and to start to see both sequencing in genotyping activity. From our perspective, the actual revenue contribution into Q4 we're expecting modest. But it's a very important step, because it then sets us up well for All of Us to ramp up more meaningfully going into next year. And so it means that the [Indiscernible] setup, workflow has been setup and machine is going into like. And so again, modest contribution in Q4, but that's a big step and sets us up we believe well going into next year. And then Sam, maybe you can talk about China.\nSam Samad: Yes. So Dan, thanks for the question. First of all. With regards to China we expect thing, I would say flattish year-over-year performance in Q4. So we said on the prepared remarks, for China and APJ flat to slightly increasing. So for China, specifically it's flattish performance year-over-year. In fact, China, the clinical performance has been strong year to-date and growing year-over-year. Research as we've talked about on previous calls has been impacted, definitely by the pandemic, repurposing some of the work towards PCR testing, and just the general impact of that on research. But we're pleased with the clinical performance that we've had in China. Q3 had strong instruments placements as well, in China, which bodes well for future activity. And so, pleased with the clinical performance there for sure. And that will give us confidence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So a couple of questions for you, Francis and Sam. On the sequencing consumables line you add some destocking in the second quarter. Did some sort of a restocking dynamic here play into that 29% quarter-over-quarter growth. And then an oncology, how are you thinking about sort of a bolus you're in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2021 as the missed screenings come back online?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks Tejas. With regards to stocking levels and restocking? Yes, in Q2, we had, some customers that destocks specifically in AMR, so that was an impact on our performance in Q2. We have not seen from our data that there's been an increase in inventories or restocking back into Q3. So essentially what we've seen and we've really looked at this with a lot of our customers, we've seen that customers are really purchasing through the demand that they have, but have not restocked back some of the destocking that occurred in Q2. Nor are we expecting in Q4 that there is restocking either. That they're going to continue based on the activity levels that we track and triangulating that back with revenues, we can see that essentially they're buying to their demand.\nSam Samad: And then, if we look at oncology. I mean, I think you bring up a really important point. I think one of the tragedies associated with the pandemic is that there are people who, frankly, aren't going in to get screened for cancer. And so, they're walking around with cancer developing. I think there are sort of two dynamics that will play out. One is there will be at some point to catch up, right? Unfortunately for those of those individuals, that means that cancer has progressed. But whether that plays out in Q4 or next year, there will be a catch up associated with people who haven't had their diagnosis yet. In addition, the other dynamic that's playing out is we're seeing that blood based tests are actually doing better through the course of the pandemic. So if we look at how the markets playing out, the service providers that offer blood based tests, have a proof that their business is more resilient through the pandemic than the service providers that do tissue based analysis. And so I think one of the things that's playing out through the course of the pandemic is you're starting to see an acceleration of blood as a sample type for cancer testing. So you're seeing an acceleration in the growth of liquid biopsies, which we think is a durable dynamic. And it's not just as a result of the pandemic, but we think that'll continue to play out in the coming years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess two quick ones. One, maybe I misheard this, but big fail, deal close. Is that a second half of next year? And I'm curious how we should be thinking about investments here. And then when you think about the system placements here, given this as razor blade model, and maybe perhaps elaborate on how the lower systems this year should play out next year? I do realize that the comps for consumables are easier. Should that offset the system declines for this year? I'm curious. \nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me touch on both and then add some color. If we saw on GRAIL, yes, we are expecting the deal to close in the second half of 2021, as we go through the regulatory process. We've talked a little bit about the dilution associated with GRAIL. But frankly, we'll have more information for you as the deal closes. And again, that's the second half of 2021. In terms of the instrument placements, we -- obviously, you're right, it is a razor blade model. And that's why it's important -- that's why we're so encouraged by the recovery we're seeing in instruments placements after we got out of Q1. And so the strength in NovaSeq placements to Q2, Q3, and certainly the pipeline, as we walk into Q4 is a very important. Similarly, the strength that we're seeing in the mid-throughput part of the portfolio, specifically NextSeq, both the new NextSeq 2000, as well as the 500 and the Dx boxes are a good sign for us as we look going into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Shelton with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Shelton: Hi. Thanks for the questions. I guess, two parter on the GRAIL studies. What's the timing next year in terms of when we can expect to see data from Pathfinder? And do you expect any performance degradation as you move into an all comers [ph] screening population for that study? And then second, for this Thrive study? I believe GRAIL completed enrollment in late 2018 and was following patients for 30 months. So is that something where we could see a readout at some point next year or that likely into 2022?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So we talked about the GRAIL studies. The easy answer is we don't expect the Pathfinder study to provide substantially different performance data than we have seen so far. And the reason for that is that GRAIL has done a number of other large scale studies. So the CCGA study had 15,000 people enrolled in the study. The second phase of that study was a prospective study and all comers study. And so given the size of the study, they've done with the same test. The performance data they've published externally is based on statistically significant data. So we didn't expect the Pathfinder data to reveal anything different. And in fact, before we signed the deal, we had a small group of people look at some of the early results or the mid-term results associated with Pathfinder. And while we won't probably about that. They're generally consistent with what we expect. And so we don't expect the final study results get published next year are then to be significantly different from the performance characteristics that you've seen so far. What was the second part of that question?\nSam Samad: With Thrive, Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So Thrive is a prospective study. It's a 100,000 women, fully enrolled about 18 months ago. So it's -- again, pretty far down, it's fast. And again, similarly given the size of the studies that have gone before, we expect this to be further validation in terms of the performance characteristics and not significantly different.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one on the PopSeq side. It's encouraging to see some of those bigger projects gaining momentum to get flowing here in the near term. Obviously, the timeline can slipped a few times now. Can you just talk to your confidence on these taking off on time, I guess, with the new 4Q timelines, particularly All of Us. And are those trajectories similar to kind of what you've talked about before? All of us I think, for example, at the beginning of the year, you kind of talked about 60,000 whole genomes in the first six months. Are we still thinking that the trajectories in the same once you do get launched? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. It's a good question. And as we look at where we are with those population studies, now, I'll touch on sort of the four big ones, right?. So the UK Biobank, the million veterans, all of us and the UK NHS. And where we are now is that walking into next year, the majority of them have already been stood up, and it's a matter of just either getting back to where they were, which is, for example, the UK Biobank, or just ramping up volumes of samples. That's a much better place to be than we were last year, for example, where all of us still have to get FDA approval, and then work out the workflows to get the samples flowing to its partner genome centers. And so if I look at all of them, the UK Biobank it actually they entered the year, equencing at a high capacity, they pulled back in March because of the pandemic, and they're starting to ramp back up going into next year. And so, assuming conditions are good, we have high confidence in their ability to ramp up quickly. We talked about the fact that the million veterans program has been remarkably resilient over the course of the year, and in fact, has increased its scope over the course of this year. All of us we took samples of are flowing in Q4. And so really, it is all about just scaling up next year, which is a pretty good place to be in terms of actually getting it going. And then the UK NHS for this year, has been on hold primarily as the NHS has been dealing with the pandemic testing that they're doing. But they are expected also to start sequencing later this quarter. And so, that puts us we believe in a good position to start to see the scale up going into next year. So across all four, we feel really good that as we end this year, all of them will be in a position where they are processing samples and ready to scale up and deal with the pent up demand that they've had.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. Just a couple on the expense side. One, can you elaborate on what's happening on the gross margin line both the driver of the sequential downtick and the further downtick expected in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, can you talk about the anticipation of the GRAIL acquisition, philosophically change any of your thinking around base Illumina budgeting as you roll into 2021? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, thanks, Dan, for the question. So with regards to gross margin first of all. The downtick from Q2 to Q3 was really expected for our expectation. So, gross margin came in at slightly better than our expectation. And that was driven by some additional -- we have some additional freight expenses, some additional compensation expenses in our operations organization. And also some of the ramp on the project as well had some additional impact on gross margin or cost. So that's perfect our expectation. The Q4 downtick sequentially versus Q3, it's really mostly driven by mix. And the fact that we have a instrument quarter that's strong, that outweighs some of the benefits from the consumables, mix is impacted negatively by that. With regards to the expectations for 2021. Really, when we think about the core business and Illumina, there's really not a material change in terms of our budget, philosophy and approach. We are absolutely focused on continuing to invest in the core business and also generating the shareholder returns that we were committed to end the core business, to continue to drive, support that over time. But at the same time, we have a really compelling opportunity with GRAIL, and we're going to continue -- we're going to invest behind that opportunity. It's going to be diluted in the next few years, but we're committed. So not a major change in terms of our budgeting philosophy for 2021 on the core business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, we appreciate kind of your long term expectations of double digit growth and consumables, sequencing consumables. Can you quantify how much of that is clinical and specifically, oncology is a component of growth? And then it's kind of a follow up to that. Can you quantify or maybe even disqualify the opportunity of moving from panels -- to panels from hotspot testing in terms of just growth there? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Sure, David. So maybe I'll start by saying that. As we entered this year, we talked about the fact that clinical business represents just under half of our sequencing consumables. But we also talked about the fact that that part of our business is growing significantly faster than the research side of our business. And so, you should expect those lines to cross and once they cross they aren't going back. The sequencing consumables from the clinical business is going to be the majority of our sequencing consumables both in dollars and in growth going forward. Off those sequencing consumables from the clinic, oncology testing for therapy selection represents the biggest part of that market. And so, we haven't -- you should expect that to continue going forward. You have long term numbers there, but you should expect that to continue to be the biggest part of the sequencing tools in the clinic going forward. We do expect for a number of reasons to continue to see the migration from hotspots to larger panels, and frankly, from not just hot, but the smaller panels to larger panels too and that's driven by in a number of things, including the increasing use of TMB, as a biomarker for therapies. And so, if you look at what happened with Keytruda for example, in the last few months, that continues to add momentum to say, it's not enough just to look at gene hotspots to prescribe a therapy, but you need to look at things like TMB, and that will require the use of larger panels. And so, you take that. You take the fact that you're seeing. When and I talked about ASMO, for example, you're seeing momentum and guidelines to use biomarkers like TMB. And all of that will continue to drive momentum to the larger panels, which will then drive more sequencing and will make oncology testing grow even faster, and therefore be a bigger component of the sequencing consumable revenue going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Francis, could you just give us a sense of the upgrade opportunity that still remains ahead of you for your smaller customers that are in the HiSeq. I guess we haven't gotten to that in a while, particularly in light of the price cut and in the comments this quarter about the strong demand on SSE that you saw. So any color regarding the size of that opportunity, and what are early tracks and look like this quarter? And kind of how do you think that upgrade opportunity evolves as we look out? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Maybe I'll start with sort of a qualitative view and we can work our way through that. So, when we talked about sort of the multi year upgrade opportunity for NovaSeq there is this next segment that we're activating, starting with the Version 1.5 Reagent, which is the smaller core labs. They're the ones that are still primary still using the HiSeq. And frankly, they haven't had the volume to justify the upgrade because you need both to see the benefits associated with the consumables drop in cost. So 1.5 now changes the economics for them. And that's the segment of the customer base that we're looking to activate. It's been a while in terms of a number of incidents, so maybe I'll turn it over to you, Sam to give us some color on that.\nSam Samad: Yes. Maybe the color I'll give, Dan, and thanks for the question. As we think about the NovaSeq placements, I know we used to give more specificity around this when we first launched NovaSeq and the number of HiSeq customers that we still expect to take on NovaSeq. But we haven't provided that for some time. But the metric I will give you is for NovaSeq placements year to-date. We're still seeing roughly 40%-ish or so coming from new-to-Illumina customers. So really a great sign around the democratization of sequencing that NovaSeq has done. We're seeing about an additional 40% or so that's coming from NovaSeq capacity upgrades. So existing, obviously customers that are just upgrading or taking on more capacity. And then, roughly 20% or so from those HiSeq customers that are continuing to transition to NovaSeq. So that's still going on. We're going to continue to see that. The V 1.5 upgrade that we talked about will also help catalyze that as well, will drive that as well. So still very encouraging and good room to offset.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nJuliet Cunningham: Thank you. And as a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section, as well as through the dial in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining the call today. This concludes our call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Juliet. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We saw a strong rebound in our business in the third quarter with a faster recovery than we expected in both our clinical and research customers. Total revenue for the third quarter was $794 million, up 26% sequentially and down 12% compared to the prior year period. I'll share that the quarter highlight and Sam will provide more detailed financials. Sequencing revenue grew 25% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequencing consumables grew 29% sequentially with strength across our high, mid and low throughput product portfolio. NextSeq momentum continued to build. With mid throughput consumables growing both sequentially and 3% year-over-year, and we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter. Sequencing instruments also outperformed expectations with revenue up 24% sequentially. This growth was primarily driven by increased shipments of NovaSeq and NextSeq platforms. NovaSeq purchases have rebounded nicely from Q1 and some customers delaying purchases as shelter-in-place policies took effect. We have pleased with the sequential growth in NovaSeq shipments in each quarter since Q1. We're entering the fourth quarter with a strong NovaSeq pipeline and expect this sequential growth to continue in Q4. In addition, we had another successful quarter for our mid throughput portfolio with both NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 550 exceeding our expectations. Strong demand for these flexible sequencers led to record mid throughput shipments in the third quarter. We're especially pleased with the success of the NextSeq 2000 launch reflecting positive customer feedback and demand. Approximately one-third of the NextSeq 2000 placements are coming from new-to-Illumina customers. Consistent with our expectations, we've seen little cannibalization of NovaSeq conversions among the remaining HiSeq customers. Sequencing service and other revenue grew 9% sequentially and was 28% lower compared to the prior year, due to one-time IVD licensing and development revenue of over $30 million in the third quarter of last year. Total Microarray revenue of $86 million without 28% sequentially as direct-to-consumer customers and other applications began recovering from pandemic related headwinds. Turning to our customer segments. We saw solid improvement in both clinical and research activity. As a reminder, we track sequencing run rate as an indicator of general activity. Run volumes are based on sampling and do not directly correlate with revenue. The intent of providing this metric is to help investors understand customer sequencing activity. Clinical sequencing run volumes increased from an average of 84% in the second quarter to 96% during the third quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. In oncology, we're encouraged by signs of point to continued adoption of NGS in cancer treatment. The European Society for Medical Oncology or ESMO, became the first scientific society to issue recommendations for the use of NGS in oncology. Depending on the cancer type that society recommends NGS for large multi-gene panels for the determination of tumor mutation burden and to screen patients for clinical trials. Today, TSO 500 which is for research use only, provide comprehensive genomic profiling and has been adopted by approximately 250 customers. We're excited to release a CE-IVD-marked TSO comprehensive assay in 2021 labs can follow ESMO guidelines and continue to improve cancer patient outcomes. Growing payer option will continue to broaden the availability of these tests. Last month Aetna covering 19 million lives, announced coverage for large panel comprehensive genomic profiling for both solid and liquid including testing for TMB. We're also encouraged by the increasing availability and adoption for NGS-based liquid biopsy test. The recent FDA approval for Guardant360 and FoundationOne Liquid CDx demonstrate the clinical utility of these technologies that detect cell free DNA from the tumor in the blood and can provide comprehensive genomic profiling and tumor tissue if not available. Liquid biopsy panels like these broaden access to more patients who can benefit from NGS in their cancer treatment. Reproductive health showed strength in the quarter growing sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, during the third quarter reproductive health averaged over 100% of its pre-pandemic run rate. We expect sustained growth as reimbursement prospects have never looked more promising. Recently, ACOG updated its guidance to recommend the NIPT be made available to all pregnant women, regardless of maternal age or baseline risk. This is a major milestone, and we expect payers to continue to follow ACOG'S guidance, adding to the already $130 million plus lives covered for average risk in the U.S. Centene for example, recently aligned its guidelines, adding average risk coverage to an additional 23 million lives in the U.S. Centene is also the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the U.S. Meaning this coverage decision will bring NIPT as an option to more medically underserved areas and populations. In genetic disease testing, physicians, insurance companies and governments around the globe are increasingly adopting sequencing to diagnose children suspected of having genetic conditions. We're seeing solid progress on the reimbursement front. Payer adoption in the U.S. continues to grow. With more than double the lives covered for whole genome sequencing than at the start of the year. And Australia recently announced that it will reimburse whole exome or genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause of intellectual disabilities. These positive developments give us confidence and sustained long term growth in this under penetrated market. Turning to research sequencing runs show continued improvement and increase from an average of 65% in the second quarter to 82% in the third quarter, compared to its pre-pandemic run volumes. We're encouraged to see researchers returning to their labs and reopening, and this level of improvement exceeded our expectations. Within research, we're seeing the role of NGS take shape in infectious disease. We believe the most likely near term use case for sequencing is in research and surveillance for projects like Australia's first national COVID-19 tracking system, which aims to sequence the virus genomes of all positive COVID-19 tests in Australia. And track COVID-19 using genomics across the country. NIH is also increasing its funding for understanding COVID-19 and the transmission pathway using genomic testing. We continue to believe COVID-19 testing will be primarily served by PCR and antigen tests, with NGS providing supplemental testing capacity. As such, we're not factoring in the material contribution to revenue in the fourth quarter from COVID-19 testing. On the population genomics front, we're seeing promising signs of progress. All of us received its IDE approval from the FDA in the second quarter. And as expected, samples started to flow from the Biobank to partner genome centers. We expect the project to ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2021. During the third quarter, sequencing for the UK Biobank continued, and we expect levels to gradually return to normal and sequencing to continue into 2021. And we expect whole genome sequencing services for the NHS genomic medicine service to commence later this quarter. Given the NHS is current focus on COVID, we expect this program to gradually ramp over the next few quarters. Perhaps one of the most resilient popGen programs in the face of the pandemic has been the Million Veteran Program or MVP. The project aims to provide insight on how genetics, lifestyle and military exposures affect health and wellness. And has recently expanded its targeted enrollment from 1 million to 2 million veterans. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through a sequencing partner personalities expects to cross the hundred thousand whole genome milestone before the end of the year. We believe these and other initiatives will expand our markets and create exciting new opportunities for Illumina. We are committed to continuing to lead to innovation with new product launches to support the markets and customers we serve, including NovaSeq 6000 version 1.5 agents, which were launched during the third quarter. This release offers increased shelf life, improved quality scores, longer indices, and most importantly, it makes the $600 genome more broadly available to help smaller labs be successful and provides additional incentives for labs to upgrade from Hiseq to NovaSeq. NovaSeq 6000 version 1.5 reagents have been extremely well received by our customers. For example, the princess Maximus Center, the largest national pediatric oncology center in Europe was outsourcing its genome sequencing to a collaborator. But with the new reagents, they were able to purchase a NovaSeq and can now start to perform testing in house, meaning potentially care altering genomic information will reach children with cancer faster, and perform closer to the patient. The longer read lines, combined with high throughput scale, enable the Canadian biotech company to adopt the Novaseq 6000 for the development of antibody products for potential COVID-19 therapy. We're preparing to launch NextSeq 1000 this quarter. NextSeq 1000 enables lower throughput customers to adopt our newest platform as an entry point with the ability to field upgrade during the NextSeq 2000. We're also launching the P3 flow cells this quarter. Early Access P3 customers, including academic core labs are already using the flow cell for routine sequencing methods in mid sized research projects to enable faster turnaround times. Other customers are using P3 to develop workflows in single cell epigenetics and spatial transcriptomics. These are examples of how we continue to execute on our current and future plans, throughout these challenging times to advance our mission and create long term shareholder value. Now, I'll hand the call over to Sam to discuss the third quarter financials. Thanks Sam. As the global leader for sequencing platforms and consumables, we've seen our products enabled groundbreaking research programs and transformative clinical tests that have the potential to shift the paradigm in patient care. One of our largest opportunities for patient impact and revenue potential for years to come, is the ability for NGS to detect cancer early. Last month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire GRAIL, and we expect the acquisition to close in the second half of 2021. We believe our planned acquisition of GRAIL will accelerate a new era of early cancer detection, transforming cancer survivability, and opening up the largest clinical application of genomics we've seen. We look forward to welcoming our GRAIL colleagues to Illumina when the acquisition closes. Upon close, we expect to operate GRAIL as a division within Illumina. We remain committed to supporting all of the Illumina's customers and ensuring that innovators who wish to develop NGS based tests have continued access to our technologies. To conclude, the recovery of our business accelerated in the third quarter with significant sequencing consumables revenue growth, compared to the second quarter of 2020. And we expect continued consumables growth in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we're also making good progress, incorporating genomics into the standard of care, in oncology therapies, selection, NIPT, and genetic disease testing. And most importantly, we believe that we're laying a strong foundation for Illumina's near and long term growth. With that, we'll open the call up to Q&A. Hi, Doug. Yes. I think that's fair. If we look at how this quarter played out, it certainly played out better than we expected based on how the first few weeks of the quarter were looking. So what we saw over the course of the quarter was an acceleration in the recovery in terms of the sequencing activity in both our clinical and research customers. And so, as we exited the quarter, I think we're at a new baseline that we will keep going into Q4. So I think it's fair to say that the recovery accelerated to create a new baseline for us going forward. Yes, sure. So let me take both of those questions. So first, around the elasticity point, associated with the launch of Version 1.5 Reagent. So what Version 1.5 aim to do, and we saw, the effect in the quarter was really catalyzed some of the smaller core labs by giving them access to the $600 genome. The larger labs already had access to the $600 genome. So this was really a release targeted the smaller core labs. And the intent is to do two things. One, to unlock the elasticity and that part of the market. And so, we saw customers that were thinking about bigger projects. We saw customers that are moving to insource. And I talked about an example of that in the prepared remarks. The other thing that this release was intended to do was catalyzed an upgrade cycle in that segment of the market, the smaller core labs. And so, we started to see examples of customers that were either on older instruments or didn't have. So that could be on HiSeq, for example, or they didn't have sequencers. And because of this release, they were able to buy a Novaseq. Both of those dynamics, so catalyzing the elasticity of demand in terms of bigger projects, as well as driving an upgrade cycles are dynamics, we expect to continue to play out into Q4 and going into next year. And typically when we release a new price point into the market, a lower price point, initially there is a bit of a headwind. In this case, though, we expect it to be very short and that's how it's playing out where very quickly we're starting to see both of those positive dynamics start to play out. The second question you talked about was around instruments, and maybe I'll start and Sam, you can you can add to it. I talked a little bit in the prepared remarks that we saw really good activity from an instrument perspective. We were really pleased that throughout the course of the year, Q2, we saw an increase in NovaSeq shipments compared to Q1, Q3 was bigger than Q2. And so we continue to see growth in NovaSeq shipments plan over the course of this year from the base of Q1, and we saw strong demand in the mid-throughput instruments too. Maybe Sam, I'll turn it over to you to provide more color. Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Sam can add some color too. In terms of operating expenses, our philosophy over the course of the year has been to review our operating expenses very closely. And one of the things we want to do is make sure we continue to protect the high priority things that we were working on. So that includes our rich innovation pipeline. And so we've protected our projects associated with upcoming products, as well as some long term investments in the business. So we've protected those. But we've looked for other areas where we could make savings, some of those sort of naturally played out over the course of the pandemic in the form of reduced travel. For example, I think some of those, you're right, we'll come back next year. And so Sam will comment learn more about that. In terms of NIPT, obviously, it's a very regional story. But in the U.S. for example, you have a reasonably good penetration in terms of the women who are eligible for NIPT going to get it. So the majority of women who are eligible for the test do get it as part of their pregnancy. And so, the opening up of that market in the average risk segment does represent meaningful upside in terms of the actual demand for the test. Yes. Thanks, Puneet. So I will start with your question around the potential restrictions in Europe, maybe even the U.S. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're monitoring that closely. Obviously, we all want to see the pandemic get under control. But there are definitely some signs in Europe that there are some potential shutdowns taking place, so at least additional restrictions. And so for Q4, we're monitoring that closely. We factored that in as we look forward in terms of our expectations for Q4. In fact we said, clinical sequencing activity in Q3 was 96% of pre pandemic levels. Research was 82% of pre pandemic levels, and we expect both of those to improve modestly, because of the fact that we're really tracking kind of how this pandemic evolves in Q4, and not to improve more than that.  With regards to your other point about customers being more adapt? I do think they are getting a bit more adapt in terms of learning to work with the virus, not to say that they're not obviously very careful and cautious about that. But at the same time, when you look at for instance, the number of labs that are now based on our Q3 data that are either completely open or in sort of some level of operation. It's about 90% of the labs compared to about 50%, back in April. So that doesn't mean that 90% is all full systems ahead, and they're all open. But there are either fully open or in restricted operations, it's about 90% of the total labs globally. So, they are really gradually ratcheting back up, but, in a cautious way, and that's what's factored into our expectation. Yes. Let's starts with All of Us. For all of those, we expect the All of Us samples to start flowing to partner genome centers in Q4 and to start to see both sequencing in genotyping activity. From our perspective, the actual revenue contribution into Q4 we're expecting modest. But it's a very important step, because it then sets us up well for All of Us to ramp up more meaningfully going into next year. And so it means that the [Indiscernible] setup, workflow has been setup and machine is going into like. And so again, modest contribution in Q4, but that's a big step and sets us up we believe well going into next year. And then Sam, maybe you can talk about China. Yes. Thanks Tejas. With regards to stocking levels and restocking? Yes, in Q2, we had, some customers that destocks specifically in AMR, so that was an impact on our performance in Q2. We have not seen from our data that there's been an increase in inventories or restocking back into Q3. So essentially what we've seen and we've really looked at this with a lot of our customers, we've seen that customers are really purchasing through the demand that they have, but have not restocked back some of the destocking that occurred in Q2. Nor are we expecting in Q4 that there is restocking either. That they're going to continue based on the activity levels that we track and triangulating that back with revenues, we can see that essentially they're buying to their demand. Yes. So let me touch on both and then add some color. If we saw on GRAIL, yes, we are expecting the deal to close in the second half of 2021, as we go through the regulatory process. We've talked a little bit about the dilution associated with GRAIL. But frankly, we'll have more information for you as the deal closes. And again, that's the second half of 2021. In terms of the instrument placements, we -- obviously, you're right, it is a razor blade model. And that's why it's important -- that's why we're so encouraged by the recovery we're seeing in instruments placements after we got out of Q1. And so the strength in NovaSeq placements to Q2, Q3, and certainly the pipeline, as we walk into Q4 is a very important. Similarly, the strength that we're seeing in the mid-throughput part of the portfolio, specifically NextSeq, both the new NextSeq 2000, as well as the 500 and the Dx boxes are a good sign for us as we look going into next year. Yes. So we talked about the GRAIL studies. The easy answer is we don't expect the Pathfinder study to provide substantially different performance data than we have seen so far. And the reason for that is that GRAIL has done a number of other large scale studies. So the CCGA study had 15,000 people enrolled in the study. The second phase of that study was a prospective study and all comers study. And so given the size of the study, they've done with the same test. The performance data they've published externally is based on statistically significant data. So we didn't expect the Pathfinder data to reveal anything different. And in fact, before we signed the deal, we had a small group of people look at some of the early results or the mid-term results associated with Pathfinder. And while we won't probably about that. They're generally consistent with what we expect. And so we don't expect the final study results get published next year are then to be significantly different from the performance characteristics that you've seen so far. What was the second part of that question? Yes. So Thrive is a prospective study. It's a 100,000 women, fully enrolled about 18 months ago. So it's -- again, pretty far down, it's fast. And again, similarly given the size of the studies that have gone before, we expect this to be further validation in terms of the performance characteristics and not significantly different. Yes. It's a good question. And as we look at where we are with those population studies, now, I'll touch on sort of the four big ones, right?. So the UK Biobank, the million veterans, all of us and the UK NHS. And where we are now is that walking into next year, the majority of them have already been stood up, and it's a matter of just either getting back to where they were, which is, for example, the UK Biobank, or just ramping up volumes of samples. That's a much better place to be than we were last year, for example, where all of us still have to get FDA approval, and then work out the workflows to get the samples flowing to its partner genome centers. And so if I look at all of them, the UK Biobank it actually they entered the year, equencing at a high capacity, they pulled back in March because of the pandemic, and they're starting to ramp back up going into next year. And so, assuming conditions are good, we have high confidence in their ability to ramp up quickly. We talked about the fact that the million veterans program has been remarkably resilient over the course of the year, and in fact, has increased its scope over the course of this year. All of us we took samples of are flowing in Q4. And so really, it is all about just scaling up next year, which is a pretty good place to be in terms of actually getting it going. And then the UK NHS for this year, has been on hold primarily as the NHS has been dealing with the pandemic testing that they're doing. But they are expected also to start sequencing later this quarter. And so, that puts us we believe in a good position to start to see the scale up going into next year. So across all four, we feel really good that as we end this year, all of them will be in a position where they are processing samples and ready to scale up and deal with the pent up demand that they've had. Yes, thanks, Dan, for the question. So with regards to gross margin first of all. The downtick from Q2 to Q3 was really expected for our expectation. So, gross margin came in at slightly better than our expectation. And that was driven by some additional -- we have some additional freight expenses, some additional compensation expenses in our operations organization. And also some of the ramp on the project as well had some additional impact on gross margin or cost. So that's perfect our expectation. The Q4 downtick sequentially versus Q3, it's really mostly driven by mix. And the fact that we have a instrument quarter that's strong, that outweighs some of the benefits from the consumables, mix is impacted negatively by that. With regards to the expectations for 2021. Really, when we think about the core business and Illumina, there's really not a material change in terms of our budget, philosophy and approach. We are absolutely focused on continuing to invest in the core business and also generating the shareholder returns that we were committed to end the core business, to continue to drive, support that over time. But at the same time, we have a really compelling opportunity with GRAIL, and we're going to continue -- we're going to invest behind that opportunity. It's going to be diluted in the next few years, but we're committed. So not a major change in terms of our budgeting philosophy for 2021 on the core business. Yes. Sure, David. So maybe I'll start by saying that. As we entered this year, we talked about the fact that clinical business represents just under half of our sequencing consumables. But we also talked about the fact that that part of our business is growing significantly faster than the research side of our business. And so, you should expect those lines to cross and once they cross they aren't going back. The sequencing consumables from the clinical business is going to be the majority of our sequencing consumables both in dollars and in growth going forward. Off those sequencing consumables from the clinic, oncology testing for therapy selection represents the biggest part of that market. And so, we haven't -- you should expect that to continue going forward. You have long term numbers there, but you should expect that to continue to be the biggest part of the sequencing tools in the clinic going forward. We do expect for a number of reasons to continue to see the migration from hotspots to larger panels, and frankly, from not just hot, but the smaller panels to larger panels too and that's driven by in a number of things, including the increasing use of TMB, as a biomarker for therapies. And so, if you look at what happened with Keytruda for example, in the last few months, that continues to add momentum to say, it's not enough just to look at gene hotspots to prescribe a therapy, but you need to look at things like TMB, and that will require the use of larger panels. And so, you take that. You take the fact that you're seeing. When and I talked about ASMO, for example, you're seeing momentum and guidelines to use biomarkers like TMB. And all of that will continue to drive momentum to the larger panels, which will then drive more sequencing and will make oncology testing grow even faster, and therefore be a bigger component of the sequencing consumable revenue going forward. Yes. Maybe I'll start with sort of a qualitative view and we can work our way through that. So, when we talked about sort of the multi year upgrade opportunity for NovaSeq there is this next segment that we're activating, starting with the Version 1.5 Reagent, which is the smaller core labs. They're the ones that are still primary still using the HiSeq. And frankly, they haven't had the volume to justify the upgrade because you need both to see the benefits associated with the consumables drop in cost. So 1.5 now changes the economics for them. And that's the segment of the customer base that we're looking to activate. It's been a while in terms of a number of incidents, so maybe I'll turn it over to you, Sam to give us some color on that."

            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As discussed, third quarter 2020 revenue was $794 million, the 12% decline year-over-year, but a 26% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. While the global pandemic continued to impact our business, we saw encouraging signs of recovery within both clinical and research customers. Sequencing consumables revenue of $500 million was up 29% sequentially, and down 5% compared to the prior year period. Quarter-over-quarter growth of $113 million reflected significant improvement across high, mid and low throughput platforms. With NovaSeq flow through returning to over 1 million per system per year. Our mid-throughput sequencing consumables grew in the quarter versus the same period last year. Total sequencing system revenue of and $109 million was ahead of our expectations with both NovaSeq and our mid throughput platforms exceeding our expectations at the start of the quarter. The third quarter was also a record quarter for mid-throughput shipments driven by customer demand for NextSeq 2000 and the NextSeq 550 Dx platform. In fact, NextSeq shipments represented over 40% of NextSeq 550 shipments year to date. Since 2013, Illumina has shipped over 1000 Dx instruments reflecting the growing clinical nature of our customer base. Sequencing service and other revenue of $99 million was lower compared to the third quarter of 2019. Total sequencing revenue was $708 million and represented 89% of total revenue. Finally, total microarray revenue of $86 million was down 16% from the third quarter of 2019, reflecting lower consumables and services revenue, primarily driven by COVID-19 related headwinds. Turning to the region's, Americas revenue of $436 million was ahead of expectations and grew over $130 or 30%.compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequential growth was driven by both research and clinical customers as labs continued to reopen and clinical activity increased. In fact, clinical sequencing consumables grew modestly compared to the prior year period, as demand started to recover after delays and testing in the second quarter. EMEA revenue of $230 million was up $45 million, compared to the second quarter of 2020, with strength and sequencing consumables, which grew compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven by a strong rebound in both clinical and research customers. China revenue grew sequentially to $83 million driven by strength in instrument placements. APJ revenue was roughly flat year-over-year at $62 million and increased $11 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. With NIPT helping to lead the recovery with sequential and year-over-year growth. Moving through the P&L, I will highlight non-GAAP results that includes stock based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 67.4% was lower as expected on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by IVD partnership revenue in the third quarter of 2019 not repeating this year, and lower volume and higher freight costs associated with the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $365 million were higher compared to the second quarter of 2020, and the same quarter last year. Sequential growth was driven as expected by an increase in R&D project spend and higher compensation expense. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, operating expenses were higher primarily due to compensation related expenses and increased project spend partially offset by decreased travel. Non GAAP operating margin was 21.4%, up from 15.8% last quarter. The non GAAP tax rate of 14.8% was lower compared to last quarter and prior year, you can discrete tax benefits related to prior year return adjustments and release effects reserves. For the third quarter of 2020 gap net income was 170 $9 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Other income was the main driver for the difference between GAAP and non GAAP net income due to net gains from mark-to-market adjustments on our strategic investments primarily from our marketable equity securities. Additionally, in the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $152 million, capital expenditures were $48 million and free cash flow of $105 million. DS0 of 53 days compared to 55 days last quarter, in part due to increased collection. We repurchase the hundred and $25 million of common stock in the third quarter, with $295 million remaining for repurchase under our current plan. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $148 million. As we continue to navigate this pandemic, there are still uncertainties around the virus resurgence and rate of recovery. And therefore we will not provide guidance for the remainder of the year. Additionally, we are closely monitoring developments in the pandemic given the risk of new shutdowns in the U.S. and Europe. In the fourth quarter, we expect that sequencing run volumes will continue to improve modestly for clinical and research customers from the 96% and 82% levels, respectively in the third quarter. Again, we caution that this does not directly correlate to revenue. But data from the third quarter suggests customers are steadily returning to their labs, which will lead to increased activity. Consistent with the third quarter we expect fourth quarter sequential growth across all regions with China and APJ, showing flat the modest growth year-over-year. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we currently expect continued sequential improvements in revenue resulting from sequencing consumables being up modestly on a sequential basis as clinical and research activity continues to gradually improve. Sequencing instruments increasing sequentially, and the fourth quarter is expected to be the strongest quarter of the year for instrument placement. Sequencing service and other flat sequentially and microarrays up modestly on a sequential basis as we continue to see a gradual recovery and direct to consumer and genotyping applications. For the rest of the P&L, we expect sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in part driven by product mix with higher contribution from instrument sales. Sequential increase in non-GAAP operating expenses primarily driven by R&D project related expenses, compensation related expenses, and an extra week in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Non-GAAP EPS to be roughly flat compared to the third quarter of 2020, reflecting revenue improvements offset by lower gross margins and a sequential increase in operating and tax expenses. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Francis for some closing remarks. Yes. I would say, in fact, we've been pleased with the sequencing instrument performance both in Q3 and the resilience that we've seen through the pandemic. We would expect that there would be a year-over-year declines, especially given the pandemic, given some pause on instrument purchases. But as we look towards Q4, we're expecting growth and instruments our strongest quarter of the year. We're expecting growth in terms of NovaSeq sequentially as well. And when I say growth in Q4, I mean sequentially in terms of instrument revenues. And then the pipeline looks really strong for both NextSeq 2000 and for NovaSeq. Yes, Derik, with regards to OpEx, I would add just maybe a couple of points. And thanks for the question by the way. The one thing I would say is we've been incredibly focused and diligent in terms of managing our operating expenses, but at the same time really focused to Francis's point about not in any way undercutting our innovation -- our investment in innovation and in any way impacting our R&D pipeline. But for three quarters of the year, up until the end of Q3, I would say we're about $150 million below our own internal budget in terms of operating expense. So we have been very careful in terms of managing operating expenses. We're about 10% below. And as we look forward, yes, there will be some things that start to ramp back up. Things like again, as employees come into the lab, we will have R&D projects start to scale back up. That will continue into next year. And we'll have certain expenses as hopefully this pandemic eases like travel, that increase as well. But I would say in general, we've been extremely diligent and disciplined in terms of managing our expenses through year today. And then, Puneet if I could comment on your GRAIL question. We talked about the fact that early detection of cancer represents by far the largest clinical application of genomics we're likely to see over the next decade or two. And we also talked about the fact that we expect many players in this market. And because it's such a large opportunity, and we expect players to take different approaches, whether it's, single cancer versus multi cancer or different technological approaches, and certainly we have a number of customers, including Thrive, Exact, but also Freenome and Guardant and other liquid biopsy players like Foundation Medicine, that we expect to play a role in this market going forward. And we will continue to support all of those customers going forward. What attracted us to GRAIL was its unique position in that market in terms of being the closest to having a commercial test. And in terms of having the performance characteristics consistent with being closest to have a commercial test. So GRAIL is looking to launch its test next year. And that'll likely make them the first player into the market. They've also undertaken by far some of the largest clinical studies in that space. And so they have over 100,000 people enrolled in the studies that they've done and generated quite a remarkable bolus of data associated with their test. And then the performance characteristics of their tests are very strong. So for the 12 deadliest cancers, they have a sensitivity in the high 60% with a false positive rate of less than 1%, which really does represent a best-in-class product at this time in the market. What also like too is that they're the only player at this point that has FDA approval in terms of being able to run an IDE study to return results to patients. And so they're working with some of the premier health care systems, including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland, Oregon Health System, the Intermountain health system, Dana Farber, Sutter Health. And so they already have their gallery test in the hands of doctors returning results to patients as part of their study. And so having that FDA approval is also very attractive. As and all of that obviously factored into the price associated with GRAIL. Yes. So Dan, thanks for the question. First of all. With regards to China we expect thing, I would say flattish year-over-year performance in Q4. So we said on the prepared remarks, for China and APJ flat to slightly increasing. So for China, specifically it's flattish performance year-over-year. In fact, China, the clinical performance has been strong year to-date and growing year-over-year. Research as we've talked about on previous calls has been impacted, definitely by the pandemic, repurposing some of the work towards PCR testing, and just the general impact of that on research. But we're pleased with the clinical performance that we've had in China. Q3 had strong instruments placements as well, in China, which bodes well for future activity. And so, pleased with the clinical performance there for sure. And that will give us confidence. And then, if we look at oncology. I mean, I think you bring up a really important point. I think one of the tragedies associated with the pandemic is that there are people who, frankly, aren't going in to get screened for cancer. And so, they're walking around with cancer developing. I think there are sort of two dynamics that will play out. One is there will be at some point to catch up, right? Unfortunately for those of those individuals, that means that cancer has progressed. But whether that plays out in Q4 or next year, there will be a catch up associated with people who haven't had their diagnosis yet. In addition, the other dynamic that's playing out is we're seeing that blood based tests are actually doing better through the course of the pandemic. So if we look at how the markets playing out, the service providers that offer blood based tests, have a proof that their business is more resilient through the pandemic than the service providers that do tissue based analysis. And so I think one of the things that's playing out through the course of the pandemic is you're starting to see an acceleration of blood as a sample type for cancer testing. So you're seeing an acceleration in the growth of liquid biopsies, which we think is a durable dynamic. And it's not just as a result of the pandemic, but we think that'll continue to play out in the coming years. With Thrive, Francis. Yes. Maybe the color I'll give, Dan, and thanks for the question. As we think about the NovaSeq placements, I know we used to give more specificity around this when we first launched NovaSeq and the number of HiSeq customers that we still expect to take on NovaSeq. But we haven't provided that for some time. But the metric I will give you is for NovaSeq placements year to-date. We're still seeing roughly 40%-ish or so coming from new-to-Illumina customers. So really a great sign around the democratization of sequencing that NovaSeq has done. We're seeing about an additional 40% or so that's coming from NovaSeq capacity upgrades. So existing, obviously customers that are just upgrading or taking on more capacity. And then, roughly 20% or so from those HiSeq customers that are continuing to transition to NovaSeq. So that's still going on. We're going to continue to see that. The V 1.5 upgrade that we talked about will also help catalyze that as well, will drive that as well. So still very encouraging and good room to offset."

As expected, the second quarter was tough in the context of our original 2020 plan. But nonetheless, a quarter of strong execution in the current environment that further strengthens our foundation for future expansion. I've been proud to see how our employees have pivoted and flex to support customers, how we have stepped up what was already an aggressive innovation engine and how we have supported each other in our communities through this pandemic. As we navigate the near-term disruption, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity for Illumina and for sequencing, which if anything is larger today than it was 6 months ago. To summarize our second quarter experience and outlook. Our second quarter revenue of $633 million was down 25% from a year ago, as our customers around the world continue to be impacted by the pandemic. We are seeing indicators of gradual recovery and barring an unexpected development in the course of the pandemic, the second quarter should represent the revenue floor for the year. Further, we expect sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Second, despite lower patient visits, our clinical business remains more resilient than research, which continues to be more impacted by ongoing shelter-in-place restrictions. Third, infectious disease is emerging as an additional long-term focus area for genomics. Illumina has responded quickly with three workflows, including software tools and COVIDSeq, our diagnostic test for COVID-19 which went from concept to authorization in less than 60 days. Given the timing, these contributed very modestly to revenue in the second quarter and we're encouraged by the interest we are seeing so far in the third quarter. Finally and most importantly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for sequencing is expanding. While COVID-19 has had a negative short-term impact on our customers' ability to operate, this shared experience is broadening awareness and appreciation of the value of genomic insights. Studies is including GEL's 35000 patient study in the UK could ultimately accelerate the adoption of genomic tests into routine clinical use for infectious disease and surveillance. Looking to the second half of 2020 specifically, sequencing consumables, which make up most of our revenue remain correlated with shelter-in-place activities and recovery therefore, depends on how quickly our customers get back into their labs. That said, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business as we move into the second half of the year. Sequencing consumable run rates are improving and some of our clinical customers are at or above their run rate from the fourth quarter of last year. Sequencing system placements increased sequentially including higher NovaSeq shipments. Additionally, NextSeq 2000 shipments beat our second quarter expectations. Population genomics initiatives are continuing to move forward. All of us, for example, has received the necessary IDE from the FDA and we will start sequencing and genotyping later this quarter. And beyond research, COVID-19 related sequencing for both diagnosis and screening is at the earlier stage of adoption and could scale more meaningfully in the second half of the year. Sequencing continues to play a critical role in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the transmission dynamics of the pandemic, the development of effective treatment and vaccines, and the interactions between host and virus with respect to transmission and virulence. In addition, we're seeing growing interest in leveraging sequencing to help address the need for increased diagnostic and screening testing capacity. To contribute to testing capacity, Illumina urgently developed COVIDSeq, the first NGS-based diagnostic for COVID-19. We received emergency use authorization from the FDA on June 7 and shift to a few early access customers towards the end of the second quarter. [Indiscernible], for example, intends to launch towards the end of this quarter and scale through the end of 2020. COVIDSeq runs in our NovaSeq and in addition to a diagnostic yes or no, provides a full viral sequence for most positive samples. This information can be critical to understanding community transmission patterns in order to better control regional outbreaks. We continue to extend the utility of COVIDSeq with a series of amendments that will add saliva, improve automation and derisk supply chain. In the immediate term, we have submitted an amendment to the current authorization for our existing COVIDSeq test that simplifies the workflow, with an additional RNA extraction method to derisk the supply chain and extend the test beyond our NovaSeq by adding NextSeq. This will enable lower throughput labs to offer COVID-19 diagnostic testing locally, which could supplement current PCR test providers who are experiencing turnaround times of up to 10 business days. Looking forward, and with Illumina's COVIDSeq supply scaling up, we are in discussion with dozens of customers in more than 10 countries with a number of these actively evaluating COVIDSeq. For example, the Institute of Genomics and integrative Biology in New Delhi just completed their first clinical validation of COVIDSeq and reported sensitivity of more than 98% and an increase in diagnostic yield of between 8% and 10% compared to PCR. The team is interested in COVIDSeq as a means to increase available front-line testing, while also gaining access to the viral genome data that can be used to monitor transmission of the virus. In addition to COVIDSeq, we are pleased that Ginkgo and Helix were among the 7 recipients of funding from the NIH's rapid acceleration of diagnostics initiative. This underscores the potential for sequencing based diagnostic tests to scale and diversify testing beyond PCR, which we believe will be increasingly important as we head into the fall flu season. Moving to screening; it remains to be seen how widely screening programs are adopted. But it is clear that a number of programs will scale in the third quarter. Testing for America last week announced a partnership with the historically black colleges and universities, to develop return to campus initiatives for the academic institutions within the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the United Negro College Fund Family. Delaware State University, for example, started its pilot screening program a few weeks ago with plans to test up to 3,000 students and educators a week. Back to the quarter, and starting with regional results. All regions were impacted by prolonged closures or reduced operations at research labs. And also in some cases, by temporary reallocation of resources to PCR testing for COVID-19. China revenue was down $5 million sequentially, consistent with our expectation for a relatively modest decline. COVID-19 headwinds were driven by the research market with extended closures amongst some universities and research institutes that we expect to continue into the third quarter. Clinical, however, has shown some resilience through the pandemic with growth both sequentially and year-over-year driven by reproductive health. Oncology testing is still below pre-COVID-19 levels, but improving. EMEA revenue of $168 million was largely in line with our expectations and reflected significant sequential declines in both research and clinical sequencing consumables. Research headwinds were driven by lab closures, while some other customers' redirected resources to non-sequencing based COVID-19 diagnostic testing. As expected, the Americas region, saw the largest sequential dollar impact from COVID-19, and was down $142 million from last quarter to $335 million. Compared to April, more academic and government labs are resuming operations, but most are still operating well below pre-COVID-19 levels. Clinical continues to be more resilient with some customers reporting lower clinical samples associated with shelter-in-place restrictions. Finally, the Asia-Pacific region reported revenue of $51 million compared to $57 million in the second quarter of 2019 as research labs reduced activity. Moving to the customer view; we continue to track sequencing run rates as an indicator of general activity. But remind you that this is not directly correlated to revenue. It's clear that while customers navigate this pandemic, many are maintaining a lower level of sequencing consumable inventory than before. As a result, shipments and therefore revenue are lagging the recovery we're seeing in run rates. That said, in clinical, we shared that the run volume at the end of April was about 80% of the run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Clinical run rates for the second quarter of this year, average 84% of the Q4 '19 run rate. The trend is one of modest recovery, but with significant variation from week to week. Within clinical, reproductive health continues to be the most resilient, followed by Oncology. Moving to research, second quarter run rate improved from about 55% at the end of April to about 65% of the Q4 '19 run rate, but clearly remains significantly impacted by the pandemic. Weekly run rates among research customers are more variable than clinical. While commercial disruption has been unavoidable, the broader Illumina team continues to execute against our strategic priorities with new product releases and acquisitions that are intended to further enhance our customers' application portfolio and ease of use and expand our market opportunity. Early feedback on NextSeq 2000 has been very positive with customers reporting that the sequencers outperform expectations with the excellent data quality they have come to expect from Illumina. Despite the shift to the virtual world, our team has done a terrific job of installing new systems and getting customers up and running, which speaks to the strength of our support organization as well as the underlying engineering and product design. Additionally, customers are showing continued interest in the P3 flow cell, which remains on track for a fourth quarter launch. As noted earlier, we obtained the first emergency use authorization for a sequencing based COVID-19 diagnostic test in early June, highlighting our versatile R&D and regulatory capabilities. In early July, we launched the TruSight Software Suite for genetic disease that enables labs to accelerate time to potentially transformative genomic insights from weeks to hours. The TruSight Software Suite helps customers quickly sort through millions of variants to identify hard- to-find genomic conditions. We believe that this TruSight Software Suite could over time become part of a new standard of care for newborns suspected of a genetic condition. And there is already broad and growing reimbursement offered for genetic disease testing. As the opportunity for clinical sequencing grows, we continue to identify and address bottlenecks to adoption and this has resulted in innovation across the entire sequencing workflow. Most recently, we announced our new DNA PCR free prep which reduces library prep time by as much as 75%. This accelerates time to result and improves lab efficiencies, which are both even more important in the context of clinical samples. At the other end of the workflow, we continue to find ways to help our customers' store, manage, and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by our sequencers. With that in mind, we closed two technology acquisitions in June and July that combined with our existing software solutions improved the efficiency and scalability of processing and sharing data. BlueBee offers software solutions that enhance users ability to extract insights from genomic data stored in Illumina's analytics platform and Enancio brings proprietary lossless genomic data compression software that reduces storage footprint fivefold and will be integrated directly into the Dragon workflow. Outside of the sequencing workflow, but important nonetheless, we received positive feedback on our new sustainable reagent packaging which will divert almost 250,000 cubic feet of foam packaging from landfills each year. Finally, I'm pleased to announced some enhanced features and new pricing for our NovaSeq reagent kits. The new reagent kits deliver longer shelf life and extra cycles, extending our performance lead in the high throughput market. Additionally, the new kit offers more accessible pricing for any NovaSeq user, bringing the $600 genome into reach for all our customers. These changes represent Illumina's ongoing commitment to sequencing innovation to enable a deeper sequencing, adoption of more data intensive applications like whole-genome sequencing, single cell and liquid biopsy, and larger cohorts to increase the statistical power studies. With that, I'll hand it over to Sam to discuss the financials in more detail.\nSam Samad: Thanks, Francis. As discussed, second quarter revenue declined 25% year-over-year to $633 million as the pandemic impacted our research customers in particular. Total sequencing system revenue of $88 million was slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger than expected NextSeq 2000 shipments. Shipments for NovaSeq, NextSeq 2000, MiSeq, and MiniSeq all increased sequentially. We continue to see NextSeq 2000 adoption across a broad range of clinical and research applications including oncology testing, single cell, molecular pathology and infectious disease including COVID-19 Research. For the second quarter, most of the NextSeq 2000 shipments were legacy NextSeq conversion, and cumulatively to date, roughly a quarter of the new systems have been shipped the new-to-Illumina customers. Sequencing consumable revenue was $387 million with many customers still operating below pre-COVID levels. Of interest, clinical sequencing consumable revenue represented close to 50% of total sequencing consumables given the greater pandemic impact we're seeing among research customers. Sequencing service and other revenue was $91 million down sequentially due to lower licensing revenue and down year-over-year due to lower sequencing service revenue. Overall, sequencing revenue was $566 million and represented 89% of total revenue. Total array revenue was $67 million, down 39% from the same quarter last year and down 32% from the first quarter of 2020, in part due to our lower expectations of the DTC market and its normal seasonality in addition to COVID-19 related headwinds. Moving through the P&L, as always, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 68.6% was lower as expected on a both year-over-year and sequential basis. Due to lower revenue which generated less fixed cost leverage and higher freight costs associated with the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $334 million were down $5 million from the first quarter of 2020 and $26 million lower than the second quarter of 2019. This was lower than expected due to an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense to account for updated EPS projections. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% down from 33.6% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5% was up from last quarter and prior year due to a higher income mix in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate. For the second quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.62 per diluted share. On a per share basis, our GAAP results include $0.61 for two discrete tax expense items. The first of these relates to a valuation allowance established against the deferred tax asset for California R&D tax credits and the second reflects finalization of the Altera court case which determined share-based compensation must be included intercompany cost-sharing payments. This is partially offset by $0.38 on a per share basis from other income, which include $69 million in unrealized gains from equity investments. Additionally, in the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $240 million, capital expenditures were $38 million and free cash flow was $202 million. DSO of 55 days compared to 50 days last quarter in part due to less favorable revenue linearity and lower revenue. We repurchased $143 million of common stock. We therefore ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 148 million. We have $420 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. Additionally, our 2021 notes became convertible from July 1 through September 30, 2020. And as a reminder, the dilutive effects of the convertible notes have been included in our diluted average share count since the second quarter of 2018. We continue to believe that the uncertainties around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that has on our research customers in particular makes it challenging to provide quarterly or full year outlooks at this time. Directionally, we can share that we expect sequencing run volumes for our clinical customers to modestly improve from the 84% reported in the second quarter. For research and applied, we remain cautious and expect run volumes to improve modestly over the 65% reported in the second quarter. We expect sequencing instrument revenue to grow modestly on a sequential basis and we expect the re-revenue to be flat to slightly up. In terms of regional performance, we expect sequential growth in every region in the third quarter. While some regions are recovering more quickly than others, there will certainly be headwinds across all regions and when compared to the third quarter of 2019, we expect revenue in all regions to be lower with the exception of APJ which is expected to be about flat. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter of 2020 reflecting a gradual improvement in revenue, a sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in part driven by the adjustment to stock-based compensation in the second quarter and increased field service activity as labs reopen and an increase in non-GAAP operating expenses primarily driven by the adjustment to performance-based compensation in the second quarter. While we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially in the third quarter, we remain thoughtful and deliberate about where we invest. This means continuing to invest in R&D projects and utilizing our balance sheet to pursue growth opportunities. As a genomic technology leader, we believe we have an obligation to invest in innovation regardless of short-term revenue headwinds. But at the same time, we will balance this in other areas by pausing or delaying certain capital expenditures and limiting other discretionary spend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Sam. While the near-term disruption is challenging as we continue to navigate the pandemic, we remain as bullish as ever on the opportunity ahead for Illumina. The long-term opportunity for sequencing is expanding as the need for more infectious disease research and surveillance capabilities comes into focus. Innovation remains our North Star and we will continue to partner with our customers as well as innovate internally to ensure that sequencing-based applications are contributing to global efforts to combat this pandemic and whatever combination of research, diagnostics, screening and surveillance applications is the most impactful. Our competitive position is strong with the recent preliminary injunction helping protect our intellectual property here in the United States. And looking beyond the pandemic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to innovation and to investing appropriately to progress our technology pipeline and continue to deliver gold standard sequencing products to market. My thanks to our customers and to our employees who are demonstrating resilience and flexibility as we work through this pandemic together. With that, we can start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thank you. Francis, I know you don't have guidance out there, but I'm wondering if you can help us put some numbers around a couple of things on the COVID testing opportunity. You talked about that scaling more meaningfully in the back half of the year and the dozen customers and 10 countries. I'm just wondering if you can give us any framework about how you're thinking about the scale up there and the magnitude of that opportunity. Similarly on PopSeq -- at the beginning of the year, you talked about 280,000 genomes, obviously, there have been delays, but I'm just curious if you could catch us up on what percentage of those you think is done in the back half. And then lastly on China it was down 19%, which was a bit of a surprise given the recovery there. Can you may be talk to that and when that could return to growth? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Okay. So, let's go through each of those in order, Tycho. So first let's talk about COVID and how we expect that to scale in the second half. As we said in the prepared remarks, we saw very little COVID-related revenue in Q2, and we expect that to start to build into the back half of the year. In our base modeling -- we are modeling little COVID related revenue certainty in Q3, but there are a number of areas where our customers are looking to use sequencing that we expect to start to contribute revenue in Q3, and then ramping in Q4. Those areas are research, diagnostics, screening and surveillance. On the research side, there are a number of projects that got kicked off in Q2 that will start to scale in Q3 and into Q4. Examples include what's happening with genomic for example in the UK NHS GEL project where they're looking at 35,000 COVID patients and they are sequencing them to understand what are the drivers of the severity of the infection. There's also projects like CanCOGeN in Canada or GMI. On the Diagnostics side, we have a number of customers that are starting to scale up their diagnostic capabilities and so we have customers like [indiscernible]; for example Ginkgo, Helix, Garden to UCLA, they've all just started to scale up their diagnostic capabilities and we expect them to begin to scale in Q3 and then ramp up in Q4. We also have some customers that are looking at rolling out a screening-based offering as part of Back to School or Back to Work initiatives. One example includes what's happening at Delaware State University as I mentioned in the remarks, where they are working with one of our customers to screen about 3000 educators and students a week as part of getting people safely back into school. And so it remains to be seen how those initiatives scale up over Q3 and Q4, and it's quite a range of outcomes there as you can imagine getting it fairly big if it really gets adopted as a way to get people back safety to school. And then, there are a number of surveillance initiatives that are starting that are looking at helping track the epidemiology of the pandemic, and also looking to put together infrastructure that will last beyond this pandemic. So for example, there is work happening around the CDC's for example in terms of setting up a surveillance infrastructure. So those are the four buckets. There is research, there is diagnostics, screening and surveillance again very little in terms of revenue so far, but starting to ramp in Q3 and heading towards the end of the year. That was the first question. The second question, take it was around PopGen [ph] though talk about some of the big initiatives. In terms of all of us, we didn't see any sequencing revenue associated with in Q2 [ph], but there was progress there where they received the IDE from the FDA and are looking to start ramping up in Q3, and then more meaningfully ramp up in Q4. The UK NHS has really focused -- it has put on pause the project that it had, and is really now focused on the GEL-related project that I just talked about. The UK Biobank was sequencing in Q2, but significantly down in terms of run rate from where it was in Q1, and we expect that to continue to ramp over the course of the year. In terms of China, which I think was the last part of your question, it was down and what we're seeing in China is a real headwind in the research market, where although we are seeing China sort of work its way back to normal, there is still a phenomena where a lot of the academic labs are either closed or operating at lower capacity or being repurposed for COVID-related testing. And so the research market in China continues to be down. Having said that, we're seeing more resilience in China from the clinical market, and so we saw both, strength in the NIPT side of the business and in oncology, relative to the research market.\nSam Samad: Yes. And I would just add Tycho, on the clinical side in China as well, we're seeing growth actually sequentially and year-over-year. We saw that in Q2. So definitely resilience on the clinical side of the market in China, but research heavily impacted by the closures. The Beijing resurgence as well in the closures associated with that didn't help either in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for the time here. Two things I wanted to touch on. One is academic and two is sort of lead indicators, I guess I'd call it. In academic, I think we all have a pretty good understanding as to why it's a challenging environment, right? It has nothing to do with Illumina; it's just the way the world is right now. But what I wonder is, how do you think about, to what extent this is demand destruction versus demand deferral. I mean I'll elaborate on that a little bit. So, the funding in a lot of cases, it's there, but it's hard for people to get into the lab, does that mean that these projects are simply being deferred into some point out in the future. And to what extent are you concerned about the funding itself, given the challenges that universities are facing though I don't know that their -- the entirety of your academic funding set, if you will. And then, the second thing I want to talk about or ask about is Francis, early on in your prepared remarks you made a comment that -- suggested that at some point out in the future as a function of everything that's going on right now, you think the TAM is larger. So I wonder if you could just elaborate on that and I'm sure you've already touched on a lot of the points but how do you track that. What is it you're seeing day to day or is it mostly intuition are the lead indicators, how do you track this perspective that the TAM is actually larger, are their project metrics are quoting activity that you're looking at that give you a view as to what is likely to emerge in terms of sequencing activity, some number of weeks or months or quarters out into the future that you would be willing to talk to us about a little bit. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure, Steve. Thank you for the question. So there are two parts to it. The first part is around what do we -- what do we expect will happen in the academic markets around research dollars and whether we expect the projects to be deferred or canceled and how are we thinking about it. The feedback we're getting from our customers Steve, is that the projects are being deferred that they aren't being canceled, there being deferred, because either people are working at home as part of shelter-in-place initiatives and are unable to do the research that they need to do right now, or they are in the lab, but they're being [indiscernible] to non-sequencing COVID related work. But they're being told in, they're telling us though it is their intend to get back to those research projects and even in cases where there is a deadline associated with the funding for those projects, in many cases the deadlines are being pushed out to allow them to come back and pick up on the work. And so the clear feedback we're getting from our customers is that those projects are on pause and they expect to pick them back up. In addition, what we are hearing from our customers in the research community is that there is additional funding coming into the mix as a result of the pandemic. And so what they are seeing is money being allocated to genomics research associated with the pandemic whether it's to do with the host response for example or understand why some people are impacted more severely by the disease or a whole host of other things that's driving more dollars into the research market, that is. And so they are thinking about how to plan those projects right now. In addition, they are telling us that the early signals around NIH budgets for example in the US are very positive that the early proposals are around an increase of about $5.5 billion to the NIH budget on a base of about $47 billion; so pretty substantial increase as the first proposal. And that includes things like COVID related work, but it also proposes an increase into the funding of NHGRI, which is directly obviously related to genomics initiatives. And so, the academic research the signals about the comeback in academic research seem very positive to us right now. That's part of the reason why we introduced the $600 dollar genome because we want to people as they are thinking about the projects that they will take on and they come back in to be able to cope them appropriately and go broader with their emission because now they can plan larger projects with deeper sequencing or larger cohorts. And so there is definitely a lot of thinking about what they do when they come back. So that was the first part of your question. Second part of your question was around, okay, how does this impact the addressable market for Illumina. What's been the impact of the pandemic? And it's becoming clear to us that the overall TAM for Illumina has expanded over the last few months that if you had talked to us in even January or certainly by December or before, we really would have talked to you much more about the opportunity on the clinical opportunity in oncology and reproductive health, but not a lot about infectious disease. And clearly that's really changed over the last few months. What's becoming very clear is that there is a role for genomics in a number of areas in infectious disease. There is an existing role for genomics that scaling up in research, so there was always some genomics-related research in infectious disease that's really starting to scale up as we look to the coming months and quarters around some of the things I talked about -- like understanding the virus, understanding the interaction of the virus and the host. There is also a real need for genomic testing in diagnostics. And that's fairly new right. If we talked a few months ago, we would have said really that the infectious disease diagnostics market is really a PCR market primarily and that's changing as we look forward. There's going to be sequencing-based diagnostic capability that comes to market because of customers of ours like the Ginkgo or Helix [ph] and that's going to be an important part of the diagnostic testing market going forward and that's new and that's real. We're also seeing customers explore a much larger opportunity about screening and we're early in that, and you've heard about what's happening in Delaware State University. But that represents an entirely new opportunity around thinking about how you create safe environments in schools and work and that's a new part of the market that's becoming accessible to genomics. And then finally, there is a surveillance opportunity and this is something that I think it is durable because it's becoming very clear that we need a global pathogen surveillance network that's genomics based, that we need a much better early warning system to understand if there is a viral outbreak happening and that could be for things like the Coronavirus today, but looking forward, it's needed for things like antimicrobial resistance, for bio terrorist attacks for example, and so there is a need for an early warning system. There is a need for a network system that understands the transmission and virulence of the pathogen as it makes its way through our population. It's able to track the epidemiology of it and so that's also new, right. And so that's starting to be put into place and that's something that we will need from now on. So that's a whole new part of the market that's being introduced to genomics.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon. I want to start with the question on COVID and then ask a higher-level question on the capital equipment outlook. So starting on COVID. Yes, while there's little to debate that your efforts to help develop COVID solutions broadly should be commended and widely appreciated. I think it's fair to say there is ton of debate in both the clinical as well as the investor community about how big a role Illumina next generation sequencing approaches such as SwabSeq can play as a true clinical testing solution given the associated complexity and logistical challenges. We've all read about exciting initiatives such as those perceived by Ginkgo, but we've also read about places like the Broad Institute, which have a ton of sequencer setting there are really sophisticated maybe the most sophisticated in the world and yet while they're doing the most COVID testing volume in Massachusetts, we have no plans to use Illumina NGS for clinical sequencing. With that in mind, how many labs, do you think are going to try to do what Ginkgo is doing and for market sizing purposes, is it fair to conclude that the revenue per test opportunity for that approach is likely somewhere between $1 to $3 per test. The second thing I want to talk about capital. It's great to hear that clinical volumes are picking up and that folks are getting back in the lab and obviously those are good signs when it comes to the outlook for consumable demand, but instruments -- year-over-year you did better than I think a lot of us expected in the quarter, but as you look ahead, what do you think it's going to happen, like how are you thinking about the second half. Are you thinking that labs, even if they get back and pick up activity are going to tend to hold back a little while and capital spending when possible, just given the uncertainty of the environment? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Doug. So that's work through the parts of the question. So the first part of the question was around the real role of NGS in COVID testing and how, what kind of role will NGS play given that the majority of testing is being done on PCR and has been. So start there and then I'll talk about capital equipment. In terms of COVID, again if I look at [indiscernible], its research, its diagnostics, its screening and surveillance. Research no question -- there are research projects that are coming online that are uniquely suited to NGS compared to PCR. So all the projects that I talked about really, they are new, they are incremental and they need NGS. And so whether it's GMI in Ireland or any one of the projects that I talked about, that will be on NGS and those will ramp over the course of the year. In diagnostics, there's no question that the first wave of testing was already done on PCR. So, as the world needed to scale really quickly up its testing, it absolutely made sense for all of that scale up in the first wave to happen on PCR. The reason NGS is being pulled in now, there are a few reasons for it. One is, there are areas where -- we're running into capacity constraints right? And so when we talk to labs in certainly you will read that -- even here in the US, the turnaround times associated with the testing in the US right now can be 10 plus days and when you ask the labs why that is, they will tell you there is supply chain constraints that all the PCR testing services are competing for some of the same elements in the supply chain. And so labs are talking to us about meeting and are -- testing modality that doesn't compete for the same supply chain resources. And so that's where NGS comes in and that's why they expect a pretty significant need for testing. We were talking to one lab and they said look on a given day they will turn down 20,000 people for tests just because there is no capacity; so there is clearly need for a sizable system that doesn't compete of the same supply chain. So that's one reason we're being pulled into diagnostic testing. Another reason we're getting pulled into diagnostic testing is in some cases, people want more information. They don't just want the diagnostic yes or no, they do want a few things. One, they want to do a confirmatory for example, if somebody is positive on PCR in some cases, they want to do a confirmatory testing, they want to get more information in the viral genome for [indiscernible] information to get transmission data, so they can help inform policy decisions. And then in some cases they run a certain percentage of the negatives just to make sure that there isn't false negative problem happening. And so for that reason too they're looking to scale up their NGS capacity. So, those are some of the reasons we're being pulled into diagnostic testing and you asked about SwabSeq versus COVIDSeq and frankly, obviously we support them all. SwabSeq has been developed to provide a quick diagnostic yes or no answer right. And so it's a cheaper test and it does give you that yes-no answer and there are various flavors of SwabSeq that are being implemented by different customers of ours. You asked about the economics, you can think about depending on the flavor, it's sort of in the low to mid-single digits per test that comes to Illumina. If the customer is using COVIDSeq, you should think about it as a $20 test for example that comes to Illumina. And so, that is sort of the drivers of why NGS is being pulled into the diagnostics section. Now to help with that obviously, we developed COVIDSeq and sort of launched it at the end of Q2. And we've just filed for the EUA amendment to make the workflow simpler and to enable COVIDSeq to be run on NextSeq, which allows the smaller labs now to do the COVID testing. The next question you had -- the other two areas we're being pulled into COVID. So we talked about, research, we talked about diagnostics, we're being pulled into screening and again the idea here is to screen a healthy population, very large scale and so some of our customers like we talked about on the call are looking to use NGS for that high scale testing. It's early, there are some exciting pilots happening and we're watching to see how they play out. And then for surveillance, that's something you can really only do on NGS. It's not something you can do on PCR. Because what you want to do with surveillance is identify a pathogen outbreak as it happens, and so for that, you actually do need to get the sequence of the pathogen. And then similarly on surveillance, you want to track the transmission of the pathogen, and for that, you again need the genome of the virus more than you can get from a PCR test. And so surveillance is the real need that is uniquely suited for NGS. In terms of capital equipment; I'm going to turn it over to Sam.\nSam Samad: Yes. So if I can jump in real quick, Doug, on capital, I mean first of all, really encouraged by the results and the performance that we saw in NextSeq 2000 in Q2. So, it came in better than expected and really -- the feedback that we're hearing from customers is great. What we're also hearing from customers is absolutely no outright cancellations of capital equipment or you know basically no need for capacity. They are delaying certain purchases and that's to be expected given the uncertainty, I mean they have been facing some pretty significant closures and we saw that also on consumables where they drew down inventories in Q2. So we're seeing delays, but we're not seeing cancellations. They are still interested in terms of our expectations for the second half. We're expecting definitely a sequential increase in terms of the revenue that we expect from instruments and obviously the placements, as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Brennan from UBS.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Quite a couple, which I'll wrap into one. First one would be just on the clinical market, I know the improvement that you're expecting in Q2 is fairly modest, I mean I believe when you look at a lot of data being reported out of hospital, the improvement has been sharper through the quarter and the outlook I think is better. So I'm just wondering why you think you're not seeing a faster improvement for clinical NGS number one. Number two, just on pricing, do you expect, could you may be elaborate a bit on this to just really open up maybe the lower end of the market you offering $600 price down to the smaller labs and do you think that could galvanize maybe NovaSeq upgrade cycle as things get a little better with funding. And then, kind of number three, back to COVID; I'm just wondering on screening. I would think kind of the time is now in terms of as schools are looking to open up in the next couple of weeks. So, the fact that you're pointing maybe to 4Q is when this could kind of become more real for you, what is it that kind of is taking more time to get to this point for screening for you guys. And maybe could you elaborate a little bit on your funnel. I know Francis, you talked about Delaware. You said there's a lot of interest, but any color in terms of the screening opportunity and what you're seeing from customers. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. Thank you, Dan. So let's start with the clinical market. Sort of the dynamics there and why not faster. And really the clinical market is story of two markets, right? So if you look at what's happening in NIPT, NIPT has actually been fairly resilient. So if we look at, for example, in the Americas, we actually saw quarter-on-quarter growth in the NIPT market. So from Q1 to Q2, even though overall revenues for went down you did see growth in NIPT. So on one part of the clinical market, that's been fairly resilient to the NIPT part and that's fairly consistent. If you look at oncology, what's happening is, even though the oncology segment is more resilient than the research market, it is less resilient in NIPT and what's happening, and this is a dynamic that's playing out more broadly is that people aren't going in to get screened for cancer and fewer people are being diagnosed with cancer. It's not that they're not getting cancer just as much as they were before, it's just they aren't going in. And that's a human tragedy and it's showing up for us to where the oncology market is slowed down. Now, the cancer isn't going away and so at some point, we do expect people will go into get screened and will want to get tested so they can get matched for the appropriate therapy. So in the oncology market, there is likely to be some catch-up that needs to happen now. Unfortunately it won't help everybody, but there will be some catch-up that needs to happen. So that's the dynamics playing out in the clinical market. On the NIPT side some more resilience and oncology some resilience, but certainly not as much as on the NIPT side. In terms of the new NovaSeq pricing, the $600 dollar genome. The intent is with this release to make the $600 genome more accessible to our Illumina customers with this kit. What we think that does is it allows our customers to plan for larger projects that they think about writing grants and it's primarily targeted in the research market to whether it's single cell applications or deeper sequencing or larger cohorts, we wanted them to be aware of the price point as they are planning the projects when they come back into the labs. I think this will be an incremental positive in terms of the economics for the maybe some smaller core labs that haven't yet upgraded from their HiSeqs to NovaSeq. I think this makes the economics even more compelling. And so I think it will be an incremental positive in terms of driving that upgrade cycle. In terms of screening, unfortunately the screening need isn't going to go away in the next couple of weeks as people go to school. I was talking to an individual who runs the public health [ph] an American, and he and I sort of agree that we will meet this for at least a year, maybe somewhere between a year to two years. Because the reality is, even in an optimistic scenario, we're talking about a vaccine towards the end of this year becoming available and then between being available and being broadly deployed, there's going to be some time. And so in that time, there's going to be a real need to make sure that we have safe schools and safe work environment and that's where the need for screening is. So I think that need for screening is going to be playing out even going into sort of the middle of next year. Now, we've talked about one case being rolled out. We have a number of customers that are working on their screening initiatives and we'll leave it up to them to be public about what they're doing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Puneet Souda from SV8 Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi, Francis. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So I know this has been covered a little bit, but I just want to get to a core question here. I mean, traditionally, we have seen Illumina grow via the elasticity of demand, and that's what's driven you into multiple markets, we have seen expansion of multiple markets with that elasticity of demand. You were in fact the first ones to blend into some of the markets whole-genome sequencing being one of them and drove that market expansion. So I'm just starting to understand as you look at the next couple of years, do you see COVID research, COVID testing, and COVID surveillance and surveillance I completely agree that you absolutely need sequencing to chase some of these, so to speak, but do you think that these markets can truly drive that elasticity of demand for Illumina and that to a $20 per test. I mean, you obviously see TCR antigen other solutions point of care reaching these markets over the next year or so. So I'm just trying to get your view about how do you see elasticity of demand playing out here for Illumina. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thank you, Puneet. So. I think that different parts of the COVID market are -- need different price points and sort of what we want to do is make sure that we have the right offering at the right price point to activate the different parts of the market. So let me be more specific. If we look at the diagnostic part of the market, there you do need price points were labs are able to offer a test at $75 to $100, which is where reimbursement is and have a viable business. And so there something like COVIDSeq where the cost to them Illumina reagents is $20 or SwabSeq where it is in the single-digit dollars is exactly the right fit. And so that's the price point that unlocks -- that opens up that market for NGS. Now that market was never an NGS market. So this is all incremental to NGS. That was a PCR market. And so all of this is new dollars now that are available to NGS and to open up that market, you need a test at the $75 to $100 price point. And so to Illumina, that's either sort of low to mid-single digits or $20 a test, but that's a large test. Similar with screening, you need that same price point and you may even with pulling, be able to get to lower price points in that market and that's the price point that you need to activate those -- markets. Screening could be a very large market and it needs that kind of price point. Now, research and surveillance can sustain a higher price point, and so there, the $600 genome I think is the right sort of price point where if you're doing cohorts in the not measured in the millions, but measured in the thousands of 10s of thousands there $600 price point makes sense and sort of activates that market and so that's how we're thinking about it for the research market. Surveillance, it could be even a little bit higher because you're not talking about again millions of samples. And so, that's how we are thinking about the different markets and having different offerings with different price points to activate those markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon. So, a question on your comments about inventories being drawn down in the third quarter I guess or are in the second quarter, I guess. Where are they? And do you expect additional drawdowns in the third quarter or it could be some potential for some catch-up spending has come back? And I just want to go back on the -- sort of the academic and government market. I mean, we've had some conversations with people talking about pressures on philanthropy and endowments, and we've seen a number of organizations, just the ACS [ph], these are the ones cutting back on their spending. I know that's a big chunk of money that goes into supporting some of the sequencing centers and biomedical research centers. So, I'm just sort of wondering what you're hearing about potential personnel cutbacks and things in the academic markets. And this sort of goes into another question about, are you expecting any sort of pick up or budget flush in the fourth quarter. Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yes. So let me talk about inventories Derik, and thank you for the question and I'll hand over to Francis to talk about the academic dynamics that you referred to. With regards to inventories I mean, first of all, Q2 really played out as expected for us in a number of ways, I would say on the instrument side was favorable driven by NextSeq 2000. On the sequencing consumable side really where I would say we had lower than expected performance was on the research side and driven by what we think is inventory. What we believe is inventory drawdown in that market. And as we talk to our customers. I mean, obviously, driven by a couple of things, first of all the uncertainty, the fact that there is still closures the fact that there is still uncertainty as they look forward, the fact that also supply chains have become less uncertain so they have more visibility to the fact that supply chains are not disrupted so they can actually get inventories when they need them. They don't need to stock up. And so, when you look at the activity levels that we saw in Q2 it was really where we were expecting activity levels to be, but there was definitely a gap on the research side driven by research customers drawing down inventories. Your question is around what do we -- what are we seeing in terms of number of months of inventory with customers and what do we expect the dynamic -- how we expect the dynamics to play out over the next few quarters, that's hard to project, Derik in terms of whether we see starting back up, whether we see different dynamic in Q3 or Q4. Really, we don't have that visibility, what we are expecting is that activity levels will be a proxy to how we see sequencing consumables sequentially grow in the next few quarters. Then as we said on the prepared remarks, we are expecting activity levels to improve modestly for both clinical and research in Q3. But in terms of predicting inventory and predicting customer behavior in terms of how they're going to stock or destock, that's really difficult to answer at this stage, it's easier to just explain the Q2 dynamic as we did.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. And then in terms of academic and sort of government funding, what we are seeing is in some cases, researchers are getting more time to spend academic funding. So that could certainty sort of prolong a little bit how long the project takes as people are sheltered in place and they have longer to actually use the money. So we definitely are seeing that. We are seeing though more money come into genomics related COVID research not less and that's coming from some of the usual sources. So for example, I talked about the proposal to increase NIH funding next year by $5.5 million, including an increase of just over $650 million to NHGRI sets the proposal-- for NCRI. That's the proposal. But we're also seeing money come into COVID related research, surveillance from -- for example philanthropies. When we did the donation to the 10 countries in Africa for the African CDC, we were working with one of the largest philanthropies here in the US as well as one out of Asia to try and help deploy this global surveillance network. We are also seeing people who aren't usually funders of genomics work. So, for example sort of interesting cooperation between the expansion of the relationship between Microsoft and Adaptive for example around understanding the immune response to COVID. And so overall, we are still seeing interest in government funding, academic funding, and philanthropy funding associated with that COVID genomic research.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Just had a couple of additional follow-ups. I think first on the NGS consumables. How long -- I'm not sure what your level of visibility is here, but how long do you think it will take for research labs to get back to 100%. We've heard from some customers they think they can catch up by year-end from some of the closures that took place. Do you think that's realistic or not? Then just a follow-up on the clinical side as you roll out COVIDSeq from the NextSeq box. Can you give us an update on what the turnaround time will look like for testing and just how that could fit into the needs for COVID-19? Thanks.\nSam Samad: Maybe I'll talk very quickly about the sort of research ramp that you talked about Jack and thank you for the question. Francis can talk about COVIDSeq and the NextSeq turnaround. Again, this is all assumption based at this stage and it all depends on many factors around what we see with regards to the virus and the potential shelter in place restrictions and as we saw in Q2, we were going in the right direction and then things went in the wrong direction I'm preferring to the US here in terms of the response to the virus. But in terms of our expectations Jack, is that again as we mentioned earlier, is to see an improvement We were at 65% average in terms of run rates in Q2. That's a proxy, that's essentially activity levels on the sequencers that are connected to our proactive network and the base space and we expect that to improve in Q3 and to improve also sequentially modestly albeit in Q4. To get back to 100% I can't answer that. That really is not something that we have visibility to at this stage. But I think the way you should be thinking about it is gradual modest improvement in terms of activity levels as we go forward, and that applies to clinical as well, but that's in response to your question on Research.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. And then, Jack, in terms of your question on the turnaround time in NextSeq, obviously it depends on the workflow at our customers' sites that are implementing COVIDSeq and NextSeq in-house [ph]. The intent of course is to be able to have a test that allows the turnaround in that 24-hour time frame, but it really depends on the customer.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Jacquie Ross for closing remarks.\nJacquie Ross: Thanks, Mike. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website, as well as the dial-in instructions contained in today's press release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update following the close of the third fiscal quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. As expected, the second quarter was tough in the context of our original 2020 plan. But nonetheless, a quarter of strong execution in the current environment that further strengthens our foundation for future expansion. I've been proud to see how our employees have pivoted and flex to support customers, how we have stepped up what was already an aggressive innovation engine and how we have supported each other in our communities through this pandemic. As we navigate the near-term disruption, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity for Illumina and for sequencing, which if anything is larger today than it was 6 months ago. To summarize our second quarter experience and outlook. Our second quarter revenue of $633 million was down 25% from a year ago, as our customers around the world continue to be impacted by the pandemic. We are seeing indicators of gradual recovery and barring an unexpected development in the course of the pandemic, the second quarter should represent the revenue floor for the year. Further, we expect sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Second, despite lower patient visits, our clinical business remains more resilient than research, which continues to be more impacted by ongoing shelter-in-place restrictions. Third, infectious disease is emerging as an additional long-term focus area for genomics. Illumina has responded quickly with three workflows, including software tools and COVIDSeq, our diagnostic test for COVID-19 which went from concept to authorization in less than 60 days. Given the timing, these contributed very modestly to revenue in the second quarter and we're encouraged by the interest we are seeing so far in the third quarter. Finally and most importantly, we believe that the long-term opportunity for sequencing is expanding. While COVID-19 has had a negative short-term impact on our customers' ability to operate, this shared experience is broadening awareness and appreciation of the value of genomic insights. Studies is including GEL's 35000 patient study in the UK could ultimately accelerate the adoption of genomic tests into routine clinical use for infectious disease and surveillance. Looking to the second half of 2020 specifically, sequencing consumables, which make up most of our revenue remain correlated with shelter-in-place activities and recovery therefore, depends on how quickly our customers get back into their labs. That said, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business as we move into the second half of the year. Sequencing consumable run rates are improving and some of our clinical customers are at or above their run rate from the fourth quarter of last year. Sequencing system placements increased sequentially including higher NovaSeq shipments. Additionally, NextSeq 2000 shipments beat our second quarter expectations. Population genomics initiatives are continuing to move forward. All of us, for example, has received the necessary IDE from the FDA and we will start sequencing and genotyping later this quarter. And beyond research, COVID-19 related sequencing for both diagnosis and screening is at the earlier stage of adoption and could scale more meaningfully in the second half of the year. Sequencing continues to play a critical role in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the transmission dynamics of the pandemic, the development of effective treatment and vaccines, and the interactions between host and virus with respect to transmission and virulence. In addition, we're seeing growing interest in leveraging sequencing to help address the need for increased diagnostic and screening testing capacity. To contribute to testing capacity, Illumina urgently developed COVIDSeq, the first NGS-based diagnostic for COVID-19. We received emergency use authorization from the FDA on June 7 and shift to a few early access customers towards the end of the second quarter. [Indiscernible], for example, intends to launch towards the end of this quarter and scale through the end of 2020. COVIDSeq runs in our NovaSeq and in addition to a diagnostic yes or no, provides a full viral sequence for most positive samples. This information can be critical to understanding community transmission patterns in order to better control regional outbreaks. We continue to extend the utility of COVIDSeq with a series of amendments that will add saliva, improve automation and derisk supply chain. In the immediate term, we have submitted an amendment to the current authorization for our existing COVIDSeq test that simplifies the workflow, with an additional RNA extraction method to derisk the supply chain and extend the test beyond our NovaSeq by adding NextSeq. This will enable lower throughput labs to offer COVID-19 diagnostic testing locally, which could supplement current PCR test providers who are experiencing turnaround times of up to 10 business days. Looking forward, and with Illumina's COVIDSeq supply scaling up, we are in discussion with dozens of customers in more than 10 countries with a number of these actively evaluating COVIDSeq. For example, the Institute of Genomics and integrative Biology in New Delhi just completed their first clinical validation of COVIDSeq and reported sensitivity of more than 98% and an increase in diagnostic yield of between 8% and 10% compared to PCR. The team is interested in COVIDSeq as a means to increase available front-line testing, while also gaining access to the viral genome data that can be used to monitor transmission of the virus. In addition to COVIDSeq, we are pleased that Ginkgo and Helix were among the 7 recipients of funding from the NIH's rapid acceleration of diagnostics initiative. This underscores the potential for sequencing based diagnostic tests to scale and diversify testing beyond PCR, which we believe will be increasingly important as we head into the fall flu season. Moving to screening; it remains to be seen how widely screening programs are adopted. But it is clear that a number of programs will scale in the third quarter. Testing for America last week announced a partnership with the historically black colleges and universities, to develop return to campus initiatives for the academic institutions within the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the United Negro College Fund Family. Delaware State University, for example, started its pilot screening program a few weeks ago with plans to test up to 3,000 students and educators a week. Back to the quarter, and starting with regional results. All regions were impacted by prolonged closures or reduced operations at research labs. And also in some cases, by temporary reallocation of resources to PCR testing for COVID-19. China revenue was down $5 million sequentially, consistent with our expectation for a relatively modest decline. COVID-19 headwinds were driven by the research market with extended closures amongst some universities and research institutes that we expect to continue into the third quarter. Clinical, however, has shown some resilience through the pandemic with growth both sequentially and year-over-year driven by reproductive health. Oncology testing is still below pre-COVID-19 levels, but improving. EMEA revenue of $168 million was largely in line with our expectations and reflected significant sequential declines in both research and clinical sequencing consumables. Research headwinds were driven by lab closures, while some other customers' redirected resources to non-sequencing based COVID-19 diagnostic testing. As expected, the Americas region, saw the largest sequential dollar impact from COVID-19, and was down $142 million from last quarter to $335 million. Compared to April, more academic and government labs are resuming operations, but most are still operating well below pre-COVID-19 levels. Clinical continues to be more resilient with some customers reporting lower clinical samples associated with shelter-in-place restrictions. Finally, the Asia-Pacific region reported revenue of $51 million compared to $57 million in the second quarter of 2019 as research labs reduced activity. Moving to the customer view; we continue to track sequencing run rates as an indicator of general activity. But remind you that this is not directly correlated to revenue. It's clear that while customers navigate this pandemic, many are maintaining a lower level of sequencing consumable inventory than before. As a result, shipments and therefore revenue are lagging the recovery we're seeing in run rates. That said, in clinical, we shared that the run volume at the end of April was about 80% of the run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Clinical run rates for the second quarter of this year, average 84% of the Q4 '19 run rate. The trend is one of modest recovery, but with significant variation from week to week. Within clinical, reproductive health continues to be the most resilient, followed by Oncology. Moving to research, second quarter run rate improved from about 55% at the end of April to about 65% of the Q4 '19 run rate, but clearly remains significantly impacted by the pandemic. Weekly run rates among research customers are more variable than clinical. While commercial disruption has been unavoidable, the broader Illumina team continues to execute against our strategic priorities with new product releases and acquisitions that are intended to further enhance our customers' application portfolio and ease of use and expand our market opportunity. Early feedback on NextSeq 2000 has been very positive with customers reporting that the sequencers outperform expectations with the excellent data quality they have come to expect from Illumina. Despite the shift to the virtual world, our team has done a terrific job of installing new systems and getting customers up and running, which speaks to the strength of our support organization as well as the underlying engineering and product design. Additionally, customers are showing continued interest in the P3 flow cell, which remains on track for a fourth quarter launch. As noted earlier, we obtained the first emergency use authorization for a sequencing based COVID-19 diagnostic test in early June, highlighting our versatile R&D and regulatory capabilities. In early July, we launched the TruSight Software Suite for genetic disease that enables labs to accelerate time to potentially transformative genomic insights from weeks to hours. The TruSight Software Suite helps customers quickly sort through millions of variants to identify hard- to-find genomic conditions. We believe that this TruSight Software Suite could over time become part of a new standard of care for newborns suspected of a genetic condition. And there is already broad and growing reimbursement offered for genetic disease testing. As the opportunity for clinical sequencing grows, we continue to identify and address bottlenecks to adoption and this has resulted in innovation across the entire sequencing workflow. Most recently, we announced our new DNA PCR free prep which reduces library prep time by as much as 75%. This accelerates time to result and improves lab efficiencies, which are both even more important in the context of clinical samples. At the other end of the workflow, we continue to find ways to help our customers' store, manage, and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by our sequencers. With that in mind, we closed two technology acquisitions in June and July that combined with our existing software solutions improved the efficiency and scalability of processing and sharing data. BlueBee offers software solutions that enhance users ability to extract insights from genomic data stored in Illumina's analytics platform and Enancio brings proprietary lossless genomic data compression software that reduces storage footprint fivefold and will be integrated directly into the Dragon workflow. Outside of the sequencing workflow, but important nonetheless, we received positive feedback on our new sustainable reagent packaging which will divert almost 250,000 cubic feet of foam packaging from landfills each year. Finally, I'm pleased to announced some enhanced features and new pricing for our NovaSeq reagent kits. The new reagent kits deliver longer shelf life and extra cycles, extending our performance lead in the high throughput market. Additionally, the new kit offers more accessible pricing for any NovaSeq user, bringing the $600 genome into reach for all our customers. These changes represent Illumina's ongoing commitment to sequencing innovation to enable a deeper sequencing, adoption of more data intensive applications like whole-genome sequencing, single cell and liquid biopsy, and larger cohorts to increase the statistical power studies. With that, I'll hand it over to Sam to discuss the financials in more detail. Thank you, Sam. While the near-term disruption is challenging as we continue to navigate the pandemic, we remain as bullish as ever on the opportunity ahead for Illumina. The long-term opportunity for sequencing is expanding as the need for more infectious disease research and surveillance capabilities comes into focus. Innovation remains our North Star and we will continue to partner with our customers as well as innovate internally to ensure that sequencing-based applications are contributing to global efforts to combat this pandemic and whatever combination of research, diagnostics, screening and surveillance applications is the most impactful. Our competitive position is strong with the recent preliminary injunction helping protect our intellectual property here in the United States. And looking beyond the pandemic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to innovation and to investing appropriately to progress our technology pipeline and continue to deliver gold standard sequencing products to market. My thanks to our customers and to our employees who are demonstrating resilience and flexibility as we work through this pandemic together. With that, we can start the Q&A. Okay. So, let's go through each of those in order, Tycho. So first let's talk about COVID and how we expect that to scale in the second half. As we said in the prepared remarks, we saw very little COVID-related revenue in Q2, and we expect that to start to build into the back half of the year. In our base modeling -- we are modeling little COVID related revenue certainty in Q3, but there are a number of areas where our customers are looking to use sequencing that we expect to start to contribute revenue in Q3, and then ramping in Q4. Those areas are research, diagnostics, screening and surveillance. On the research side, there are a number of projects that got kicked off in Q2 that will start to scale in Q3 and into Q4. Examples include what's happening with genomic for example in the UK NHS GEL project where they're looking at 35,000 COVID patients and they are sequencing them to understand what are the drivers of the severity of the infection. There's also projects like CanCOGeN in Canada or GMI. On the Diagnostics side, we have a number of customers that are starting to scale up their diagnostic capabilities and so we have customers like [indiscernible]; for example Ginkgo, Helix, Garden to UCLA, they've all just started to scale up their diagnostic capabilities and we expect them to begin to scale in Q3 and then ramp up in Q4. We also have some customers that are looking at rolling out a screening-based offering as part of Back to School or Back to Work initiatives. One example includes what's happening at Delaware State University as I mentioned in the remarks, where they are working with one of our customers to screen about 3000 educators and students a week as part of getting people safely back into school. And so it remains to be seen how those initiatives scale up over Q3 and Q4, and it's quite a range of outcomes there as you can imagine getting it fairly big if it really gets adopted as a way to get people back safety to school. And then, there are a number of surveillance initiatives that are starting that are looking at helping track the epidemiology of the pandemic, and also looking to put together infrastructure that will last beyond this pandemic. So for example, there is work happening around the CDC's for example in terms of setting up a surveillance infrastructure. So those are the four buckets. There is research, there is diagnostics, screening and surveillance again very little in terms of revenue so far, but starting to ramp in Q3 and heading towards the end of the year. That was the first question. The second question, take it was around PopGen [ph] though talk about some of the big initiatives. In terms of all of us, we didn't see any sequencing revenue associated with in Q2 [ph], but there was progress there where they received the IDE from the FDA and are looking to start ramping up in Q3, and then more meaningfully ramp up in Q4. The UK NHS has really focused -- it has put on pause the project that it had, and is really now focused on the GEL-related project that I just talked about. The UK Biobank was sequencing in Q2, but significantly down in terms of run rate from where it was in Q1, and we expect that to continue to ramp over the course of the year. In terms of China, which I think was the last part of your question, it was down and what we're seeing in China is a real headwind in the research market, where although we are seeing China sort of work its way back to normal, there is still a phenomena where a lot of the academic labs are either closed or operating at lower capacity or being repurposed for COVID-related testing. And so the research market in China continues to be down. Having said that, we're seeing more resilience in China from the clinical market, and so we saw both, strength in the NIPT side of the business and in oncology, relative to the research market. Sure, Steve. Thank you for the question. So there are two parts to it. The first part is around what do we -- what do we expect will happen in the academic markets around research dollars and whether we expect the projects to be deferred or canceled and how are we thinking about it. The feedback we're getting from our customers Steve, is that the projects are being deferred that they aren't being canceled, there being deferred, because either people are working at home as part of shelter-in-place initiatives and are unable to do the research that they need to do right now, or they are in the lab, but they're being [indiscernible] to non-sequencing COVID related work. But they're being told in, they're telling us though it is their intend to get back to those research projects and even in cases where there is a deadline associated with the funding for those projects, in many cases the deadlines are being pushed out to allow them to come back and pick up on the work. And so the clear feedback we're getting from our customers is that those projects are on pause and they expect to pick them back up. In addition, what we are hearing from our customers in the research community is that there is additional funding coming into the mix as a result of the pandemic. And so what they are seeing is money being allocated to genomics research associated with the pandemic whether it's to do with the host response for example or understand why some people are impacted more severely by the disease or a whole host of other things that's driving more dollars into the research market, that is. And so they are thinking about how to plan those projects right now. In addition, they are telling us that the early signals around NIH budgets for example in the US are very positive that the early proposals are around an increase of about $5.5 billion to the NIH budget on a base of about $47 billion; so pretty substantial increase as the first proposal. And that includes things like COVID related work, but it also proposes an increase into the funding of NHGRI, which is directly obviously related to genomics initiatives. And so, the academic research the signals about the comeback in academic research seem very positive to us right now. That's part of the reason why we introduced the $600 dollar genome because we want to people as they are thinking about the projects that they will take on and they come back in to be able to cope them appropriately and go broader with their emission because now they can plan larger projects with deeper sequencing or larger cohorts. And so there is definitely a lot of thinking about what they do when they come back. So that was the first part of your question. Second part of your question was around, okay, how does this impact the addressable market for Illumina. What's been the impact of the pandemic? And it's becoming clear to us that the overall TAM for Illumina has expanded over the last few months that if you had talked to us in even January or certainly by December or before, we really would have talked to you much more about the opportunity on the clinical opportunity in oncology and reproductive health, but not a lot about infectious disease. And clearly that's really changed over the last few months. What's becoming very clear is that there is a role for genomics in a number of areas in infectious disease. There is an existing role for genomics that scaling up in research, so there was always some genomics-related research in infectious disease that's really starting to scale up as we look to the coming months and quarters around some of the things I talked about -- like understanding the virus, understanding the interaction of the virus and the host. There is also a real need for genomic testing in diagnostics. And that's fairly new right. If we talked a few months ago, we would have said really that the infectious disease diagnostics market is really a PCR market primarily and that's changing as we look forward. There's going to be sequencing-based diagnostic capability that comes to market because of customers of ours like the Ginkgo or Helix [ph] and that's going to be an important part of the diagnostic testing market going forward and that's new and that's real. We're also seeing customers explore a much larger opportunity about screening and we're early in that, and you've heard about what's happening in Delaware State University. But that represents an entirely new opportunity around thinking about how you create safe environments in schools and work and that's a new part of the market that's becoming accessible to genomics. And then finally, there is a surveillance opportunity and this is something that I think it is durable because it's becoming very clear that we need a global pathogen surveillance network that's genomics based, that we need a much better early warning system to understand if there is a viral outbreak happening and that could be for things like the Coronavirus today, but looking forward, it's needed for things like antimicrobial resistance, for bio terrorist attacks for example, and so there is a need for an early warning system. There is a need for a network system that understands the transmission and virulence of the pathogen as it makes its way through our population. It's able to track the epidemiology of it and so that's also new, right. And so that's starting to be put into place and that's something that we will need from now on. So that's a whole new part of the market that's being introduced to genomics. Thank you, Doug. So that's work through the parts of the question. So the first part of the question was around the real role of NGS in COVID testing and how, what kind of role will NGS play given that the majority of testing is being done on PCR and has been. So start there and then I'll talk about capital equipment. In terms of COVID, again if I look at [indiscernible], its research, its diagnostics, its screening and surveillance. Research no question -- there are research projects that are coming online that are uniquely suited to NGS compared to PCR. So all the projects that I talked about really, they are new, they are incremental and they need NGS. And so whether it's GMI in Ireland or any one of the projects that I talked about, that will be on NGS and those will ramp over the course of the year. In diagnostics, there's no question that the first wave of testing was already done on PCR. So, as the world needed to scale really quickly up its testing, it absolutely made sense for all of that scale up in the first wave to happen on PCR. The reason NGS is being pulled in now, there are a few reasons for it. One is, there are areas where -- we're running into capacity constraints right? And so when we talk to labs in certainly you will read that -- even here in the US, the turnaround times associated with the testing in the US right now can be 10 plus days and when you ask the labs why that is, they will tell you there is supply chain constraints that all the PCR testing services are competing for some of the same elements in the supply chain. And so labs are talking to us about meeting and are -- testing modality that doesn't compete for the same supply chain resources. And so that's where NGS comes in and that's why they expect a pretty significant need for testing. We were talking to one lab and they said look on a given day they will turn down 20,000 people for tests just because there is no capacity; so there is clearly need for a sizable system that doesn't compete of the same supply chain. So that's one reason we're being pulled into diagnostic testing. Another reason we're getting pulled into diagnostic testing is in some cases, people want more information. They don't just want the diagnostic yes or no, they do want a few things. One, they want to do a confirmatory for example, if somebody is positive on PCR in some cases, they want to do a confirmatory testing, they want to get more information in the viral genome for [indiscernible] information to get transmission data, so they can help inform policy decisions. And then in some cases they run a certain percentage of the negatives just to make sure that there isn't false negative problem happening. And so for that reason too they're looking to scale up their NGS capacity. So, those are some of the reasons we're being pulled into diagnostic testing and you asked about SwabSeq versus COVIDSeq and frankly, obviously we support them all. SwabSeq has been developed to provide a quick diagnostic yes or no answer right. And so it's a cheaper test and it does give you that yes-no answer and there are various flavors of SwabSeq that are being implemented by different customers of ours. You asked about the economics, you can think about depending on the flavor, it's sort of in the low to mid-single digits per test that comes to Illumina. If the customer is using COVIDSeq, you should think about it as a $20 test for example that comes to Illumina. And so, that is sort of the drivers of why NGS is being pulled into the diagnostics section. Now to help with that obviously, we developed COVIDSeq and sort of launched it at the end of Q2. And we've just filed for the EUA amendment to make the workflow simpler and to enable COVIDSeq to be run on NextSeq, which allows the smaller labs now to do the COVID testing. The next question you had -- the other two areas we're being pulled into COVID. So we talked about, research, we talked about diagnostics, we're being pulled into screening and again the idea here is to screen a healthy population, very large scale and so some of our customers like we talked about on the call are looking to use NGS for that high scale testing. It's early, there are some exciting pilots happening and we're watching to see how they play out. And then for surveillance, that's something you can really only do on NGS. It's not something you can do on PCR. Because what you want to do with surveillance is identify a pathogen outbreak as it happens, and so for that, you actually do need to get the sequence of the pathogen. And then similarly on surveillance, you want to track the transmission of the pathogen, and for that, you again need the genome of the virus more than you can get from a PCR test. And so surveillance is the real need that is uniquely suited for NGS. In terms of capital equipment; I'm going to turn it over to Sam. Sure. Thank you, Dan. So let's start with the clinical market. Sort of the dynamics there and why not faster. And really the clinical market is story of two markets, right? So if you look at what's happening in NIPT, NIPT has actually been fairly resilient. So if we look at, for example, in the Americas, we actually saw quarter-on-quarter growth in the NIPT market. So from Q1 to Q2, even though overall revenues for went down you did see growth in NIPT. So on one part of the clinical market, that's been fairly resilient to the NIPT part and that's fairly consistent. If you look at oncology, what's happening is, even though the oncology segment is more resilient than the research market, it is less resilient in NIPT and what's happening, and this is a dynamic that's playing out more broadly is that people aren't going in to get screened for cancer and fewer people are being diagnosed with cancer. It's not that they're not getting cancer just as much as they were before, it's just they aren't going in. And that's a human tragedy and it's showing up for us to where the oncology market is slowed down. Now, the cancer isn't going away and so at some point, we do expect people will go into get screened and will want to get tested so they can get matched for the appropriate therapy. So in the oncology market, there is likely to be some catch-up that needs to happen now. Unfortunately it won't help everybody, but there will be some catch-up that needs to happen. So that's the dynamics playing out in the clinical market. On the NIPT side some more resilience and oncology some resilience, but certainly not as much as on the NIPT side. In terms of the new NovaSeq pricing, the $600 dollar genome. The intent is with this release to make the $600 genome more accessible to our Illumina customers with this kit. What we think that does is it allows our customers to plan for larger projects that they think about writing grants and it's primarily targeted in the research market to whether it's single cell applications or deeper sequencing or larger cohorts, we wanted them to be aware of the price point as they are planning the projects when they come back into the labs. I think this will be an incremental positive in terms of the economics for the maybe some smaller core labs that haven't yet upgraded from their HiSeqs to NovaSeq. I think this makes the economics even more compelling. And so I think it will be an incremental positive in terms of driving that upgrade cycle. In terms of screening, unfortunately the screening need isn't going to go away in the next couple of weeks as people go to school. I was talking to an individual who runs the public health [ph] an American, and he and I sort of agree that we will meet this for at least a year, maybe somewhere between a year to two years. Because the reality is, even in an optimistic scenario, we're talking about a vaccine towards the end of this year becoming available and then between being available and being broadly deployed, there's going to be some time. And so in that time, there's going to be a real need to make sure that we have safe schools and safe work environment and that's where the need for screening is. So I think that need for screening is going to be playing out even going into sort of the middle of next year. Now, we've talked about one case being rolled out. We have a number of customers that are working on their screening initiatives and we'll leave it up to them to be public about what they're doing. Yes. Thank you, Puneet. So. I think that different parts of the COVID market are -- need different price points and sort of what we want to do is make sure that we have the right offering at the right price point to activate the different parts of the market. So let me be more specific. If we look at the diagnostic part of the market, there you do need price points were labs are able to offer a test at $75 to $100, which is where reimbursement is and have a viable business. And so there something like COVIDSeq where the cost to them Illumina reagents is $20 or SwabSeq where it is in the single-digit dollars is exactly the right fit. And so that's the price point that unlocks -- that opens up that market for NGS. Now that market was never an NGS market. So this is all incremental to NGS. That was a PCR market. And so all of this is new dollars now that are available to NGS and to open up that market, you need a test at the $75 to $100 price point. And so to Illumina, that's either sort of low to mid-single digits or $20 a test, but that's a large test. Similar with screening, you need that same price point and you may even with pulling, be able to get to lower price points in that market and that's the price point that you need to activate those -- markets. Screening could be a very large market and it needs that kind of price point. Now, research and surveillance can sustain a higher price point, and so there, the $600 genome I think is the right sort of price point where if you're doing cohorts in the not measured in the millions, but measured in the thousands of 10s of thousands there $600 price point makes sense and sort of activates that market and so that's how we're thinking about it for the research market. Surveillance, it could be even a little bit higher because you're not talking about again millions of samples. And so, that's how we are thinking about the different markets and having different offerings with different price points to activate those markets. Yes. And then in terms of academic and sort of government funding, what we are seeing is in some cases, researchers are getting more time to spend academic funding. So that could certainty sort of prolong a little bit how long the project takes as people are sheltered in place and they have longer to actually use the money. So we definitely are seeing that. We are seeing though more money come into genomics related COVID research not less and that's coming from some of the usual sources. So for example, I talked about the proposal to increase NIH funding next year by $5.5 million, including an increase of just over $650 million to NHGRI sets the proposal-- for NCRI. That's the proposal. But we're also seeing money come into COVID related research, surveillance from -- for example philanthropies. When we did the donation to the 10 countries in Africa for the African CDC, we were working with one of the largest philanthropies here in the US as well as one out of Asia to try and help deploy this global surveillance network. We are also seeing people who aren't usually funders of genomics work. So, for example sort of interesting cooperation between the expansion of the relationship between Microsoft and Adaptive for example around understanding the immune response to COVID. And so overall, we are still seeing interest in government funding, academic funding, and philanthropy funding associated with that COVID genomic research. Yes. And then, Jack, in terms of your question on the turnaround time in NextSeq, obviously it depends on the workflow at our customers' sites that are implementing COVIDSeq and NextSeq in-house [ph]. The intent of course is to be able to have a test that allows the turnaround in that 24-hour time frame, but it really depends on the customer."

            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As discussed, second quarter revenue declined 25% year-over-year to $633 million as the pandemic impacted our research customers in particular. Total sequencing system revenue of $88 million was slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger than expected NextSeq 2000 shipments. Shipments for NovaSeq, NextSeq 2000, MiSeq, and MiniSeq all increased sequentially. We continue to see NextSeq 2000 adoption across a broad range of clinical and research applications including oncology testing, single cell, molecular pathology and infectious disease including COVID-19 Research. For the second quarter, most of the NextSeq 2000 shipments were legacy NextSeq conversion, and cumulatively to date, roughly a quarter of the new systems have been shipped the new-to-Illumina customers. Sequencing consumable revenue was $387 million with many customers still operating below pre-COVID levels. Of interest, clinical sequencing consumable revenue represented close to 50% of total sequencing consumables given the greater pandemic impact we're seeing among research customers. Sequencing service and other revenue was $91 million down sequentially due to lower licensing revenue and down year-over-year due to lower sequencing service revenue. Overall, sequencing revenue was $566 million and represented 89% of total revenue. Total array revenue was $67 million, down 39% from the same quarter last year and down 32% from the first quarter of 2020, in part due to our lower expectations of the DTC market and its normal seasonality in addition to COVID-19 related headwinds. Moving through the P&L, as always, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 68.6% was lower as expected on a both year-over-year and sequential basis. Due to lower revenue which generated less fixed cost leverage and higher freight costs associated with the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $334 million were down $5 million from the first quarter of 2020 and $26 million lower than the second quarter of 2019. This was lower than expected due to an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense to account for updated EPS projections. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% down from 33.6% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5% was up from last quarter and prior year due to a higher income mix in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate. For the second quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.62 per diluted share. On a per share basis, our GAAP results include $0.61 for two discrete tax expense items. The first of these relates to a valuation allowance established against the deferred tax asset for California R&D tax credits and the second reflects finalization of the Altera court case which determined share-based compensation must be included intercompany cost-sharing payments. This is partially offset by $0.38 on a per share basis from other income, which include $69 million in unrealized gains from equity investments. Additionally, in the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $240 million, capital expenditures were $38 million and free cash flow was $202 million. DSO of 55 days compared to 50 days last quarter in part due to less favorable revenue linearity and lower revenue. We repurchased $143 million of common stock. We therefore ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 148 million. We have $420 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. Additionally, our 2021 notes became convertible from July 1 through September 30, 2020. And as a reminder, the dilutive effects of the convertible notes have been included in our diluted average share count since the second quarter of 2018. We continue to believe that the uncertainties around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that has on our research customers in particular makes it challenging to provide quarterly or full year outlooks at this time. Directionally, we can share that we expect sequencing run volumes for our clinical customers to modestly improve from the 84% reported in the second quarter. For research and applied, we remain cautious and expect run volumes to improve modestly over the 65% reported in the second quarter. We expect sequencing instrument revenue to grow modestly on a sequential basis and we expect the re-revenue to be flat to slightly up. In terms of regional performance, we expect sequential growth in every region in the third quarter. While some regions are recovering more quickly than others, there will certainly be headwinds across all regions and when compared to the third quarter of 2019, we expect revenue in all regions to be lower with the exception of APJ which is expected to be about flat. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter of 2020 reflecting a gradual improvement in revenue, a sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in part driven by the adjustment to stock-based compensation in the second quarter and increased field service activity as labs reopen and an increase in non-GAAP operating expenses primarily driven by the adjustment to performance-based compensation in the second quarter. While we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially in the third quarter, we remain thoughtful and deliberate about where we invest. This means continuing to invest in R&D projects and utilizing our balance sheet to pursue growth opportunities. As a genomic technology leader, we believe we have an obligation to invest in innovation regardless of short-term revenue headwinds. But at the same time, we will balance this in other areas by pausing or delaying certain capital expenditures and limiting other discretionary spend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Francis. Yes. And I would just add Tycho, on the clinical side in China as well, we're seeing growth actually sequentially and year-over-year. We saw that in Q2. So definitely resilience on the clinical side of the market in China, but research heavily impacted by the closures. The Beijing resurgence as well in the closures associated with that didn't help either in the quarter. Yes. So if I can jump in real quick, Doug, on capital, I mean first of all, really encouraged by the results and the performance that we saw in NextSeq 2000 in Q2. So, it came in better than expected and really -- the feedback that we're hearing from customers is great. What we're also hearing from customers is absolutely no outright cancellations of capital equipment or you know basically no need for capacity. They are delaying certain purchases and that's to be expected given the uncertainty, I mean they have been facing some pretty significant closures and we saw that also on consumables where they drew down inventories in Q2. So we're seeing delays, but we're not seeing cancellations. They are still interested in terms of our expectations for the second half. We're expecting definitely a sequential increase in terms of the revenue that we expect from instruments and obviously the placements, as well. Yes. So let me talk about inventories Derik, and thank you for the question and I'll hand over to Francis to talk about the academic dynamics that you referred to. With regards to inventories I mean, first of all, Q2 really played out as expected for us in a number of ways, I would say on the instrument side was favorable driven by NextSeq 2000. On the sequencing consumable side really where I would say we had lower than expected performance was on the research side and driven by what we think is inventory. What we believe is inventory drawdown in that market. And as we talk to our customers. I mean, obviously, driven by a couple of things, first of all the uncertainty, the fact that there is still closures the fact that there is still uncertainty as they look forward, the fact that also supply chains have become less uncertain so they have more visibility to the fact that supply chains are not disrupted so they can actually get inventories when they need them. They don't need to stock up. And so, when you look at the activity levels that we saw in Q2 it was really where we were expecting activity levels to be, but there was definitely a gap on the research side driven by research customers drawing down inventories. Your question is around what do we -- what are we seeing in terms of number of months of inventory with customers and what do we expect the dynamic -- how we expect the dynamics to play out over the next few quarters, that's hard to project, Derik in terms of whether we see starting back up, whether we see different dynamic in Q3 or Q4. Really, we don't have that visibility, what we are expecting is that activity levels will be a proxy to how we see sequencing consumables sequentially grow in the next few quarters. Then as we said on the prepared remarks, we are expecting activity levels to improve modestly for both clinical and research in Q3. But in terms of predicting inventory and predicting customer behavior in terms of how they're going to stock or destock, that's really difficult to answer at this stage, it's easier to just explain the Q2 dynamic as we did. Maybe I'll talk very quickly about the sort of research ramp that you talked about Jack and thank you for the question. Francis can talk about COVIDSeq and the NextSeq turnaround. Again, this is all assumption based at this stage and it all depends on many factors around what we see with regards to the virus and the potential shelter in place restrictions and as we saw in Q2, we were going in the right direction and then things went in the wrong direction I'm preferring to the US here in terms of the response to the virus. But in terms of our expectations Jack, is that again as we mentioned earlier, is to see an improvement We were at 65% average in terms of run rates in Q2. That's a proxy, that's essentially activity levels on the sequencers that are connected to our proactive network and the base space and we expect that to improve in Q3 and to improve also sequentially modestly albeit in Q4. To get back to 100% I can't answer that. That really is not something that we have visibility to at this stage. But I think the way you should be thinking about it is gradual modest improvement in terms of activity levels as we go forward, and that applies to clinical as well, but that's in response to your question on Research."

I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe as we collectively work our way through these challenging times. As a global citizen and a leader in genomics, Illumina is committed to doing everything we can to support efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, help patients and public health efforts, and accelerate economic recovery. In earlier stages of the outbreak, Illumina\u2019s technology was used by Dr. Fan Wu and the team at the Shanghai Public Health Center to sequence the first complete published viral genome of what was later named SARS-CoV-2. Since then, teams all over the world have been working with Illumina\u2019s technology to identify strains and monitor mutations in support of surveillance efforts, to understand therapeutic and host response and explore sequence-based diagnostic testing as well as population screening to support back to work programs. In terms of surveillance, Dr. Trevor Bedford at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Dr. Charles Chiu at UCSF are among those monitoring virus transmission and tracking mutations. And we have donated products to the Africa CDC to expand their NGS-based surveillance capabilities for infectious disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda in some cases bringing sequencing capability to the country for the first time. Susceptibility to COVID-19 is almost certainly in part genetic. And it\u2019s important to understand the interactions between viral and host genetics to potentially identify those individuals most at risk and support the development of therapies and vaccines. We are supporting multiple collaborations with partners, including the New York Genome Center, Stanford, Adaptive Biotechnology and Genomics England to better understand the evolution of the viral genome and potential genetic factors determining an immune response. Earlier this week, Genomics Medicine Ireland announced that it will sequence COVID-19 positive samples to identify risk-bearing and protective factors for COVID-19. In terms of testing, while the majority of testing will occur using PCR and serology-based tests, there are numerous groups looking to multiplex testing using NGS. For example, one of our partners, IDbyDNA, offers clinically validated, NGS-based testing. Additionally, multiple groups are publishing papers describing the performance of NGS assays with plans for clinical validation. Finally, some customers are working on ultra-high throughput NGS-based screening tests for return to work. While these efforts are early, our teams are working to help customers meet the testing challenges that have been highlighted as critical to enable our economies to sustainably recover without placing individuals at risk. As we support our customers\u2019 efforts, I am always impressed, but rarely surprised by the innovations delivered by the Illumina team. To support COVID-19 work, we have released a number of workflows and data analytics to help identify the virus and track its transmission, including a shotgun metagenomics application to enable researchers and academics to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 and other novel pathogens for epidemiology; the application also supports the unbiased detection of co-infections and the profiling of host response genes to study co-morbidities and human immune response; an enrichment workflow for Public Health Labs to enable highly accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 and viral sequence information to optimize containment strategies and identify co-infections of other respiratory viruses that may require different treatments; an amplicon workflow to support Public Health Labs studying SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology with co-infections at higher sample volumes; and a new software toolkit that makes it easier for researchers to detect and identify SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and contribute their findings to public databases. We have made this toolkit freely available to anyone who is using an Illumina sequencer. Illumina\u2019s mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome has never been more relevant. I would like to thank the global Illumina team for their dedication to keeping our employees safe, ensuring supply for those customers who are performing critical work, whether COVID-19 related or not \u2013 and doing everything we can to contribute to combating this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the many Illumina customers and partners who are working directly to fight COVID-19. We are inspired by your drive, creativity and commitment and will do whatever we can to maximize the impact of your efforts. With that, I will move to our quarterly update. Illumina reported first quarter revenue of $859 million compared to our guidance range of $850 million to $855 million. Clearly, there are a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so I will talk about our business in three ways, so that we can share many of the insights we have, by region, by customer, and by product. Starting with the regions, China was the first to be impacted by COVID-19 and was therefore the most impacted in the quarter. As the outbreak grew, our priority was to support customers as they scaled their capabilities for COVID-19 related work. This included the installation of iSeq and MiSeq systems starting in January at one of the CDCs in the hardest hit region and supporting other CDC locations and hospitals in the country. As China implemented measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, it became difficult for patients to maintain clinical appointments for oncology and NIPT testing. As a result, both sequencing systems and sequencing consumables were lower than expected in China in the first quarter and total China revenue was $84 million. We have started to see run volumes increase in China in March and April. It\u2019s not back to business as normal, but we are seeing both research and clinical customers returning to their labs in China and scaling up their operations. EMEA and AMR were resilient to COVID-19 through much of the first quarter and were tracking above our expectations in February. Momentum slowed quickly in mid-March as the wave of closure and shelter-in-place orders flooded across these regions in the closing weeks. Both EMEA and AMR still beat our expectations for the first quarter, but were clearly impacted by COVID-19. First, total system shipments were lower than expected in both AMR and EMEA. Systems tend to be back-end loaded in any given quarter and system purchases were not considered high priority for many customers at the end of the first quarter. Second, we saw some customers preemptively stocking up on sequencing consumables. Total EMEA revenue was $221 million and total AMR revenue was $477 million. Finally, APJ delivered revenue of $77 million, with solid sequencing consumable growth, including record shipments in Japan, despite COVID-19 related headwinds. In fact, this was a record quarter for APJ overall, with the highest total revenue ever reported for that region. We expect Q2 to be an extremely challenging quarter, with revenue declining sequentially in each region, albeit more modestly in China. On a positive note, Illumina\u2019s operations have stayed up and running globally, and so far we have been able to overcome any COVID-19 related challenges and deliver products to our customers in a consistent and timely manner. Moving to a customer view, it is clear that COVID-19 is impacting different customers in different ways, and we have some insights drawn from the volume of runs associated with our connected network of sequencing systems. While not all our systems are connected, we believe this is a useful reference that shows the general activity trend across our installed base. Runs are reported regardless of volume of sequencing output and are not directly correlated to revenue. First, both research and clinical runs were ramping well throughout the quarter, peaking during the week ending March 14th. Not surprisingly, the number of research and applied runs started to slow during the week beginning March 15th, especially among academic institutions. This reflects research labs scaling back in response to shelter-in-place requirements, for those not working directly on COVID-19. The decline was rapid in the second half of March, but then stabilized quite quickly, and has been roughly flat since the beginning of April. Overall, research volume is running at close to 55% of what it was in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving to clinical, run volume was impacted by COVID-19, but was somewhat more resilient than research. Clinical runs also reached their high point for the quarter during the week ending March 14th. In the week beginning March 15th, clinical run volumes started to decline, albeit more slowly than we saw in research. Unlike some of our research customers, many of our clinical customers are considered essential healthcare services and have remained open, although sample volume is being impacted as patients avoid healthcare facilities. While more modest, the clinical declines extended for four weeks, and we started to see stabilization in the week beginning April 12th. Clinical volume is currently running at just over 80% of what it was in the fourth quarter of last year. In summary, the shape of the curve has been a little different for research and clinical customers. Research run volume dropped faster, but also stabilized more quickly, and has been roughly flat for the last four weeks. The clinical run volume drop was more gentle but the duration was longer before stabilizing in the last two weeks. Both research and clinical run volume increased modestly on a sequential basis in the week beginning April 19, although it is clearly too early to call any kind of trend. Finally, moving to the revenue view, total sequencing system revenue of $79 million was down 25% from the same quarter of last year, and substantially below our expectations driven by COVID-19 disruption. Excluding the COVID-19 impact on sequencing systems, we would have comfortably exceeded our sequencing system revenue expectation for the quarter. However, system shipments were down across all families, with the exception of NextSeq 2000 in its first quarter of launch. First customer shipments of our NextSeq 2000 were delivered right on time on March 9. Orders for the system were in-line with our internal forecast for the first quarter, but shipments were lower than expected because of the COVID-19 disruption at the end of the quarter. Early adopters of the NextSeq 2000 included both existing and new Illumina customers in research and academic institutions across all four regions. Initial NextSeq 2000 applications included food safety, genetic disease, cancer, and COVID-19 research. We did not ship any new NextSeq 2000s to HiSeq conversion customers in the first quarter. The sales funnel so far is consistent with our expectation for very modest cannibalization of NovaSeq conversions among remaining HiSeq customers in the quarters ahead. Finally, almost half of the new NextSeq 2000s shipped were too new to Illumina system customers, ahead of our expectations. Sequencing consumable revenue of $553 million grew 15% from the same quarter last year and was stronger than expected. Less than half of the sequencing consumable beat was associated with COVID-19 related stocking among our clinical customers. NovaSeq pull-through per system was higher than the same quarter last year and comfortably within the previous guidance of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per NovaSeq per year. We do expect NovaSeq pull-through to step down meaningfully in the second quarter. Pull-through for both MiSeq and our NextSeq 500 and 550s was flat with last quarter, and MiniSeq was below its targeted pull through range. Sequencing service and other revenue was $128 million, up 13% due to higher licensing revenue compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, sequencing revenue of $760 million was slightly ahead of our expectation, and represented 88% of total revenue. Moving to arrays, total array revenue was $99 million, down 33% from the same quarter last year, and in-line with our expectations for the first quarter. Our array services business grew sequentially as we expected, given the normal seasonality associated with DTC, but declined year-over-year. Array consumables declined both sequentially and year- over-year, consistent with our expectations of the DTC market. In summary, our business was impacted negatively overall by over $20 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by sequencing instruments, but this was partially offset by a modest contribution from COVID-19 related stocking, and broader strength across sequencing consumables and sequencing service and other. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Sam to discuss the financials in more detail.\nSam Samad: Thanks, Francis. And thanks to you all for joining us today. I really hope you and your families are safe and healthy. As discussed, first quarter revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $859 million, slightly with sequencing consumables and sequencing services and other, offsetting softer than expected sequencing system revenue. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today\u2019s release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 73.0% was higher than our expectations, with lower sequencing system revenue and higher sequencing consumable and other revenue resulting in a more favorable mix in addition to increased fixed cost leverage as we increased safety stock volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $339 million were down $33 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, and down $24 million from the first quarter of 2019. This was lower than we expected due to delayed project spend, reduced labor- related expenses and less travel. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up from 31.0% last quarter, and better than expected. The non-GAAP tax rate of 16.1% was down from last quarter and lower than expected due to prior year return adjustments and discrete tax benefits related to the release of tax reserves. For the first quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $173 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $243 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Additionally in the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $281 million; First quarter capital expenditures were $40 million and free cash flow was $241 million. DSO of 50 days compared to 55 days last quarter due to more favorable revenue linearity. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This is down from $3.4 billion reported at the end of 2019, due to $187 million in share repurchases in the first quarter, and $132 million for the reverse termination fee and continuation advances paid to Pacific Biosciences. The expenses related to the PacBio payments are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 148 million. We have $563 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. Looking forward, we have withdrawn all our previous guidance due to the uncertainties around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. To be very clear, this includes our revenue and EPS guidance, in addition to any other forward-looking comments we have made on NovaSeq or other system portal, NextSeq 1000 and 2000 shipments and PopGen expectations for the year. One month in, we can see that the second quarter impact will be substantially greater than the impact we experienced in the first quarter and we are planning accordingly. As mentioned before, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in every region in the second quarter with the smallest dollar decline expected in China and the largest in AMR. While we have so far been able to produce and deliver to our customers with minimal delays in the first quarter, we note a higher risk of transportation delays associated with border closures and a drop in air freight capacity linked to fewer passenger flights. Again, these are not impacting our business today, but are risks as we look forward. Given the wide range of possible outcomes, we are not offering guidance on second quarter revenue at this time. Even though we are not providing second quarter guidance, we can share some qualitative comments about factors that will impact our P&L in the second quarter. For example, it is clear that substantially lower revenue will lower our gross margin, so you should expect a lower gross margin in the second quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. In terms of operating expense, we remain committed to investing strategically to ensure that we protect the strength of our business when we emerge on the other side of the COVID-19 disruption. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be roughly flat on a dollar basis compared to the second quarter of last year. Illumina is an innovation engine and while we have de-prioritized some work we will do everything we can to retain our most important product development timelines. That said we are managing expenses very carefully. In the near-term, there are savings associated with restricted discretionary expenses, including travel, marketing events and consulting and slower hiring associated with a lengthening hiring cycle. We are also reducing spend on contract and temporary labor in certain functions. Finally, we have delayed certain non-R&D projects and delayed or canceled certain capital expenditure projects. Compared to our original budget for the year, second quarter operating expenses have been reduced by more than $40 million. We are also preparing for additional cost savings opportunities if shelter-in-place orders remain prevalent into the third quarter. While we are all hoping for loosening of restrictions in the near future, we have planned for a range of scenarios that we can activate if needed. We will monitor the situation carefully throughout the rest of the second quarter to assess whether we need to take more aggressive actions more quickly. This includes a careful reassessment of our capital investment plans and gating programs in some cases. In the meantime, we continue to hire and on-board new team members virtually, but retain the flexibility to pause or limit hiring or slow other investments if the pandemic is prolonged. With that, I will hand the call back over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Sam. We are mindful of the balance between navigating the uncertain duration of this pandemic and ensuring that we don\u2019t do anything that slows our pipeline of innovation or otherwise inhibits our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We are hopeful that the biggest impact will be felt in the second quarter, but ensuring that we are well prepared if it extends into the second half of the year. As challenging as the current environment is, we don\u2019t see any change to the long-term trajectory of sequencing adoption and demand. Clinical testing has proved quite resilient even in these challenging times, highlighting the importance and medical value of genomic testing. While it\u2019s true that some labs have paused their research operations, it\u2019s also clear that a number of research labs are switching to COVID-19 related projects. Clearly, we have a lot of work to do to find our way out of this pandemic and then prepare for the next one. It\u2019s reassuring to see that governments around the world are committing resources to this important work. For example, the last two relief packages from the United States government has allocated over $1 billion to the CDC, with the specific goal of building out surveillance and other capabilities in the hope that we can be better prepared for the next time. We do not believe that there is a technological limitation to getting this done. And it\u2019s clear that sequencing will be at the heart of the solution. It is a challenging time to be running a business. But the Illumina community, including our employees, our suppliers, our partners and our customers has never been more united to a cause or more convinced of the importance of our shared work. We are leaving no stone unturned as we actively look for more and more ways to contribute to the effort. With that, we can start the Q&A.\nJacquie Ross: Do you have our first question at this time?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks. Thanks for taking the question and good luck managing through this period of time. So I just had a two-parter. It relates to \u2013 first part is on the academic end market for you. Can you just give us a sense of when academic researchers start to come back to their labs? Help us think through how quickly you think they can kind of ramp back up and related to that, we\u2019ve heard that it will be difficult to make up for lost time in the lab, vis-a-vis consumable usage but that instrument orders like we could see can still be fulfilled. So if you can just comment on that? And then the second part is related to COVID NGS testing. Obviously, there is a lot of interest in the PCR testing opportunity and you discussed some of the nascent interest or kind of impact from NGS testing? Could that turn out to be a real opportunity for Illumina, any color you can provide on that would be helpful? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Dan. So let me go through each of your questions. The first question was around the academic market. How quickly will that ramp-up when people get back to work and is there a possibility for them to catch up on the consumables or capital purchase? Let me start with that one. Let me start by acknowledging really some of the terrific work that some of our academic research customers have been doing over the last few months under some very challenging circumstances. I talked a little bit about the work that Professor Bedford was doing out at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, Charles Chiu at UCSF, really we\u2019ve seen our researchers really jump all in to help us combat the pandemic and understand the mutations in the virus, the transmission vectors and the host response. In terms of how quickly that business could ramp back up. Now that business is going to continue to be impacted as long as the shelter-in-place mandates remain in effect. But once those mandates get lifted, we expect that business to start to ramp fairly quickly. What\u2019s happening is that some of the work that they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t going away. And so we expect them to be able to pick up on projects when they get back into the office \u2013 into the labs. And we expect to see a number of things happen. One, in some cases and it is certainly true with the [indiscernible] for example at the UK Biobank where there will be an attempt to catch up on the time work, but there is an urgency to the work that they are doing. In other cases you will see some academic customers we expect be granted extensions to their current funding window. So they can finish the projects that we\u2019ve been working on. And frankly as we think through our research customers, it\u2019s hard to think of examples where the work they\u2019re doing goes away. Another dynamic is blood count that\u2019s becoming very clear that there is a need for research to be done on the COVID-19 pandemic itself to understand things like the evolution of the viral genome, really also understand the genetic factors that are \u2013 that create risk, that provide protective factors for individuals, understand the origins of the virus and there is work going on in single cell research to understand how a cell evolves when the virus enters the cell and so there is an emerging need for additional research to be done and we expect our academic customers and our commercial research customers to be involved with that through this quarter and certainly in the coming quarters as well. And so we expect to see that work ramp up as well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there is funding that\u2019s been allocated to the NIH, to the CDC in the UK, there is research to the COVID-19 genomics UK consortium that will fund that research. And then to your second question around the opportunity for NGS in COVID-19 testing, there are number of places where COVID \u2013 the NGS is being used in testing. One is there are customers of ours as I mentioned in the remarks that are using NGS based assays to do diagnostic testing. They\u2019re adding to the capacity in the market using NGS based assays. So that\u2019s one thing we\u2019re seeing. Secondly, we\u2019re seeing the need for NGS technologies to be used in surveillance capabilities. And that\u2019s true in CDC, starting with the CDC in China, but now it\u2019s true in CDCs around the world and we recently just shipped CDCs to a number of countries in Africa, as well. So there is another need for NGS to be used in surveillance capabilities. Another area that\u2019s emerging is the idea of using ultra high throughput screening testing to bring people back to work and so there are concepts being developed by customers of ours around using NGS to deliver that ultra high throughput screening capability to move healthy people back to work and in some cases to do regular testing to keep healthy people back at work. And so we\u2019re seeing that emerge as a possibility as well for NGS based testing. And then finally, there is a whole area around using NGS to do the research and whether that\u2019s to develop additional diagnostic tests or for therapies or to understand host responses, we we\u2019re seeing that emerge as another need for NGS as well.\nSam Samad: Dan, I\u2019ll offer up one data point, this is Sam. In the first quarter \u2013 first month, I should say of Q2, we\u2019ve also seen stronger than expected instrument shipments actually to academic institutions. So that\u2019s a testament to the resiliency of that part of the market, despite the fact that we\u2019re still in shelter-in-place more than disruption. So we are confident that once we get past this pandemic that this will rebound, both in terms of instruments and in terms of consumable utilization as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Thank you. Francis, as we think about the growth drivers that were laid out at the beginning of the year. Obviously PopSeq was one of them, clinical being another. I\u2019m just wondering on PopSeq if you can bring us up to speed on all of the NHS UK Biobank, how would you think about some of those initiatives may be restarting. There are obviously some of the most, let\u2019s kick off in the back half of the year anyway, but I\u2019m curious for the latest on those? And then on clinical, I appreciate the commentary that the clinical drop is more general and the duration is longer. We\u2019ve seen some numbers that cancer testing is down 25%, 30%. Just curious about how you think about the recovery on the clinical side. And then lastly on pandemic surveillance, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re doing anything differently organizationally or in terms of R&D dollars going forward, should we think about future pandemics. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. So, let\u2019s go through each of those questions. First, let\u2019s start with an update on PopGen. And it\u2019s clear that the shelter-in-place requirements have actually impacted the PopGen programs. And I\u2019ll talk about some of the major ones. As you might have heard from the NHS, we are waiting to hear revised dates to when they ramp-up. They haven\u2019t put out any new dates yet. So we\u2019re continuing to stay engaged with them and they\u2019re evaluating their plans around the ramp-up that was planned over the back half of this year. The UK Biobank and [indiscernible] announced in March that they were pausing they\u2019re sequencing and they said for a three month period. Now there is urgency around that work and so in that effort we expect that when they start sequencing again, they will ramp up very quickly, and they were running at about 10,000 genomes a month before they paused, so we expect them to be able to ramp that up pretty quickly. And they are the kind of customer that would invest to catch up in terms of the sequencing that was missed. Because there\u2019s value to the data they are getting from a therapy perspective and there is also a finite window of exclusivity with that data, and so there is an urgency around getting back up to speed and catching up. In terms of all of us here in the U.S. they are currently working through their IDE submission, which we expect shortly to the FDA. And they already have their 270,000 sample cohort. And so really \u2013 it\u2019s watching to see how the shelter-in-place requirements come back and people can get back into their labs. But they are making progress on their IDE submission, which is what they are working on. In terms of the clinical market, as I said in the prepared remarks, the clinical markets have been somewhat more resilient than the research markets, but they are operating at below the baseline that we saw in Q4. And primarily that\u2019s because you have patients around the world that are holding back from going into hospitals, and in some cases are under their own shelter-in-place requirements. The reality is though for cancer patients they do need to get that testing and so at some point it will be important for them to get back to the clinic to do the oncology tests. And then in NIPT again, there is sort of a time urgency around getting that test and we saw some easing from a reimbursement perspective here in the US around covering average risk from sort of large carriers here, because they recognize that NIPT is an easier test to do than the alternatives. And so we expect NIPT to be more resilient even for the clinical markets. In terms of pandemic surveillance, we have organized an effort internally that is focused on creating the workflows that our customers are asking for and each of the categories I talked about, so for diagnostic testing, for surveillance, for ultra high throughput screening and for research. We have already put out three workflows, the shotgun metagenomics workflow, the enrichment, the amplicon workflow and we have put out some informatics tools for researchers free of charge we have been asking for in terms of helping them analyze the data around COVID-19 and also making it easier for them to submit the data they are getting to the public databases out there so they can share it more easily. At this point, the efforts have really been around ring-fencing some of our folks who work on that \u2013 on those efforts and then that\u2019s how we are thinking on. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a reallocation rather than sort of different R&D expense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi. Well, first of all, thanks for the time. Second, thank you for everything you guys are doing. My first question is something of a policy question for Francis I will apologize for giving you the more difficult one. My second is just a couple of fine-tuning points for Sam, so Sam gets the easy one. Francis, as you discuss with your policy teams, you think about the guidelines that are popping up, what do you think is the pathway for reopening for academic labs? It doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to what happens in terms of university reopenings, so there are number of questions that are operational ramp in there. There is also a question as to what is deemed \u201cessential.\u201d So I know Dan Brennan asked a good question about the timelines for those labs reopening. And for Sam, the one how do you think micro-arrays progress from here? Does the trajectory feel any different now given the environment relative to what you thought coming into the year? And then Sam, could you speak at all to the balance of stocking versus shipment delays tied to COVID and whether COVID was a net positive or negative at the end of the quarter, there is some controversy out there around stocking? Thanks so much.\nFrancis deSouza: So thank you Steve. Thank you for your comments as well. So let me start by talking about our expectations around when academic labs sort of come back up to capacity and you asked about how we think about universities reopening versus research labs opening and what those timelines are. So I will start by saying that we have very modest expectations in terms of lab for this quarter. And so that\u2019s what we have taken. You touched on an important point, which is we are hearing from our customers that likely to open up before universities do it. And that\u2019s a lot of universities are thinking in a staged way and that\u2019s the bar for opening up. It\u2019s different than the bar from bringing all undergrad students, especially back to campus. So our belief is that you will see the academic research labs and universities open up even before you see the full universities open up. The other dynamic that\u2019s playing is a number of the leading academic research labs are very actively involved in COVID-19 research. That\u2019s true across the board whether you are looking at Johns Hopkins or Yale or Stanford. And that means that the work they are doing is essential. And so a lot of them are going to be working ahead of the broader opening of the academic labs in universities. Well, that\u2019s the staging. I think first, you will see academic labs that are now focused in COVID-19 begin to scale out especially as the funding starts to slow. Next, you will see broader academic labs opening up and then finally you will see universities opening up to students probably.\nSam Samad: Yes, Steve, on your questions around the tweaks that you mentioned, so first of all, for micro-array, the micro-arrays are going to be challenged obviously significantly in Q2 just like the rest of our business to our prepared remarks and for the year, but specifically around DTC, I would say, first of all, that has continued to become a smaller portion of our business, but DTC will definitely be significantly impacted, maybe even disproportionately because as we saw in China for instance in Q1, even though that\u2019s a small part of the business, but saliva shipments were essentially banned. And so you couldn\u2019t even perform testing on DTC. And then you have some marketing that usually revolves around sporting events, the Olympics, etcetera, all of those now are pushed out. So I think DTC will be disproportionately impacted as well albeit that\u2019s a very small part of our business now. In terms of the stocking, the net impact that we mentioned $20 million, that represented a negative $24 million impact on instruments. So in the last two weeks, we definitely saw customers pausing on capital purchases and that represented a negative $24 million impact and there was a plus $4 million impact, a positive impact in terms of stocking on consumables. So, a small impact overall on consumables. So, the net impact was $20 million negative. And as you can see all of this was instruments offset by a very modest amount of consumable stocking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Based on what you described in your prepared remarks, it seems like you are describing continue to recover in China, albeit not to levels where we were earlier last year. And then it sounds like outside of China, you are describing a situation where at least at the end of April, including all end markets you were seeing stabilization. I just want to make sure that\u2019s right and building off of that, are there any areas worth noting either geographically or by end markets that are still deteriorating? And then kind of on the other side of that, are there areas that are notably improving outside of China? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Got it. Well, thank you Doug for your question. You have got it exactly right. So what we are seeing is China size business impacted first, but it has definitely started changing the trajectory and continuing to build. Similarly, if you look at the rest of the world, starting in the last couple of weeks of March, we did see a deterioration. It was sharper in the research market and more gradual in the clinical market, but they seem to have stabilized and certainly if we look at the data points for the last week, you can start to see them at least \u2013 seem to point towards the gradual building back. In terms of areas where we expect it to be above average in terms of recovery or below average, the areas that have seen resilient are the clinical areas, most specifically NIPT, but then oncology testing as well. Those are the ones that did slow down, but slowed down more slowly and the stabilization is at a higher level than the rest of the other segments that we have seen. And those are also markets that we expect to build back up more quickly given the urgency of some of the testing in those markets. We talked \u2013 we covered a lot about the research markets that the shelter-in-place requirements are going to inhibit the academic labs from reopening and we are back to play out majority of them this quarter, although some of those labs are now repurposed for COVID-19 research. And so we expect to see incremental business from that research for those markets. And in my opinion, one of the slower markets maybe to recover would be the direct-to-consumer market, directly because of the things that Sam talked about earlier.\nJacquie Ross: Hey, Brandy, since you are sitting on the next question I will just add. Just a reminder, something we said in the script was that we did see a sequential increase. The run volume data for both research and clinical at the most recent week we have actually did show a sequential increase from the prior week. So that is a positive sign there. Just one data point. We will obviously look for more data points to support that trend, but something that gives us a good amount of optimism.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nFrancis deSouza: Hi, Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: So I am going to do a multi-parter if I can. First one is easy just quantify the size of the licensing agreements that benefited services, because that number is a little bit higher than we thought. Second one is, can you talk a little bit about instrument ordering patterns are they still coming in? Have you seen things slow down, just some sort of general trends on your order pipeline right now obviously since you\u2019re not \u2013 you don\u2019t have people out there selling right now. And the other one is how much inventory and consumables your customers normally hold. And the reason I bring this up because, obviously you\u2019re going to have lab shut down and keep on going to be using things. So it\u2019s a question of when do we sort of see consumables ramp as things come back and what\u2019s the shelf life there? I\u2019m just sort of curious and what\u2019s the normal dynamics and how do we think about people bring because their using inventories before they start \u2013 before they start reordering. Do we get an air pocket? So I am just sort of trying to think about the play going through on that? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes. So with regards to the licensing revenues, Derik, we are not disclosing exactly what the amount of the licensing revenues, were for sequencing and other. But all I can tell you is, we had some licensing revenues built into our guidance that was realized in Q1. As you saw, we had growth in that line, came in slightly better than expectations. And so that\u2019s the dynamic there. In terms of the licensing revenues too, this relates to some deals that we had from last year and usually those are not necessarily all recognized at the time that you design them. There are some that you recognize afterwards based on different milestones and certain revenue recognition principles. So that\u2019s the answer to the first question. What was the second question? With regards to shelf life of consumables, so I\u2019ll jump to that. Essentially the shelf life is usually around six months to nine months effectively. So that\u2019s usually what customers have in terms of what our consumable shelf life is. And what was the third question that Derik had.\nFrancis deSouza: The third question is on consumable inventory. So, how much do customers hold typically and how long to reorder. And so I\u2019ll just take that to say typically customers hold about eight months of inventory on hand, and just as a reminder for a lot of our reagents, the shelf life is around six months. And so if I just add a little more color on the system ordering. Certainly for the first couple of months of the quarter, we were seeing very strong ordering for systems. In fact we were seeing stronger-than-normal linearity. And we were heading for a strong quarter in terms of system orders so that even there and so with the numbers. So it was a strong quarter setting of to the last couple of weeks of March from a systems orders perspective.\nJacquie Ross: And I think as Sam mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve actually seen that continue into Q2. Right? So the orders it doesn\u2019t actually shipped so far this quarter are little bit ahead of sort of normal linearity. We\u2019re seeing orders from both clinical and research customers, but at this point actually, the strength we\u2019ve been seeing so far as been driven by research. Of course, that could change with one month of data, but it\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Francis. Thanks and thanks for the important work that you are doing in the pandemic. So first on \u2013 if I could just go back to instruments again, I was hoping if you could elaborate what you had seen or what the team has seen in the past downturns here? What do you think is the appetite for instrument purchases in situations and academic customers and some of those cases where they are getting furlough in the current time frame and when they return back to the lab, what\u2019s the expectation there? And then among the diagnostic customers, what\u2019s the expectation sort of in the second half when potentially when we are expecting things to return back to normal and we\u2019re hearing about some pent-up demand obviously significant trial shutdowns anywhere from 50% to 70% new enrollment is down. So when we think about biopsy getting to the sequencer how do we think about instrument purchases in that framework? And if I could also \u2013 if I could ask the second one just briefly on run versus revenue clarification, I just wanted to understand the run numbers that you have provided, how should \u2013 what sort of arrow bar should we think on that? Are these run counts or these runs already a reflective or inclusive of the duration of the runs and thus inclusive of the sequencing volumes that you have? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. Thank you, Puneet. So let me work my way to those questions. In terms of the appetite for instrument purchases, as Jacquie pointed out, they were running strong through the majority of Q1 and we were on track for a very strong systems quarter in Q1. And they\u2019re starting to run strong again in Q2 in the first month of Q2. The disruption we saw was not in orders, but primarily in shipments because, in the last two weeks of Q1, what happened was, the number of labs had shelter-in-place requirements and frankly weren\u2019t just physically there to be able to take the instruments of their orders. And so the disruption was not really in ordering activity, it was much more in shipments activity.And as we talk to our customers what they are telling us is, the appetite for instruments is completely driven by the demand that they are seeing, right? So if you talk to our NIPT customers or oncology testing customers, they are ordering based on the demand that they\u2019re getting from driven by a number of pregnancies that are covered and oncology testing and that they expect to recover. So they are saying we saw a tick down, but this is a central testing and so this shouldn\u2019t change and that\u2019s completely is what drives whether they get instruments or not. So we\u2019re not seeing hesitation around capital purchases or capital spend. It is really is driven by demand. And the same thing is happening on the academic side, right. So it\u2019s driven by the bonus of work that they have. They have to come back into the labs to take those shipments and so there will be a gating factor around when the shipments actually happen and that shows up in revenue and our expectation is that they will be sheltered in majority of Q2. But going out beyond that, they have budgets, they need to spend it, they still have the work that they\u2019re doing, there is now incremental work associated with COVID research that will require new instruments as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of\u2026\nFrancis deSouza: In terms of the run count. Sorry, let me just finish up the last part of the question, Puneet had which was around run counts. So the numbers we\u2019re sharing with you are truly just number of runs. They are not related to the type of run or the outset data for each run or certainly the cost per run. And so there is no direct correlation to revenue, but it does give you a sense for the level of activity in our business.\nSam Samad: And Puneet, it reflects the fact that not every single instrument that we have is connected but it reflects the fact that we have a portion of our instruments, the highest is the connectivity is an AMR. The next highest is in Europe and then APJ and very little connectivity in China. So it\u2019s a proxy, but it\u2019s a good indicator in terms of the direction that we\u2019re seeing in terms of the rebound of the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Francis, maybe just to follow-up on PopSeq, less related to the active projects and more those that were sort of sitting out there in the planning and design stage, can you comment on those? I mean are those so complex that you kind of have to expect a pause, if you were talking about large health networks, or maybe conversely. I mean is it pandemic just kind of serving as an advertisement for aggregating genomic health data. I am just wondering about the next wave of those initiatives?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Let me talk about what we are seeing Dan in terms of what\u2019s playing out in those initiatives. If an initiative is in the planning stage then a lot of the work for that planning can happen while the principles are sheltered at home. And so the work that can happen remotely is moving forward. We\u2019re seeing that even here in the US around the IDE submission for all of us. And so if that initiative is really in the planning stage, then a lot of the work and continue to happen even over this period. Some parts of a PopSeq ramp up could be impacted by the pandemic. So if you are in the midst of collecting samples for example, that would be a part of the project that would be slowed down, until people started getting back into the labs or out into the fields. Another dynamic that\u2019s playing out is, we are seeing the emergence of obviously the importance of COVID-19 element to some of these population sequencing efforts. For example, the work that Trevor Bedford did at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, was really started out as a flu population research project, that then got repurposed in the December, January, February timeframe to look for COVID ID incidents, right? And so we are starting to realize the importance of these population efforts in terms of helping combat this existing pandemic and giving us the surveillance capability into future pandemics. And so we are seeing that emerge as part of the thinking for the population sequencing efforts that are playing out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thanks. Maybe one for you Sam on the expense control, I certainly appreciate that you guys want to keep expenses controlled in the near term, but also positioned to capture the growth in the other side of this. To your point about being nimble, if things do kind of linger here, you do have initiatives to pull the cost back further. I guess what would it take for you to do that as a certain timeframe that things stay shutdown that you would kind of push a little harder on the cost side. Maybe just talk through the scenarios on that front? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. We have looked at a number of scenarios both to understand what potentially the revenue impact might be for the year and also obviously the impact on expenses. First, let me say, I mean even in the first half of the year given where we are today and what we know today, we are taking a significant amount of cost out of the business. In Q1, as you heard, we were roughly $50 million below our expectations in terms of spend. In Q2, we are expecting to be somewhere around $40 million below our expectations in terms of spend. So, we are taking quite a bit of cost out of the business and that reflects some actions around discretionary expenses, some of it\u2019s driven by travel reductions, conference, lack of attendance, etcetera. If this disruption persist and I don\u2019t want to give you a certain number of months or a very specific timeframe, but if this \u2013 if we believe that these shelter-in-place work-from-home restrictions will continue for definitely Q3 and beyond, then we have got contingency plans that we have put in place that require us to be much more, I would say, look at cutting expenses in a much more significant way and that would involve things like pausing hiring altogether. And so, stopping hiring, looking at our contract and contract sales force and temporary workers, looking at significant reduction in our capital expenses, significant reduction in our non-R&D projects. So, broad-based in terms of things that we would cut based on, now that\u2019s again, that would involve us having a view to the fact that we are going to have a more prolonged disruption that goes definitely beyond Q3. So, that\u2019s the way we are approaching it.\nJacquie Ross: Brandy, the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with BTIG.\nSung Ji Nam: Thanks for taking the question. Francis, I think you mentioned that most of the COVID-19 testing will be through PCR-based or serology testing. I was curious as to what do you think is the biggest hurdle given that we probably need unprecedented level of diagnostics over the next year or two? What\u2019s the biggest hurdle in terms of getting sequencing to take a bigger share in providing diagnostic testing? Is it the cost, the installed base, the accuracy, if you could talk about that? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, thank you for that. And certainly today, the majority of testing is being done on PCR. But looking forward, I think you can expect to see more NGS testing happen in the market. And you can expect to see it happen in the number of buckets. First, you will see more diagnostic testing of symptomatic individuals happen on NGS technology. We starting to see a number of clear lots stand up diagnostic testing using NGS capability and so you should expect to see more of that happen going forward. The second thing that will happen is you will start to see the emergence of ultra-high throughput capabilities we believe for screening of healthy individuals to get them back to work. And so there are a number of very exciting concepts being worked on by the number of customers around how you can screen very large numbers of healthy individuals to give employers confidence to bring their employees back into the workforce, to give schools confidence to bring their students back into schools. Now, there is work that needs to be done to put together those workflows and so that\u2019s what being done right now. But a lot of work is happening in that arena, because the capacity you could get from NGS and the cost per sample you could get from NGS could make that very, very compelling. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s that\u2019s happening right now. Similarly, the next bucket where you can see more NGS testing happening in the market is the area of surveillance. And it\u2019s driven in some cases by CDCs around the world. But there are other organizations too that are putting together NGS capability to monitor how this outbreak is progressing. And so for that you need NGS. So you can understand how the virus is mutating. You need NGS so you can track the geographic transmission of this virus and you\u2019re seeing that capability starting to come online. And so if I look at diagnostic testing, screening and surveillance, you should expect to see NGS to be a bigger part of the testing paradigm going forward than it is today.\nOperator: Your next question is \u2013 we do have time for one further question. And your last question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick follow-up. I think Francis you mentioned the run-rate on the research side was down 45, clinical perhaps down in high-teens. I am just \u2013 like what is your revenue mix between clinical and research and where are we on capacity utilization on the systems? The reason I am asking is when we look at the economy opening up, is there capacity utilization and these systems are running at 100% and there is a catch up in the back half? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Sure. So if you look at the breakdown of our business on the sequencing consumable side, it\u2019s about 60% research and 40% clinical. And if we think about how the market recovers, there are some areas, expect to see some catch-up right. So for example the UK Biobank initiative that was moving at a full front model going into March with lease of catch-up we expect around that initiative. Similarly patients, cancer patients that we\u2019re holding back from going into the clinic to get tested, we expect to see some catch-up happen there as well. And maybe a little bit on the NIPT side as well. And so, there are definitely parts of our business, where you can expect to see some catch-up. But there are many part of our business, we expect people to go back and finish the work that they were working on. So it\u2019s very unlikely that the work goes away. So the majority of our business will pick back up and in some cases there\u2019ll be some catch-up as well.\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.\nJacquie Ross: Thank you, Brandy. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website as well as the dial-in instructions contained in today\u2019s earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update following the close of the second quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe as we collectively work our way through these challenging times. As a global citizen and a leader in genomics, Illumina is committed to doing everything we can to support efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, help patients and public health efforts, and accelerate economic recovery. In earlier stages of the outbreak, Illumina's technology was used by Dr. Fan Wu and the team at the Shanghai Public Health Center to sequence the first complete published viral genome of what was later named SARS-CoV-2. Since then, teams all over the world have been working with Illumina's technology to identify strains and monitor mutations in support of surveillance efforts, to understand therapeutic and host response and explore sequence-based diagnostic testing as well as population screening to support back to work programs. In terms of surveillance, Dr. Trevor Bedford at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Dr. Charles Chiu at UCSF are among those monitoring virus transmission and tracking mutations. And we have donated products to the Africa CDC to expand their NGS-based surveillance capabilities for infectious disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda in some cases bringing sequencing capability to the country for the first time. Susceptibility to COVID-19 is almost certainly in part genetic. And it's important to understand the interactions between viral and host genetics to potentially identify those individuals most at risk and support the development of therapies and vaccines. We are supporting multiple collaborations with partners, including the New York Genome Center, Stanford, Adaptive Biotechnology and Genomics England to better understand the evolution of the viral genome and potential genetic factors determining an immune response. Earlier this week, Genomics Medicine Ireland announced that it will sequence COVID-19 positive samples to identify risk-bearing and protective factors for COVID-19. In terms of testing, while the majority of testing will occur using PCR and serology-based tests, there are numerous groups looking to multiplex testing using NGS. For example, one of our partners, IDbyDNA, offers clinically validated, NGS-based testing. Additionally, multiple groups are publishing papers describing the performance of NGS assays with plans for clinical validation. Finally, some customers are working on ultra-high throughput NGS-based screening tests for return to work. While these efforts are early, our teams are working to help customers meet the testing challenges that have been highlighted as critical to enable our economies to sustainably recover without placing individuals at risk. As we support our customers' efforts, I am always impressed, but rarely surprised by the innovations delivered by the Illumina team. To support COVID-19 work, we have released a number of workflows and data analytics to help identify the virus and track its transmission, including a shotgun metagenomics application to enable researchers and academics to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 and other novel pathogens for epidemiology; the application also supports the unbiased detection of co-infections and the profiling of host response genes to study co-morbidities and human immune response; an enrichment workflow for Public Health Labs to enable highly accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 and viral sequence information to optimize containment strategies and identify co-infections of other respiratory viruses that may require different treatments; an amplicon workflow to support Public Health Labs studying SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology with co-infections at higher sample volumes; and a new software toolkit that makes it easier for researchers to detect and identify SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and contribute their findings to public databases. We have made this toolkit freely available to anyone who is using an Illumina sequencer. Illumina's mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome has never been more relevant. I would like to thank the global Illumina team for their dedication to keeping our employees safe, ensuring supply for those customers who are performing critical work, whether COVID-19 related or not \u2013 and doing everything we can to contribute to combating this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the many Illumina customers and partners who are working directly to fight COVID-19. We are inspired by your drive, creativity and commitment and will do whatever we can to maximize the impact of your efforts. With that, I will move to our quarterly update. Illumina reported first quarter revenue of $859 million compared to our guidance range of $850 million to $855 million. Clearly, there are a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so I will talk about our business in three ways, so that we can share many of the insights we have, by region, by customer, and by product. Starting with the regions, China was the first to be impacted by COVID-19 and was therefore the most impacted in the quarter. As the outbreak grew, our priority was to support customers as they scaled their capabilities for COVID-19 related work. This included the installation of iSeq and MiSeq systems starting in January at one of the CDCs in the hardest hit region and supporting other CDC locations and hospitals in the country. As China implemented measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, it became difficult for patients to maintain clinical appointments for oncology and NIPT testing. As a result, both sequencing systems and sequencing consumables were lower than expected in China in the first quarter and total China revenue was $84 million. We have started to see run volumes increase in China in March and April. It's not back to business as normal, but we are seeing both research and clinical customers returning to their labs in China and scaling up their operations. EMEA and AMR were resilient to COVID-19 through much of the first quarter and were tracking above our expectations in February. Momentum slowed quickly in mid-March as the wave of closure and shelter-in-place orders flooded across these regions in the closing weeks. Both EMEA and AMR still beat our expectations for the first quarter, but were clearly impacted by COVID-19. First, total system shipments were lower than expected in both AMR and EMEA. Systems tend to be back-end loaded in any given quarter and system purchases were not considered high priority for many customers at the end of the first quarter. Second, we saw some customers preemptively stocking up on sequencing consumables. Total EMEA revenue was $221 million and total AMR revenue was $477 million. Finally, APJ delivered revenue of $77 million, with solid sequencing consumable growth, including record shipments in Japan, despite COVID-19 related headwinds. In fact, this was a record quarter for APJ overall, with the highest total revenue ever reported for that region. We expect Q2 to be an extremely challenging quarter, with revenue declining sequentially in each region, albeit more modestly in China. On a positive note, Illumina's operations have stayed up and running globally, and so far we have been able to overcome any COVID-19 related challenges and deliver products to our customers in a consistent and timely manner. Moving to a customer view, it is clear that COVID-19 is impacting different customers in different ways, and we have some insights drawn from the volume of runs associated with our connected network of sequencing systems. While not all our systems are connected, we believe this is a useful reference that shows the general activity trend across our installed base. Runs are reported regardless of volume of sequencing output and are not directly correlated to revenue. First, both research and clinical runs were ramping well throughout the quarter, peaking during the week ending March 14th. Not surprisingly, the number of research and applied runs started to slow during the week beginning March 15th, especially among academic institutions. This reflects research labs scaling back in response to shelter-in-place requirements, for those not working directly on COVID-19. The decline was rapid in the second half of March, but then stabilized quite quickly, and has been roughly flat since the beginning of April. Overall, research volume is running at close to 55% of what it was in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving to clinical, run volume was impacted by COVID-19, but was somewhat more resilient than research. Clinical runs also reached their high point for the quarter during the week ending March 14th. In the week beginning March 15th, clinical run volumes started to decline, albeit more slowly than we saw in research. Unlike some of our research customers, many of our clinical customers are considered essential healthcare services and have remained open, although sample volume is being impacted as patients avoid healthcare facilities. While more modest, the clinical declines extended for four weeks, and we started to see stabilization in the week beginning April 12th. Clinical volume is currently running at just over 80% of what it was in the fourth quarter of last year. In summary, the shape of the curve has been a little different for research and clinical customers. Research run volume dropped faster, but also stabilized more quickly, and has been roughly flat for the last four weeks. The clinical run volume drop was more gentle but the duration was longer before stabilizing in the last two weeks. Both research and clinical run volume increased modestly on a sequential basis in the week beginning April 19, although it is clearly too early to call any kind of trend. Finally, moving to the revenue view, total sequencing system revenue of $79 million was down 25% from the same quarter of last year, and substantially below our expectations driven by COVID-19 disruption. Excluding the COVID-19 impact on sequencing systems, we would have comfortably exceeded our sequencing system revenue expectation for the quarter. However, system shipments were down across all families, with the exception of NextSeq 2000 in its first quarter of launch. First customer shipments of our NextSeq 2000 were delivered right on time on March 9. Orders for the system were in-line with our internal forecast for the first quarter, but shipments were lower than expected because of the COVID-19 disruption at the end of the quarter. Early adopters of the NextSeq 2000 included both existing and new Illumina customers in research and academic institutions across all four regions. Initial NextSeq 2000 applications included food safety, genetic disease, cancer, and COVID-19 research. We did not ship any new NextSeq 2000s to HiSeq conversion customers in the first quarter. The sales funnel so far is consistent with our expectation for very modest cannibalization of NovaSeq conversions among remaining HiSeq customers in the quarters ahead. Finally, almost half of the new NextSeq 2000s shipped were too new to Illumina system customers, ahead of our expectations. Sequencing consumable revenue of $553 million grew 15% from the same quarter last year and was stronger than expected. Less than half of the sequencing consumable beat was associated with COVID-19 related stocking among our clinical customers. NovaSeq pull-through per system was higher than the same quarter last year and comfortably within the previous guidance of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per NovaSeq per year. We do expect NovaSeq pull-through to step down meaningfully in the second quarter. Pull-through for both MiSeq and our NextSeq 500 and 550s was flat with last quarter, and MiniSeq was below its targeted pull through range. Sequencing service and other revenue was $128 million, up 13% due to higher licensing revenue compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, sequencing revenue of $760 million was slightly ahead of our expectation, and represented 88% of total revenue. Moving to arrays, total array revenue was $99 million, down 33% from the same quarter last year, and in-line with our expectations for the first quarter. Our array services business grew sequentially as we expected, given the normal seasonality associated with DTC, but declined year-over-year. Array consumables declined both sequentially and year- over-year, consistent with our expectations of the DTC market. In summary, our business was impacted negatively overall by over $20 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by sequencing instruments, but this was partially offset by a modest contribution from COVID-19 related stocking, and broader strength across sequencing consumables and sequencing service and other. With that, I'll hand it over to Sam to discuss the financials in more detail. Thank you, Sam. We are mindful of the balance between navigating the uncertain duration of this pandemic and ensuring that we don't do anything that slows our pipeline of innovation or otherwise inhibits our ability to meet the needs of our customers. We are hopeful that the biggest impact will be felt in the second quarter, but ensuring that we are well prepared if it extends into the second half of the year. As challenging as the current environment is, we don't see any change to the long-term trajectory of sequencing adoption and demand. Clinical testing has proved quite resilient even in these challenging times, highlighting the importance and medical value of genomic testing. While it's true that some labs have paused their research operations, it's also clear that a number of research labs are switching to COVID-19 related projects. Clearly, we have a lot of work to do to find our way out of this pandemic and then prepare for the next one. It's reassuring to see that governments around the world are committing resources to this important work. For example, the last two relief packages from the United States government has allocated over $1 billion to the CDC, with the specific goal of building out surveillance and other capabilities in the hope that we can be better prepared for the next time. We do not believe that there is a technological limitation to getting this done. And it's clear that sequencing will be at the heart of the solution. It is a challenging time to be running a business. But the Illumina community, including our employees, our suppliers, our partners and our customers has never been more united to a cause or more convinced of the importance of our shared work. We are leaving no stone unturned as we actively look for more and more ways to contribute to the effort. With that, we can start the Q&A. Thank you, Dan. So let me go through each of your questions. The first question was around the academic market. How quickly will that ramp-up when people get back to work and is there a possibility for them to catch up on the consumables or capital purchase? Let me start with that one. Let me start by acknowledging really some of the terrific work that some of our academic research customers have been doing over the last few months under some very challenging circumstances. I talked a little bit about the work that Professor Bedford was doing out at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, Charles Chiu at UCSF, really we've seen our researchers really jump all in to help us combat the pandemic and understand the mutations in the virus, the transmission vectors and the host response. In terms of how quickly that business could ramp back up. Now that business is going to continue to be impacted as long as the shelter-in-place mandates remain in effect. But once those mandates get lifted, we expect that business to start to ramp fairly quickly. What's happening is that some of the work that they're doing isn't going away. And so we expect them to be able to pick up on projects when they get back into the office \u2013 into the labs. And we expect to see a number of things happen. One, in some cases and it is certainly true with the [indiscernible] for example at the UK Biobank where there will be an attempt to catch up on the time work, but there is an urgency to the work that they are doing. In other cases you will see some academic customers we expect be granted extensions to their current funding window. So they can finish the projects that we've been working on. And frankly as we think through our research customers, it's hard to think of examples where the work they're doing goes away. Another dynamic is blood count that's becoming very clear that there is a need for research to be done on the COVID-19 pandemic itself to understand things like the evolution of the viral genome, really also understand the genetic factors that are \u2013 that create risk, that provide protective factors for individuals, understand the origins of the virus and there is work going on in single cell research to understand how a cell evolves when the virus enters the cell and so there is an emerging need for additional research to be done and we expect our academic customers and our commercial research customers to be involved with that through this quarter and certainly in the coming quarters as well. And so we expect to see that work ramp up as well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there is funding that's been allocated to the NIH, to the CDC in the UK, there is research to the COVID-19 genomics UK consortium that will fund that research. And then to your second question around the opportunity for NGS in COVID-19 testing, there are number of places where COVID \u2013 the NGS is being used in testing. One is there are customers of ours as I mentioned in the remarks that are using NGS based assays to do diagnostic testing. They're adding to the capacity in the market using NGS based assays. So that's one thing we're seeing. Secondly, we're seeing the need for NGS technologies to be used in surveillance capabilities. And that's true in CDC, starting with the CDC in China, but now it's true in CDCs around the world and we recently just shipped CDCs to a number of countries in Africa, as well. So there is another need for NGS to be used in surveillance capabilities. Another area that's emerging is the idea of using ultra high throughput screening testing to bring people back to work and so there are concepts being developed by customers of ours around using NGS to deliver that ultra high throughput screening capability to move healthy people back to work and in some cases to do regular testing to keep healthy people back at work. And so we're seeing that emerge as a possibility as well for NGS based testing. And then finally, there is a whole area around using NGS to do the research and whether that's to develop additional diagnostic tests or for therapies or to understand host responses, we we're seeing that emerge as another need for NGS as well. Sure. So, let's go through each of those questions. First, let's start with an update on PopGen. And it's clear that the shelter-in-place requirements have actually impacted the PopGen programs. And I'll talk about some of the major ones. As you might have heard from the NHS, we are waiting to hear revised dates to when they ramp-up. They haven't put out any new dates yet. So we're continuing to stay engaged with them and they're evaluating their plans around the ramp-up that was planned over the back half of this year. The UK Biobank and [indiscernible] announced in March that they were pausing they're sequencing and they said for a three month period. Now there is urgency around that work and so in that effort we expect that when they start sequencing again, they will ramp up very quickly, and they were running at about 10,000 genomes a month before they paused, so we expect them to be able to ramp that up pretty quickly. And they are the kind of customer that would invest to catch up in terms of the sequencing that was missed. Because there's value to the data they are getting from a therapy perspective and there is also a finite window of exclusivity with that data, and so there is an urgency around getting back up to speed and catching up. In terms of all of us here in the U.S. they are currently working through their IDE submission, which we expect shortly to the FDA. And they already have their 270,000 sample cohort. And so really \u2013 it's watching to see how the shelter-in-place requirements come back and people can get back into their labs. But they are making progress on their IDE submission, which is what they are working on. In terms of the clinical market, as I said in the prepared remarks, the clinical markets have been somewhat more resilient than the research markets, but they are operating at below the baseline that we saw in Q4. And primarily that's because you have patients around the world that are holding back from going into hospitals, and in some cases are under their own shelter-in-place requirements. The reality is though for cancer patients they do need to get that testing and so at some point it will be important for them to get back to the clinic to do the oncology tests. And then in NIPT again, there is sort of a time urgency around getting that test and we saw some easing from a reimbursement perspective here in the US around covering average risk from sort of large carriers here, because they recognize that NIPT is an easier test to do than the alternatives. And so we expect NIPT to be more resilient even for the clinical markets. In terms of pandemic surveillance, we have organized an effort internally that is focused on creating the workflows that our customers are asking for and each of the categories I talked about, so for diagnostic testing, for surveillance, for ultra high throughput screening and for research. We have already put out three workflows, the shotgun metagenomics workflow, the enrichment, the amplicon workflow and we have put out some informatics tools for researchers free of charge we have been asking for in terms of helping them analyze the data around COVID-19 and also making it easier for them to submit the data they are getting to the public databases out there so they can share it more easily. At this point, the efforts have really been around ring-fencing some of our folks who work on that \u2013 on those efforts and then that's how we are thinking on. So, it's a little bit of a reallocation rather than sort of different R&D expense. So thank you Steve. Thank you for your comments as well. So let me start by talking about our expectations around when academic labs sort of come back up to capacity and you asked about how we think about universities reopening versus research labs opening and what those timelines are. So I will start by saying that we have very modest expectations in terms of lab for this quarter. And so that's what we have taken. You touched on an important point, which is we are hearing from our customers that likely to open up before universities do it. And that's a lot of universities are thinking in a staged way and that's the bar for opening up. It's different than the bar from bringing all undergrad students, especially back to campus. So our belief is that you will see the academic research labs and universities open up even before you see the full universities open up. The other dynamic that's playing is a number of the leading academic research labs are very actively involved in COVID-19 research. That's true across the board whether you are looking at Johns Hopkins or Yale or Stanford. And that means that the work they are doing is essential. And so a lot of them are going to be working ahead of the broader opening of the academic labs in universities. Well, that's the staging. I think first, you will see academic labs that are now focused in COVID-19 begin to scale out especially as the funding starts to slow. Next, you will see broader academic labs opening up and then finally you will see universities opening up to students probably. Got it. Well, thank you Doug for your question. You have got it exactly right. So what we are seeing is China size business impacted first, but it has definitely started changing the trajectory and continuing to build. Similarly, if you look at the rest of the world, starting in the last couple of weeks of March, we did see a deterioration. It was sharper in the research market and more gradual in the clinical market, but they seem to have stabilized and certainly if we look at the data points for the last week, you can start to see them at least \u2013 seem to point towards the gradual building back. In terms of areas where we expect it to be above average in terms of recovery or below average, the areas that have seen resilient are the clinical areas, most specifically NIPT, but then oncology testing as well. Those are the ones that did slow down, but slowed down more slowly and the stabilization is at a higher level than the rest of the other segments that we have seen. And those are also markets that we expect to build back up more quickly given the urgency of some of the testing in those markets. We talked \u2013 we covered a lot about the research markets that the shelter-in-place requirements are going to inhibit the academic labs from reopening and we are back to play out majority of them this quarter, although some of those labs are now repurposed for COVID-19 research. And so we expect to see incremental business from that research for those markets. And in my opinion, one of the slower markets maybe to recover would be the direct-to-consumer market, directly because of the things that Sam talked about earlier. Hi, Derik. The third question is on consumable inventory. So, how much do customers hold typically and how long to reorder. And so I'll just take that to say typically customers hold about eight months of inventory on hand, and just as a reminder for a lot of our reagents, the shelf life is around six months. And so if I just add a little more color on the system ordering. Certainly for the first couple of months of the quarter, we were seeing very strong ordering for systems. In fact we were seeing stronger-than-normal linearity. And we were heading for a strong quarter in terms of system orders so that even there and so with the numbers. So it was a strong quarter setting of to the last couple of weeks of March from a systems orders perspective. Sure. Thank you, Puneet. So let me work my way to those questions. In terms of the appetite for instrument purchases, as Jacquie pointed out, they were running strong through the majority of Q1 and we were on track for a very strong systems quarter in Q1. And they're starting to run strong again in Q2 in the first month of Q2. The disruption we saw was not in orders, but primarily in shipments because, in the last two weeks of Q1, what happened was, the number of labs had shelter-in-place requirements and frankly weren't just physically there to be able to take the instruments of their orders. And so the disruption was not really in ordering activity, it was much more in shipments activity.And as we talk to our customers what they are telling us is, the appetite for instruments is completely driven by the demand that they are seeing, right? So if you talk to our NIPT customers or oncology testing customers, they are ordering based on the demand that they're getting from driven by a number of pregnancies that are covered and oncology testing and that they expect to recover. So they are saying we saw a tick down, but this is a central testing and so this shouldn't change and that's completely is what drives whether they get instruments or not. So we're not seeing hesitation around capital purchases or capital spend. It is really is driven by demand. And the same thing is happening on the academic side, right. So it's driven by the bonus of work that they have. They have to come back into the labs to take those shipments and so there will be a gating factor around when the shipments actually happen and that shows up in revenue and our expectation is that they will be sheltered in majority of Q2. But going out beyond that, they have budgets, they need to spend it, they still have the work that they're doing, there is now incremental work associated with COVID research that will require new instruments as well. In terms of the run count. Sorry, let me just finish up the last part of the question, Puneet had which was around run counts. So the numbers we're sharing with you are truly just number of runs. They are not related to the type of run or the outset data for each run or certainly the cost per run. And so there is no direct correlation to revenue, but it does give you a sense for the level of activity in our business. Yes. Let me talk about what we are seeing Dan in terms of what's playing out in those initiatives. If an initiative is in the planning stage then a lot of the work for that planning can happen while the principles are sheltered at home. And so the work that can happen remotely is moving forward. We're seeing that even here in the US around the IDE submission for all of us. And so if that initiative is really in the planning stage, then a lot of the work and continue to happen even over this period. Some parts of a PopSeq ramp up could be impacted by the pandemic. So if you are in the midst of collecting samples for example, that would be a part of the project that would be slowed down, until people started getting back into the labs or out into the fields. Another dynamic that's playing out is, we are seeing the emergence of obviously the importance of COVID-19 element to some of these population sequencing efforts. For example, the work that Trevor Bedford did at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, was really started out as a flu population research project, that then got repurposed in the December, January, February timeframe to look for COVID ID incidents, right? And so we are starting to realize the importance of these population efforts in terms of helping combat this existing pandemic and giving us the surveillance capability into future pandemics. And so we are seeing that emerge as part of the thinking for the population sequencing efforts that are playing out. Yes, thank you for that. And certainly today, the majority of testing is being done on PCR. But looking forward, I think you can expect to see more NGS testing happen in the market. And you can expect to see it happen in the number of buckets. First, you will see more diagnostic testing of symptomatic individuals happen on NGS technology. We starting to see a number of clear lots stand up diagnostic testing using NGS capability and so you should expect to see more of that happen going forward. The second thing that will happen is you will start to see the emergence of ultra-high throughput capabilities we believe for screening of healthy individuals to get them back to work. And so there are a number of very exciting concepts being worked on by the number of customers around how you can screen very large numbers of healthy individuals to give employers confidence to bring their employees back into the workforce, to give schools confidence to bring their students back into schools. Now, there is work that needs to be done to put together those workflows and so that's what being done right now. But a lot of work is happening in that arena, because the capacity you could get from NGS and the cost per sample you could get from NGS could make that very, very compelling. And so, that's what's that's happening right now. Similarly, the next bucket where you can see more NGS testing happening in the market is the area of surveillance. And it's driven in some cases by CDCs around the world. But there are other organizations too that are putting together NGS capability to monitor how this outbreak is progressing. And so for that you need NGS. So you can understand how the virus is mutating. You need NGS so you can track the geographic transmission of this virus and you're seeing that capability starting to come online. And so if I look at diagnostic testing, screening and surveillance, you should expect to see NGS to be a bigger part of the testing paradigm going forward than it is today. Yes. Sure. So if you look at the breakdown of our business on the sequencing consumable side, it's about 60% research and 40% clinical. And if we think about how the market recovers, there are some areas, expect to see some catch-up right. So for example the UK Biobank initiative that was moving at a full front model going into March with lease of catch-up we expect around that initiative. Similarly patients, cancer patients that we're holding back from going into the clinic to get tested, we expect to see some catch-up happen there as well. And maybe a little bit on the NIPT side as well. And so, there are definitely parts of our business, where you can expect to see some catch-up. But there are many part of our business, we expect people to go back and finish the work that they were working on. So it's very unlikely that the work goes away. So the majority of our business will pick back up and in some cases there'll be some catch-up as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Francis. And thanks to you all for joining us today. I really hope you and your families are safe and healthy. As discussed, first quarter revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $859 million, slightly with sequencing consumables and sequencing services and other, offsetting softer than expected sequencing system revenue. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. Non-GAAP gross margin of 73.0% was higher than our expectations, with lower sequencing system revenue and higher sequencing consumable and other revenue resulting in a more favorable mix in addition to increased fixed cost leverage as we increased safety stock volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $339 million were down $33 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, and down $24 million from the first quarter of 2019. This was lower than we expected due to delayed project spend, reduced labor- related expenses and less travel. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up from 31.0% last quarter, and better than expected. The non-GAAP tax rate of 16.1% was down from last quarter and lower than expected due to prior year return adjustments and discrete tax benefits related to the release of tax reserves. For the first quarter of 2020, GAAP net income was $173 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $243 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Additionally in the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $281 million; First quarter capital expenditures were $40 million and free cash flow was $241 million. DSO of 50 days compared to 55 days last quarter due to more favorable revenue linearity. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This is down from $3.4 billion reported at the end of 2019, due to $187 million in share repurchases in the first quarter, and $132 million for the reverse termination fee and continuation advances paid to Pacific Biosciences. The expenses related to the PacBio payments are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 148 million. We have $563 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. Looking forward, we have withdrawn all our previous guidance due to the uncertainties around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. To be very clear, this includes our revenue and EPS guidance, in addition to any other forward-looking comments we have made on NovaSeq or other system portal, NextSeq 1000 and 2000 shipments and PopGen expectations for the year. One month in, we can see that the second quarter impact will be substantially greater than the impact we experienced in the first quarter and we are planning accordingly. As mentioned before, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in every region in the second quarter with the smallest dollar decline expected in China and the largest in AMR. While we have so far been able to produce and deliver to our customers with minimal delays in the first quarter, we note a higher risk of transportation delays associated with border closures and a drop in air freight capacity linked to fewer passenger flights. Again, these are not impacting our business today, but are risks as we look forward. Given the wide range of possible outcomes, we are not offering guidance on second quarter revenue at this time. Even though we are not providing second quarter guidance, we can share some qualitative comments about factors that will impact our P&L in the second quarter. For example, it is clear that substantially lower revenue will lower our gross margin, so you should expect a lower gross margin in the second quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. In terms of operating expense, we remain committed to investing strategically to ensure that we protect the strength of our business when we emerge on the other side of the COVID-19 disruption. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be roughly flat on a dollar basis compared to the second quarter of last year. Illumina is an innovation engine and while we have de-prioritized some work we will do everything we can to retain our most important product development timelines. That said we are managing expenses very carefully. In the near-term, there are savings associated with restricted discretionary expenses, including travel, marketing events and consulting and slower hiring associated with a lengthening hiring cycle. We are also reducing spend on contract and temporary labor in certain functions. Finally, we have delayed certain non-R&D projects and delayed or canceled certain capital expenditure projects. Compared to our original budget for the year, second quarter operating expenses have been reduced by more than $40 million. We are also preparing for additional cost savings opportunities if shelter-in-place orders remain prevalent into the third quarter. While we are all hoping for loosening of restrictions in the near future, we have planned for a range of scenarios that we can activate if needed. We will monitor the situation carefully throughout the rest of the second quarter to assess whether we need to take more aggressive actions more quickly. This includes a careful reassessment of our capital investment plans and gating programs in some cases. In the meantime, we continue to hire and on-board new team members virtually, but retain the flexibility to pause or limit hiring or slow other investments if the pandemic is prolonged. With that, I will hand the call back over to Francis. Dan, I'll offer up one data point, this is Sam. In the first quarter \u2013 first month, I should say of Q2, we've also seen stronger than expected instrument shipments actually to academic institutions. So that's a testament to the resiliency of that part of the market, despite the fact that we're still in shelter-in-place more than disruption. So we are confident that once we get past this pandemic that this will rebound, both in terms of instruments and in terms of consumable utilization as well. Yes, Steve, on your questions around the tweaks that you mentioned, so first of all, for micro-array, the micro-arrays are going to be challenged obviously significantly in Q2 just like the rest of our business to our prepared remarks and for the year, but specifically around DTC, I would say, first of all, that has continued to become a smaller portion of our business, but DTC will definitely be significantly impacted, maybe even disproportionately because as we saw in China for instance in Q1, even though that's a small part of the business, but saliva shipments were essentially banned. And so you couldn't even perform testing on DTC. And then you have some marketing that usually revolves around sporting events, the Olympics, etcetera, all of those now are pushed out. So I think DTC will be disproportionately impacted as well albeit that's a very small part of our business now. In terms of the stocking, the net impact that we mentioned $20 million, that represented a negative $24 million impact on instruments. So in the last two weeks, we definitely saw customers pausing on capital purchases and that represented a negative $24 million impact and there was a plus $4 million impact, a positive impact in terms of stocking on consumables. So, a small impact overall on consumables. So, the net impact was $20 million negative. And as you can see all of this was instruments offset by a very modest amount of consumable stocking. Yes. So with regards to the licensing revenues, Derik, we are not disclosing exactly what the amount of the licensing revenues, were for sequencing and other. But all I can tell you is, we had some licensing revenues built into our guidance that was realized in Q1. As you saw, we had growth in that line, came in slightly better than expectations. And so that's the dynamic there. In terms of the licensing revenues too, this relates to some deals that we had from last year and usually those are not necessarily all recognized at the time that you design them. There are some that you recognize afterwards based on different milestones and certain revenue recognition principles. So that's the answer to the first question. What was the second question? With regards to shelf life of consumables, so I'll jump to that. Essentially the shelf life is usually around six months to nine months effectively. So that's usually what customers have in terms of what our consumable shelf life is. And what was the third question that Derik had. And Puneet, it reflects the fact that not every single instrument that we have is connected but it reflects the fact that we have a portion of our instruments, the highest is the connectivity is an AMR. The next highest is in Europe and then APJ and very little connectivity in China. So it's a proxy, but it's a good indicator in terms of the direction that we're seeing in terms of the rebound of the business. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. We have looked at a number of scenarios both to understand what potentially the revenue impact might be for the year and also obviously the impact on expenses. First, let me say, I mean even in the first half of the year given where we are today and what we know today, we are taking a significant amount of cost out of the business. In Q1, as you heard, we were roughly $50 million below our expectations in terms of spend. In Q2, we are expecting to be somewhere around $40 million below our expectations in terms of spend. So, we are taking quite a bit of cost out of the business and that reflects some actions around discretionary expenses, some of it's driven by travel reductions, conference, lack of attendance, etcetera. If this disruption persist and I don't want to give you a certain number of months or a very specific timeframe, but if this \u2013 if we believe that these shelter-in-place work-from-home restrictions will continue for definitely Q3 and beyond, then we have got contingency plans that we have put in place that require us to be much more, I would say, look at cutting expenses in a much more significant way and that would involve things like pausing hiring altogether. And so, stopping hiring, looking at our contract and contract sales force and temporary workers, looking at significant reduction in our capital expenses, significant reduction in our non-R&D projects. So, broad-based in terms of things that we would cut based on, now that's again, that would involve us having a view to the fact that we are going to have a more prolonged disruption that goes definitely beyond Q3. So, that's the way we are approaching it."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to share with you how our commitment to innovation is driving growth and unlocking the power of the genome. My comments will cover a few key areas, starting with our strong finish and exceptional results for 2021, followed by how our platforms and markets drove those results. I'll then conclude by highlighting a few of the many trends that will support our momentum and continued growth in 2022 and beyond. Let's start with our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Fourth quarter revenue of approximately $1.2 billion increased 26% year-over-year, with strong growth across both instruments and consumables and across all regions. Full year 2021 revenue of more than $4.5 billion, increased 40% year-over-year, reflecting 76% growth in sequencing instruments and 43% growth in sequencing consumables. We're seeing record demand for our instruments across the throughput spectrum and across geographies. In 2021, we shipped more than 3,200 sequencing instruments and added more than 930 new instrument customers, over 50% more than in 2020 or 2019. Delving now into each of our platforms, starting with high throughput. We shipped 384 NovaSeq units in 2021, with more than one-third of those instruments for oncology testing. Approximately 50% of NovaSeq orders in 2021 were to new to high throughput or new to Illumina customers. 2021 NovaSeq consumable pull-through of more than $1.3 million per instrument was the highest ever average even with over double the placement compared to last year. Moving to mid-throughput. In 2021, we shipped more than 1,100 NextSeq systems, surpassing 1,000 for the first time and nearly doubling 2020 shipments. This volume was driven by growing NextSeq 550 demand in clinical applications like oncology testing and reproductive health, as well as NextSeq 1000 and 2000 demand as customers expand into multi-omic application. More than 20% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 units this year were placed with new to Illumina customers as we continue to see new customers using higher throughput applications. For low throughput, in 2021, we shipped more than 1,600 units, another record, driven in part by the addition of more than 700 new customers. Looking at our continued strong growth through the lens of our market, our clinical markets currently include testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. In 2021, our consumable shipments to clinical markets grew 42%, driven in particular by oncology testing, where many customers are building out comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, and expanding into liquid biopsy and monitoring. We continue to see expanding opportunities for our oncology products globally, including new studies launching in Europe and Asia, with our research-use only TruSight Oncology 500 assay. For example, our recent joint research project with the National Cancer Center Japan will develop personalized cancer treatments for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a cancer that occurs more frequently in Asia. And our partnership with the Jean Perrin Center at the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital in France, will assess the clinical value of CGP in patients with late-stage disease compared to the current standard of care. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to see strong momentum. GRAIL launched the Galleri test last year as the first clinically validated, multi-cancer early detection test to be available to patients and providers. Galleri can detect more than 50 types of cancer, most of which have no current screening. It's great to see the initial market reception with multiple large employers and payers adopting Galleri and more than 1,500 prescribing partners, including participation from leading health systems like the NHS, the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. The team continues to collaborate with pharmaceutical partners like AstraZeneca, Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb on potential new innovations in the post diagnostic space. Finally, the recent initiatives launched in the U.S. and EU to beat cancer are very encouraging. The U.S.\u2019 Cancer Moonshot National Initiative and Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan highlight the increasing recognition of early detection as a critical component in the fight against cancer. Illumina is deeply committed to supporting all early detection, oncology testing and treatment initiatives to improve care and save lives. Beyond oncology, reproductive health also had a strong year in 2021. This was driven in part by revised American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, guidelines enabling genetic testing coverage for all U.S. pregnancies, as well as increasing adoption of our VeriSeq NIPT V2 product globally. Our third clinical market, genetic disease testing, saw tremendous growth and additional evidence generation in 2021. With significant publications in both the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Pediatrics affirming the clinical utility of whole genome sequencing, or WGS, for critically ill children. In 2022, we're already seeing an increase in coverage with California, Oregon and Maryland Medicaid initiating coverage for WGS in the NICU setting. Expansion of programs for WGS and NICU settings are also occurring globally, including our recent project with Germany's Hannover Medical School to implement the use of WGS in NICU patients. This program contributes to a growing body of evidence from other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in states across the U.S., showing that WGS offers significant benefits for diagnosis of genetic disease in critically ill infants, along with cost efficiencies for health systems. Turning to our research and applied markets, consumables grew 43% in 2021, driven by projects like All of Us, along with ongoing COVID surveillance efforts, that contributed approximately $220 million in total revenue. I'd now like to spend a few minutes on three key trends that will drive long-term growth. First, is the continued deepening and expansion of Illumina's addressable markets. We're seeing further penetration of our existing markets through increased access and adoption. The use of sequencing is proliferating globally across applications, and new initiatives continue to integrate genomics into national health care systems. Our technology and genomics expertise are enabling programs like Our Future Health, the UK's largest-ever health research program that will deliver genetic analysis of DNA samples from up to five million volunteers. This data will be used for a variety of potential discoveries, including new signals to detect diseases earlier, new ways to better predict high-risk population for diseases and new personalized therapies or tools to delay diseases or change the course of their progression. We're excited to play a role in this project as the genotyping partner for the program. We also continue to support a growing global COVID surveillance network that will extend to broader pan pathogen and genomic epidemiology work. This infrastructure is already being used to study other infectious diseases. For example, in South Africa, Dr. Tulio de Oliveira\u2019s team at CERI, the Center for Epidemic Response and Innovation, is using their fleet of sequencers to study other communicable diseases like HIV and malaria. We expect additional opportunities for epidemiology applications in the future as global funding for pathogen surveillance and research expand. And new sequencing applications and opportunities are growing and evolving rapidly, including in multiple nascent spaces like multi-omics and drug development. We're supporting the spectrum of multi-omic applications across our instruments, including proteomics, where our co-development partnership with SomaLogic is off to a strong start. We're also catalyzing growth in drug discovery, where genomic-based methods can dramatically improve speed to market, success rates and costs. In addition to our partnership with Nashville Biosciences, we're collaborating with the Montreal Neurological Institute Hospital, Takeda and Roche to enable large-scale analysis of patient data and identify promising targets for drug development in neurological diseases. Programs like Our Future Health, growing applications and increasing global access will support long-term adoption of NGS. The new markets we're opening like drug discovery will further enable adoption, while also improving data equity and the integration of genomics into health care. We're experiencing this increasing demand for genomics as we enter 2022, with our instrument backlog almost twice the size it was entering 2021. A second trend is the multifaceted growth in our customer base. Our existing customers are growing their instrument fleet. We're also seeing increasing numbers of customers new to Illumina. As a result, our installed base has grown to more than 20,000 instruments at the end of 2021. The third trend is the demand for even greater data generation. In 2021, an average Illumina high-throughput customer generated approximately 4x more data than in 2017. This will continue as customers need more complete genomic information and as NGS becomes standard in clinical setting. These shifts will increase the number of projects, number of samples per project and the depth of sequencing for sample as multiple tests are run per patient and samples are used for rigs across high-intensity applications like multi-omic. This demand for higher throughput sequencing will, in turn, continue to drive further growth in our sequencing consumables revenue. For 2021, between our consumables and services, more than 80% of our revenue is recurring in nature. This more predictable and profitable revenue stream provides a tremendous base to invest into the business and drive future growth. Illumina's 2021 performance and significant momentum entering 2022 demonstrate our strong position to support our customers and partners as these trends accelerate genomics in health care. I'll now turn the call over to Sam to highlight additional details on our results and operations, as well as discuss our guidance for 2022. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our fourth quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and conclude with our outlook for 2022. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. Our record fourth quarter revenue again exceeded our expectations due to continued strength in our core business, with consolidated revenue growing 26% year-over-year to $1.198 billion. For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.71 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $117 million or $0.75 per diluted share, which included $0.66 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.09 of incremental dilution from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.6%, which decreased 280 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rate. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 157 million. Moving to segment results. I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $1.193 billion, driven by another quarter of record shipments for both clinical and research, with notable strength in oncology testing, genetic disease testing and population genomics. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 32% year-over-year to $792 million, driven by record NovaSeq consumables shipments resulting from the significant growth in installed base and strong pull-through that again exceeded our guidance range. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 35% year-over-year to $191 million, driven by record NovaSeq shipments due to continued new to high throughput customer adoption and accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1000, 2000 shipments also reached a new high in the quarter, and there was strong growth across all mid and low throughput systems year-over-year. We are entering 2022 with a strong sequencing instrument backlog that is almost double the backlog entering 2021. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance again exceeded our expectations, driven by the sustained focus on variant tracking due to the emergence of the Omicron variants. During the fourth quarter, COVID-19 surveillance contributed approximately $42 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $8 million in incremental instrument revenue. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $106 million was flat year-over-year as revenue growth from instrument service contracts and lab services was offset by lower IVD partnership revenue. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $619 million, growing 25% compared to the prior year period, driven by clinical demand in oncology testing, strength in genetic disease research for pharma and population genomics initiatives like All of Us, and COVID surveillance testing. EMEA delivered revenue of $350 million, representing 23% growth year-over-year, driven by strength in emerging markets, population genomics initiatives and COVID surveillance testing. Greater China revenue was $121 million, representing growth of 26% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region driven by the growing installed base in hospitals. Finally, APJ revenue of $103 million grew 34% year-over-year, driven by record NovaSeq placements and continued momentum in clinical markets, including genetic disease testing and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.6% increased 470 basis points year-over-year due primarily to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $580 million were up $141 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth, increased performance-based compensation expenses, higher onetime partnership-related expenses and increased project spend driven by investments we are making in R&D and operations to support the growth and scale of our business. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were higher than expected due to higher variable compensation expense and higher partnership expense compared to previous expectations. Core Illumina non-GAAP other expense of $8 million was $28 million lower than other income in Q4 2020 due to lower interest income on short-term investments liquidated to fund the GRAIL acquisition, as well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. Transitioning to the financial results of for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted of Galleri test fees and MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $131 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million. DSO was 49 days compared to 50 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $70 million. And free cash flow was $212 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to grow 14% to 16% to approximately $5.16 billion to $5.25 billion. We expect full year 2022 Core Illumina revenue to grow 13% to 15% to approximately $5.11 billion to $5.2 billion. GRAIL expects its revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million for 2022, consisting primarily of Galleri test. For fiscal 2022, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 15% year-over-year, driven by accelerating demand in our base business. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument growth of approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in NovaSeq and NextSeq placements. We expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables growth of approximately 18% year-over-year, driven by our growing instrument installed base and strong utilization by our customers. We expect the strength to expand our platform, and we are raising our pull-through guidance for NovaSeq to a range of $1.2 million to $1.3 million per system for 2022. We expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000, 2000 in the range of $130,000 to $180,000 per system in 2022. And pull-through for NextSeq 550 in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 per system. For MiSeq, we expect pull-through in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 per system. And for MiniSeq, we expect pull-through in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 per system. We also expect revenue from COVID surveillance in the range of $130 million to $150 million in 2022. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 15.5% to 16%, and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% for 2022. We also expect the consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.20, which includes dilution from GRAIL of $3.75, including GRAIL operating loss dilution of approximately $3.25 and incremental dilution of approximately $0.50 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition in line with previous expectations. And finally, we expect diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 159 million shares. For the first quarter of 2022 for consolidated Illumina, we expect revenue to increase 10% to 12% year-over-year from the first quarter of 2021. This represents a sequential increase from the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting a strong start to the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase approximately 300 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses. We expect non-GAAP tax rate to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 19%. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares. For Core Illumina, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 28%. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Sam. To close, I\u2019d like to thank our teams, our network of partners and the extraordinary scientists and clinicians we serve. I am incredibly excited for the many opportunities ahead. Today, more than 1 billion people are covered for genomic testing globally, and we expect this number to double within 5 years as genomics accelerates the adoption and potential of personalized medicine. Illumina will continue to support the growing number of patients around the world, accessing the life-saving benefits of genomics from oncology therapy selection, to reproductive health, genetic disease testing and pathogen surveillance. We will also continue to push genomics to new frontiers like drug development and proteomics. Additionally, we will enable discovery across these existing and new markets with a pipeline of innovative products and solutions developed in collaboration with our customers. It has been fantastic to see the strong interest and excitement across our customer base for our latest developments, including our breakthrough Chemistry X and our Infinity long-read technology. We expect to not only directly address unmet market needs, but also revolutionized with scientists and clinicians connect spectrum sequencing. Together, we\u2019re enabling genomic-based discoveries that can transform health care and ultimately provide a brighter future for human health. I\u2019ll now invite the operator to open for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Dan Brennan with Cowen. Dan, your line is open. You can go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks. Thanks for the questions. Congrats, obviously, on the quarter. So I wanted to ask a question on the new products. Obviously, we\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this fall. But you would expect there\u2019s material interest in Chemistry X and Infinity, particularly in light of some of the expected competitive launches that will be coming between now and around HBT? So I\u2019m just wondering, you\u2019ve laid out some basic metrics on relaying to accuracy and speed and you talked about revolutionizing things and unmet needs. So I was hoping, Francis, that you could provide a little bit more color about maybe how we can think about these products? Obviously, you\u2019re not going to give us new factors at this point, but particularly around some of the unmet needs that might be addressed and/or this idea of revolutionizing things because, arguably, Illumina has done a terrific job evolving their product portfolio, driving higher throughput, lower prices, but revolutionary sounds like a pretty big word for this product. So just wondering and hoping to trying to get some more color. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks, Dan. And it has been fantastic, as I said, to see the reaction of our customers to both Chemistry X and the data we\u2019ve provided so far on Infinity. So let me go through each of them a little bit. With Chemistry X, we\u2019ve been keeping all of you in the loop over the years as we moved from the research phase then into product development and shared some of the early data, maybe just over a year ago. And then as I said a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re now moving Chemistry X from product development into manufacturing with the whole new manufacturing facility and sort of scaling up production. And so it\u2019s been terrific to see the progress and the innovations that are in Chemistry X. As I said, this is a from the ground-up rethink of our chemistry, probably the single biggest advance in our chemistry since Solexa was created all those years ago. What this means for our customers and in terms of the industry is we can expect a step change in terms of the speed of the chemistry, and that will translate into much faster turnaround times for the tests that our customers are running. And that\u2019s especially relevant for, not just very large-scale research projects, but especially in clinical settings where you do want to get some of those results to patients more quickly. It means higher accuracy and all of that combines to also enable a really exciting road map in terms of price per G. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we continue to be committed to really driving down the cost of sequencing, to make it more accessible in Chemistry X, a fundamental part of that. And so we\u2019re now entering manufacturing, and we\u2019re closer to bringing that out into products than we\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019ve talked about the fact that this is going to be foundational to all new products coming out. And there\u2019s no reason, as we look at our existing portfolio why it may not make sense in some parts of our portfolio to have it in there as well. In terms of Infinity, the excitement there is because we\u2019ve sort of rethought how people think about long reads and short reads. And again, went back to first principles to say, what customers don\u2019t want is they don\u2019t want two different platforms, one for short read and one for long read. And what they\u2019re telling you is that they want to take some of the best elements of what we\u2019ve got in SBS, high accuracy, low cost, low input requirements and apply that to all reads. And so when we looked at how we would rethink long reads, we brought some of the best of those elements and to say low input requirements, lower cost, maintain high accuracy. And they also want it to be a single molecule approach. They didn\u2019t want it to be a composite of multiple molecules. And so the team has done a fantastic job innovating to deliver that in terms of our Infinity technology. You\u2019ve seen some data from some of our customers. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re bringing it to market later this year, and you\u2019ll continue to see more data and more information from us.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho, your line is open. You can go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. On guidance, 10% sequencing instrument growth. I\u2019m just wondering if you could put a little bit more color around that. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the NovaSeq DX launch. How material do you think that could be? And then Francis, to your comments a minute ago, how do you avoid freezing the market ahead of kind of Chemistry X being rolled out? And then a follow-up on GRAIL guidance as well, $70 million to $90 million is a big step up from $10 million in the fourth quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about scale-up plans and how you plan to get there?\nSam Samad: Yes. So maybe I can start, Tycho, this is Sam. Thanks for the question about the guidance on instruments, and I\u2019ll just provide a couple of brief comments. I mean, first of all, let me say, instruments in 2021 represented incredible performance. We\u2019re entering the year now in 2022 with a record backlog of instruments. So it gives us a lot of confidence about the guide, the 10%. As we think about some of the drivers behind this, continued very strong placements of NovaSeq, continued very strong placements on the mid-throughput side with NextSeq 2000, 1000. And we talked about in 2021 the record performance across those two platforms. Now there is a headwind, which is COVID surveillance. We placed quite a few instruments for COVID surveillance in 2021. And we don\u2019t expect, frankly, to place instruments for COVID surveillance in 2022. So that\u2019s a year-over-year headwind that\u2019s factored into the 10% growth in terms of the guide. For NovaSeq DX, that\u2019s a product that we\u2019re very excited to launch. It will be launched later this year. It does not represent the material impact in terms of growth for instruments in 2022. So Francis, maybe...\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let\u2019s talk about Chemistry X and what that means in terms of our customers and how do we avoid, as you said, freezing the market potentially. One of the exciting things we hear from our customers about being with Illumina is that you\u2019re part of this exciting roadmap, and that you\u2019re not only getting access to what we provide today, but you know that we are going to continue to innovate and bring new products out. And so for our customers, it\u2019s been exciting to watch this journey of Chemistry X develop, and we\u2019ve been, I think, good about sharing the data through this whole process. So they know what\u2019s coming. They can get a sense for what it can mean for them. We don\u2019t have a new product announced, so there\u2019s nothing to freeze the market for. And our customers also know that they\u2019ve done this with us several times that whenever we introduce a new product, we do have programs in place that involve trade-ins or if you\u2019ve already placed an order and it\u2019s in our backlog, you can switch that if you wanted the new instrument. And so over the years, we\u2019ve developed a number of pretty robust programs around enabling a seamless upgrade for our customers. Now also, the other thing we\u2019ve learned is, especially in the clinical markets, that when a new instrument comes out, typically, some of our customers will buy one of the new instruments, for example, and use that to develop their new workflows, to get familiar with the new instruments and then plan an upgrade over a multiyear period. And so that could still play out. But as we introduce a new instrument in the future, they may buy one to sort of get comfortable with it, and then use that to plan and upgrade over a multiyear period. And then in terms of GRAIL, the momentum we\u2019re seeing with GRAIL has been terrific to watch. They are seeing traction, as we said, with employers. And what\u2019s been interesting there is we expected traction with financial services companies, with tech companies, some other companies that traditionally are more forward-leaning in terms of using benefits as a way to attract talent. What we are really excited about is that we\u2019re seeing customers across industries. We\u2019ve seen, as we said, large logistics players and transport players that are signed up to offer this benefit to their employees. And so that\u2019s been exciting to see. We\u2019re also really pleased with the number of prescribing providers that have now got experience with the Galleri tests. So we said there are over 1,500 prescribing providers that ordered the test in 2021 last year going into this year. And so that\u2019s a great base of health care professionals that have some experience now with Galleri and should be more comfortable ordering it going forward. In terms of the guidance, most of the guide for Galleri \u2013 for GRAIL this year is Galleri. There is a component of it associated with MRD, but it is a smaller percentage. Now as we look at that number, that could be a potential area for upside, and we\u2019ll keep watching the traction they are making in that space.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan, your line is open. You can go ahead.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Francis, just back on Chemistry X. Is there anything you can add there on the per gigabase economics that might be at play? How much cheaper do you think genome pricing could be for the NovaSeq crowd? And then for the mid and lower throughput users, should those folks also see a cost of sequencing decrease if they\u2019re running a NextSeq or a MiSeq? And then if I could just sneak in a second one. On the Nashville Biosciences collaboration, what\u2019s the time line for the 250,000 samples that I think you\u2019re sequencing there? And is that all whole-genome? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me start with Chemistry X and what it could mean. We know, just apples-to-apples, Chemistry 1 versus Chemistry X that you will get significant cost reductions as you [Technical Difficulty] yet. Now ultimately, that looks like depends on everything else we think [Technical Difficulty] so ultimately, [Technical Difficulty] cost per key will be partially chemistry. So we have to look at optics [Technical Difficulty] all of that. It\u2019s a little early to stay with the specific impact. It depends on [Technical Difficulty] depends on the entire oncology [Technical Difficulty] were specific about what that give you specifics [Technical Difficulty] the price. But we will be very confident that a giant part [Technical Difficulty] cost reduction with chemistry. [Technical Difficulty] And this have a specific additional detail [Technical Difficulty] Nashville as that comes to get [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Francis, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. I don\u2019t know if you want to try to fix that or if you want to try to restate your answer there or anything like that.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Let me \u2013 just the summary I\u2019ll say on Chemistry X is it gives us a big step forward in terms of delivering price reductions, in terms of sequencing for our customers. But ultimately, the specific number will depend on the type of instrument we build it into, as well as the other components with the technology ecosystem that we built into that instrument. The data path, the optics and so on. And so stay tuned as we get more specific, we will share that with you.\nOperator: Okay. Great. That sounded much better. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay, your line is open. You can go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the print, and I had a question on the guidance here. Sam, your Q1 revenue guidance up sequentially. I guess we haven\u2019t seen that historically and your guidance imply sequential ramp up throughout the year. I guess, maybe just talk about the visibility you have. I know you made some comments around backlog being twice as high. So talk about the visibility you have. I know you made some comments around backlog being twice as high. So talk about the visibility into the guided efferent. I think on the $70 million to $90 million for GRAIL, is that the gross contribution? Is there some intercompany elimination in that number? Or is that a net number? Is that a proxy for Galleri volumes? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. So let me actually take both questions. So, I\u2019ll take the first one on the guide. The visibility on the guide is good. I think we have a balanced guide and we\u2019re very confident about achieving the guide that we have. With regards to Q1, you are correct. We are entering the year with very strong momentum in Q1. I mean, the business is really \u2013 is very strong. We\u2019re seeing very strong momentum on clinical, with oncology testing, in genetic disease testing, in NIPT and our research markets are also robust. We have a very strong backlog, as we said, a record backlog, in fact, in terms of instruments. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the Q1 momentum. As we look forward towards the year, this is a year that\u2019s reflects a more, I would say, linearity that\u2019s more similar to \u2013 prior to the pandemic, where we see a ramp or an increase in terms of sequential revenues throughout the year. There are a few things that we\u2019ve considered in the guide that have been reflected in that 14% to 16%, Vijay, that we have factored in, that we believe also derisks the guide. So, let me mention a couple of those. For instance, one is with regards to COVID surveillance. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re assuming $130 million to $150 million in terms of COVID surveillance revenues. That\u2019s a step down from last year. It\u2019s at the midpoint, approximately $80 million of a step down. We\u2019ve also reflected a step down in terms of population genomics, driven by the termination of the UK Biobank, the finishing and the wrap-up of the UK Biobank. So that\u2019s a step down in terms of population genomics revenues year-over-year. And NovaSeq is showing very, very strong pull-through. As we said, in 2021, we exceeded $1.3 million per instrument, and we\u2019re reflecting a pull-through guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.3 million to make sure that we factor in the significant instruments that are coming into the installed base that will take some time to ramp up to those levels of pull-through that we\u2019re seeing across \u2013 that we saw across the average in 2021. So in general, very confident about the guide, good visibility. But the backdrop to all of this is still a pandemic year here in year three, and the uncertainty that goes with that.  With regards to GRAIL, the $70 million to $90 million, that\u2019s end GRAIL sales to their customers. So, we do have intercompany elimination of revenues that impact our total consolidated Illumina revenues. But the $70 million to $90 million is the total end GRAIL sales to their customers. That\u2019s not impacted by intercompany. The sales from us to GRAIL show up on the core business, and then they\u2019re eliminated in the total consolidated view.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik your line is open. You can go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. So two related questions. One, on the new platform you\u2019re alluding to, are you going to take a HiSeq X approach and basically segment this and make for like whole human genome or single cell applications? Or are you going to make it broadly accessible? And then a follow on that is I can certainly see elasticity of demand in the research market. I mean, that clearly has been proven out. But what are your assumptions for the clinical market as you lower price? What are your sort of like volume assumptions? I mean, don\u2019t you have to keep clinical pricing sort of at a premium for a while longer before you can really sort of see the volumes in there to make it up? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Thanks, Derik. So let\u2019s take both. This new chemistry can be applied across the throughput spectrum. So all options at this point are on the table. There are options, like you said, where we could create an instrument that targets a, and catalyzes a segment of the market. So as you\u2019re alluding to, HiSeq X was extraordinarily successful at opening up the whole genome sequencing market, that before HiSeq X enabled a $1,000 price point, a very small part of the market was whole genomes. And after HiSeq X, you\u2019ve seen just an explosion in terms of the number of customers that could do whole genome sequencing and that did, in fact, do whole genome sequencing. And so one of the options on the table that Chemistry X would allow us to do is, again, look for opportunities like that to catalyze certain segments of the market. I mean you could imagine lots of parts of the markets that could be catalyzed. So for example, hypothetically, you could look at the single cell market. And we hear from lots and lots of customers that they would love, love to be able to do much, much, much larger experiments with using single cells. And so something like Chemistry X could enable that part of the market. We also hear from our customers that they would love to run much, much larger experiments, targeting, understanding the genomic drivers of neurological conditions, like autism and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. And so you can imagine that this could enable some of those kinds of experiments. In the \u2013 and so again, it depends on where we decide to use this chemistry, but the benefits it provides in terms of lower cost, but also a faster turnaround time because one of the other things you could get with this chemistry is you could see scenarios where you can have certain depths being returned to customers within a single shift. And that would be fundamentally enabling to some clinical applications. So even if you \u2013 the price was the same, just the ability to turn results around in a single eight-hour shift would open up potentially in some segments of the market. From our customer in terms of the price perspective, there are some parts of the clinical market where because we provide end-to-end solutions, we\u2019re already at the stage where the customers buy the product and it\u2019s priced in terms of a per report or a per sample fee. And those markets like NIPT, for example, or genetic disease diagnosis are already enabled at the price point they are. And so it\u2019s not necessary that the per sample price needs to change because reimbursement is already in place, allowing our lab customers to have a profitable business in those areas. But there are other clinical markets where the lower price point will be fundamentally enabling. And so that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re thinking about the options in front of us with Chemistry X. Hi, operator, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Kyle Mikson of Canaccord. Kyle, your line is connected. You may proceed.\nKyle Mikson: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-part question. So most of these new kind of short route platforms are launching in the near term with like low-to-mid throughput capability, which is suitable for the clinical market like hospitals and clinical research. I'm just wondering if that's going to be an early focus for you as maybe that will lead into any clinical market share or growth in the near to medium term that part of the market that's kind of underpenetrated right now. And then the second part of my question I want to ask was, I mean, Francis, you mentioned earlier the Biden administration launched the cancer Moonshot initiative. And it references multi-cancer early detection test, particularly involving studies or trials to accelerate development and market adoption of the said test. So I'd just like to understand your level of confidence that the initiative is going to move the needle for the MSAID industry overall. And importantly, could it improve the domestic or global perception of the merger, specifically with obviously, and potentially have any downstream impact on the ongoing trials or reviews. Thanks. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: One moment, while we reconnect our speakers. Kyle pardon that interruption, but could you repeat your question now that the speakers are connected?\nKyle Mikson: Sure, can you hear me?\nOperator: We can.\nFrancis deSouza: We can.\nKyle Mikson: Perfect. Okay. So the two-part question. The first of which was most of these kind of competing new short-route platforms that are launching in the near term or low to mid throughput, which is suitable for the clinical market. That's going to be an early focus for these emerging companies. I'm just wondering if you think that's going to eat into any of your clinical market share or growth in the near to medium term given the area is still pretty underpenetrated? And then the second question I had was about GRAIL, the cancer Moonshot initiative that the Biden administration have announced recently, mentioned multi-cancer related action tests. I just want to understand if you think the industry is going to move the needle for the MSAID industry overall? And could it improve the domestic or the global perception of the merger specifically and potentially have any downstream impact on the ongoing trials or reviews?\nFrancis deSouza: All right. So we'll take both. The first question is around entrance in the low- to mid-throughput market and how we expect that to play out. Let me jump there first. I'll say, obviously, we have terrific products in that part of the market. And we just, in the last couple of years, launched the NextSeq 1000, 2000 that are squarely targeted in that space. And we think they are especially well suited for the clinical markets because you have the \u2013 from a clear perspective, the MiSeq Dx, the NextSeqDx, that are workhorse is already in the clinical market. And then you have the terrific price performance that you get out of the NextSeq 1000, 2000.  Those instruments NextSeq 1000, 2000 represent the most powerful mid-throughput products on the market, even including some of the entrants that are coming in. And I think that will continue to provide very compelling value to our customers going forward. The other interesting dynamic, though, that we're seeing playing out in the market is more and more of the new customers coming in \u2013 are coming in at higher ends of the portfolio than we've seen historically. And so what's playing out in the market is that the applications that are emerging for sequencing are more data intensive and sequencing intensive. They are high intensity applications that are just demanding more sequencing and more performance power. And so what that means is, I think, and we saw this play out in the computer with the PC market, we saw this play out with iPhones that the devices just need to be more and more powerful. In fact, as somebody who\u2019s telling you that if NovaSeq is the new MiSeq. And I think that\u2019s sort of the ethos we\u2019re seeing in the market that there is this insatiable demand for more power, and what we consider today, if you\u2019re targeting what\u2019s the low- and mid-throughput today, you better show up with a lot of power. Because today, the future low and mid will look a lot more like today\u2019s high throughput market. In terms of GRAIL and the Cancer Moonshot, it\u2019s obviously great to have an increased national focus on cancer and bending the mortality curve for cancer. So that\u2019s terrific to see. It\u2019s especially exciting to see a recognition that early detection of cancer. And specifically, early detection of multiple cancer simultaneously, a simple test, are an important thrust in terms of this fight against cancer. And so just the attention being put on this space, I think, is great to see. We\u2019re going to watch to see how that plays out in terms of additional funding or accelerated regulatory review or reimbursement. But we feel it\u2019s all very helpful in terms of accelerating that market. It\u2019s obviously especially helpful for GRAIL, because GRAIL is the only product in the market today that can detect 50 cancers and identify tissue of origin. So that\u2019s obviously really exciting from a GRAIL perspective.\nOperator: Okay. We will proceed in our questions. Our next question is from Sung Ji Nam of BTIG. Sung Ji your line is connected. Please proceed.\nSung Ji Nam: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the GRAIL multi-cancer MRD test that you\u2019re expected to launch next year. I was wondering if you might be able to comment on the performance characteristics against some of the single-cancer MRD tests that are available in the market today. And then could we expect potential interim data readouts throughout this year?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So the ultimate performance characteristics will be announced as the product gets launched, of course. But given the approach that GRAIL is taking, here are some of the things that we know already and some of the things that you can watch for. One is because it\u2019s leveraging the same underlying technology as the Galleri test. This is a test that will be able to detect the recurrence of multiple types of cancer, not just a single cancer. And so that\u2019s really helpful because sometimes the cancer that emerges may not be the exact same cancer as a patient had before. And so GRAIL\u2019s approach will be able to detect that. Also, because you are not depending on a tissue biopsy first to create the test for a patient, you should also be able to get the test into the patient\u2019s hands much faster than you would with approach that required a tissue biopsy. So another key metric to watch, which is very, very important for some patients, is how quickly a patient can get that test and have it ready for the patient. So the GRAIL approach is just, conceptually, is much faster from that perspective. And so that\u2019s another key metric to watch for. And then in terms of the performance of the Galleri test, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for early detection is really strong. It has an extraordinarily low false-positive rate. And since the MRD test is going to be leveraging the same technology, that\u2019s something to watch for, too, that they\u2019re bringing a lot of expertise around delivering this the screening test with high positive predictive value into the MRD market.\nOperator: Sung Ji, does this answer your question?\nSung Ji Nam: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Sung Ji. Our next question is from Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Puneet your line is connected. Please proceed.\nPuneet Souda: Thanks. Hi, Francis and Sam. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll just ask two in one. First one is, I know you\u2019ve asked quite a bit about Chemistry X already, but I just want to clarify that the benefit of the Chemistry X is equal across all applications, from genome to exome to routine RNA seq to single cells. I just want to make sure. And then does it get to closer to $100 genome or $100 genome more meaningfully lower versus what a genome price is today? And lastly, if I could just want to clarify on the 10-kilo base reads that you\u2019re getting with Infinity, is that core technology still SBS? That\u2019s my understanding. And so at the end of the day, does this \u2013 is this on the lower end of the long-read sequencing read lenses that are being produced by native long reads? So this is being viewed as a synthetic? So I just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that correctly. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me take, Puneet your questions in order. First, Chemistry X. Is it specific to an application or does it work across all applications? So the answer is it works across all applications. This is a chemistry that is not tied to a specific application. So you should \u2013 you will get the benefits of this chemistry across any application you run on a sequencer that uses this chemistry. It absolutely is a big step forward in terms of price reduction. And so depending on the form factor, depending on the instrument we put out, it will be able to deliver a lower cost in that part of the market. And so again, it's one component. As you know, chemistry is one part of it, but it's a part that's going to give us a big step forward whatever form factor we choose to release this chemistry and whatever instrument type. In terms of Infinity, it is SBS, and one of the things we've heard loudly from customers is that they want a single platform that can scale up and down read lengths. What they don't want in their labs is multiple different technologies that have multiple different upfront workflows that requires them to train techs differently that have multiple input DNA requirements. And so big, big requirement in this market is going to be can you have a single chemistry, a single sort of platform that scales up and down, and that's what Infinity delivers. It's on SBS. And so it gives you all the things that you already know and are familiar with, with SBS. And so for our 8,000 customers and our 20,000 instruments in the field, that's really great news. In terms of the 10 kb, it's absolutely not a loan to be honest, it's exactly where some of the other long lead players are in the market. Now there are some that can go bigger than that, but that's not where the majority of the market is.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Puneet. Our next question is from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas, your line is connected. Please proceed with your question.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Good evening. A two-parter for you, Francis. Just a point of clarification first in Chemistry X, I think I heard you mention earlier that you might bring it to some parts of the existing portfolio as well. So just a bit of finer point on that. Does this mean that it could be backwards compatible at least selectively? And then second one on the GRAIL guide here. Is it fair to assume sort of 85,000 tests at the midpoint using that sort of $950 list price? Or are you assuming a lower effective ASP in your guidance assumptions?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So, thank you for that. Let me take the first question. What I've said is we will be using Chemistry X for all new platforms going forward. But to your point, there's no technical reason why selectively we couldn't bring Chemistry X to parts of the current portfolio. We don't have plans that we've announced around that at all, but technically speaking that it's absolutely backwards compatible for some parts of our portfolio. And then the GRAIL...\nSam Samad: Let me take that one, Francis. So with regards to GRAIL, Tejas, and thanks for the question, by the way. No, I would not assume that actually. The price is as you said, at approximately $950 range. But I would not assume that, that price is uniform across the full guide or the total revenue guide because there could be different pricing assumptions depending on the collaborations, the partnerships that they have. So I would not make that assumption around the test volume.\nFrancis deSouza: Tejas, does this answers your question?\nTejas Savant: Yes. I'm good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick, your line is connected. Please proceed.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. It might be one for you, Sam. Just in terms of the backlog, obviously encouraging to hear it's almost double what it was coming in last year. Can you just talk about how much of that is just a natural organic build as the numbers get bigger versus any supply chain issues, I'm sure that was a big topic a quarter ago? Do you feel like you're mostly past kind of the worst part, and what's the expectations there for the next couple of quarters? Have things normalized a bit for you?\nSam Samad: Yes. I think the simple answer, Patrick, and thanks for the question, is really its organic build. It's the strength of the business. It's the strength in terms of demand that we're seeing in clinical and the applications across clinical and research to some extent. And some of that backlog is instruments. Some of it is consumables. So it's \u2013 it reflects the broad base of our business. In terms of supply chain, to address your question, I mean, as we talked about last quarter, obviously supply chain is more complicated these days with pandemic, with COVID. But we have taken a lot of steps and done a lot of initiatives to help preserve the continuity of the supply chain, to make sure our customers have uninterrupted access to product. So we have not seen really disruption in supply chain, given some of these actions aside from very isolated cases that we see traditionally, but nothing unusual in terms of disruptions to supply chain. We've made sure that we've increased the amount of distribution center capacity that we have, we've increased safety stock on consumables. We've taken a lot of steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain continues and that we can provide product to customers. So I just want to make sure that's clear.\nOperator: Thank you, Patrick. Our next question is from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Luke, please proceed.\nLuke Sergott: Great. Thanks for the questions. So can you give us an update on the EC deadline suspension and ultimately what that means? And then as you guys kind of walk through the timelines in the appeals process, just give us an idea of the, of how you could see that playing out if things don't go your way and then you appeal? And then again, just from a timing perspective. And then lastly, I just wanted to get a idea of the margin characteristics here throughout the year and the guidance and really how we should be thinking about the pacing there?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So I'll take the first question, which is around timing of the various regulatory processes underway. So first, in terms of our Phase II review with the European Commission, we are currently in the phase where we are in discussions around potential remedies that could work for this deal. And so the pause we're in right now gives both of us, both sides, times to sort of work through that and discuss potential remedies together. And so what that means is it pushes the time line out a little bit. Initially, the time line was that we expected to get to a decision by the end of March. It's now looking like that decision is a Q2 decision. There's separately in other processes going on in Europe around case in Luxembourg looking at the jurisdictional issues associated here. And that's a decision that's also likely in sort of the Q2-ish time frame. And so we'll be watching for that. The hearing happened in Q4, and we're waiting for a decision in that time frame. That's the time frame associated with the processes in Europe. If either of them go our way where, we are done and we can start \u2013 we're done to the European part of the process, and we can start integrating. If the review doesn't go our way, there's still an appeal process that we could look at after that decision happen.\nSam Samad: Yes. And Luke, with regards to the margin evolution throughout the year, I mean, we'll provide more updates on that as we go forward. We give you an update with regards to Q1 and what our guidance is for Q1 in terms of operating margins. We mentioned that Q1 is going to be a 300 basis point improvement from Q4 sequentially across consolidated Illumina, and we said that core Illumina in Q1 would be approximately 28%. Now going forward, we don't usually provide quarterly margin sort of comments, but we'll provide more updates as the year \u2013 as we go deeper into the year.\nLuke Sergott: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Luke. Our next question is from John Sourbeer of UBS. John, please proceed.\nJohn Sourbeer: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I think in your presentation last month, you said around 40% mid-throughput customers are currently in clinical, and I believe, around similar for the low throughput. Any thoughts on what the outlook is for 2022 on these? And what is the time line it takes to get to 50-50 there?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So I think \u2013 and I'll start. We have continue to see the percentage of our business target into clinical continue to grow. So if you look at our overall sequencing consumable revenue, you've seen that sort of steadily grow from the late 40s towards the mid-40s now, and that's continuing to grow. And if you look at how last year played out, we continue to see the clinical segments grow faster than the research segment. And so those lines are steadily going in one direction only.  In fact, last year, the largest single segment that we target became oncology testing, the clinical segment. And that's likely to continue to be our largest segment for a long time. So that's overtaken genetic disease research, which, for a very long time, as you know, was our largest segment. And so we don't have a specific time frame around when it crosses 50%, but it's definitely heading in that direction.\nSam Samad: Yes, there is one other dynamic, John, that I would add [Technical Difficulty] of total Illumina revenues. But if you look over the last, I mean, to Francis' comments, if you look over the last three years, the growth of clinical has exceeded the growth of research. And that just reflects \u2013 at both markets are growing very robustly, but that just reflects the fact that clinical markets with regards to oncology testing, genetic disease testing, NIPT have been growing really, really at an impressive clip.\nJohn Sourbeer: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nSam Samad: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you, John. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll hand the conference back over to Salli Schwartz for any closing remarks.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call, and we look forward to our next update following the close of the first fiscal quarter of 2022.\nOperator: This concludes the Illumina Q4 2021 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to share with you how our commitment to innovation is driving growth and unlocking the power of the genome. My comments will cover a few key areas, starting with our strong finish and exceptional results for 2021, followed by how our platforms and markets drove those results. I'll then conclude by highlighting a few of the many trends that will support our momentum and continued growth in 2022 and beyond. Let's start with our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Fourth quarter revenue of approximately $1.2 billion increased 26% year-over-year, with strong growth across both instruments and consumables and across all regions. Full year 2021 revenue of more than $4.5 billion, increased 40% year-over-year, reflecting 76% growth in sequencing instruments and 43% growth in sequencing consumables. We're seeing record demand for our instruments across the throughput spectrum and across geographies. In 2021, we shipped more than 3,200 sequencing instruments and added more than 930 new instrument customers, over 50% more than in 2020 or 2019. Delving now into each of our platforms, starting with high throughput. We shipped 384 NovaSeq units in 2021, with more than one-third of those instruments for oncology testing. Approximately 50% of NovaSeq orders in 2021 were to new to high throughput or new to Illumina customers. 2021 NovaSeq consumable pull-through of more than $1.3 million per instrument was the highest ever average even with over double the placement compared to last year. Moving to mid-throughput. In 2021, we shipped more than 1,100 NextSeq systems, surpassing 1,000 for the first time and nearly doubling 2020 shipments. This volume was driven by growing NextSeq 550 demand in clinical applications like oncology testing and reproductive health, as well as NextSeq 1000 and 2000 demand as customers expand into multi-omic application. More than 20% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 units this year were placed with new to Illumina customers as we continue to see new customers using higher throughput applications. For low throughput, in 2021, we shipped more than 1,600 units, another record, driven in part by the addition of more than 700 new customers. Looking at our continued strong growth through the lens of our market, our clinical markets currently include testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. In 2021, our consumable shipments to clinical markets grew 42%, driven in particular by oncology testing, where many customers are building out comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, and expanding into liquid biopsy and monitoring. We continue to see expanding opportunities for our oncology products globally, including new studies launching in Europe and Asia, with our research-use only TruSight Oncology 500 assay. For example, our recent joint research project with the National Cancer Center Japan will develop personalized cancer treatments for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a cancer that occurs more frequently in Asia. And our partnership with the Jean Perrin Center at the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital in France, will assess the clinical value of CGP in patients with late-stage disease compared to the current standard of care. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to see strong momentum. GRAIL launched the Galleri test last year as the first clinically validated, multi-cancer early detection test to be available to patients and providers. Galleri can detect more than 50 types of cancer, most of which have no current screening. It's great to see the initial market reception with multiple large employers and payers adopting Galleri and more than 1,500 prescribing partners, including participation from leading health systems like the NHS, the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. The team continues to collaborate with pharmaceutical partners like AstraZeneca, Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb on potential new innovations in the post diagnostic space. Finally, the recent initiatives launched in the U.S. and EU to beat cancer are very encouraging. The U.S.' Cancer Moonshot National Initiative and Europe's Beating Cancer Plan highlight the increasing recognition of early detection as a critical component in the fight against cancer. Illumina is deeply committed to supporting all early detection, oncology testing and treatment initiatives to improve care and save lives. Beyond oncology, reproductive health also had a strong year in 2021. This was driven in part by revised American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, guidelines enabling genetic testing coverage for all U.S. pregnancies, as well as increasing adoption of our VeriSeq NIPT V2 product globally. Our third clinical market, genetic disease testing, saw tremendous growth and additional evidence generation in 2021. With significant publications in both the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Pediatrics affirming the clinical utility of whole genome sequencing, or WGS, for critically ill children. In 2022, we're already seeing an increase in coverage with California, Oregon and Maryland Medicaid initiating coverage for WGS in the NICU setting. Expansion of programs for WGS and NICU settings are also occurring globally, including our recent project with Germany's Hannover Medical School to implement the use of WGS in NICU patients. This program contributes to a growing body of evidence from other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia as well as in states across the U.S., showing that WGS offers significant benefits for diagnosis of genetic disease in critically ill infants, along with cost efficiencies for health systems. Turning to our research and applied markets, consumables grew 43% in 2021, driven by projects like All of Us, along with ongoing COVID surveillance efforts, that contributed approximately $220 million in total revenue. I'd now like to spend a few minutes on three key trends that will drive long-term growth. First, is the continued deepening and expansion of Illumina's addressable markets. We're seeing further penetration of our existing markets through increased access and adoption. The use of sequencing is proliferating globally across applications, and new initiatives continue to integrate genomics into national health care systems. Our technology and genomics expertise are enabling programs like Our Future Health, the UK's largest-ever health research program that will deliver genetic analysis of DNA samples from up to five million volunteers. This data will be used for a variety of potential discoveries, including new signals to detect diseases earlier, new ways to better predict high-risk population for diseases and new personalized therapies or tools to delay diseases or change the course of their progression. We're excited to play a role in this project as the genotyping partner for the program. We also continue to support a growing global COVID surveillance network that will extend to broader pan pathogen and genomic epidemiology work. This infrastructure is already being used to study other infectious diseases. For example, in South Africa, Dr. Tulio de Oliveira's team at CERI, the Center for Epidemic Response and Innovation, is using their fleet of sequencers to study other communicable diseases like HIV and malaria. We expect additional opportunities for epidemiology applications in the future as global funding for pathogen surveillance and research expand. And new sequencing applications and opportunities are growing and evolving rapidly, including in multiple nascent spaces like multi-omics and drug development. We're supporting the spectrum of multi-omic applications across our instruments, including proteomics, where our co-development partnership with SomaLogic is off to a strong start. We're also catalyzing growth in drug discovery, where genomic-based methods can dramatically improve speed to market, success rates and costs. In addition to our partnership with Nashville Biosciences, we're collaborating with the Montreal Neurological Institute Hospital, Takeda and Roche to enable large-scale analysis of patient data and identify promising targets for drug development in neurological diseases. Programs like Our Future Health, growing applications and increasing global access will support long-term adoption of NGS. The new markets we're opening like drug discovery will further enable adoption, while also improving data equity and the integration of genomics into health care. We're experiencing this increasing demand for genomics as we enter 2022, with our instrument backlog almost twice the size it was entering 2021. A second trend is the multifaceted growth in our customer base. Our existing customers are growing their instrument fleet. We're also seeing increasing numbers of customers new to Illumina. As a result, our installed base has grown to more than 20,000 instruments at the end of 2021. The third trend is the demand for even greater data generation. In 2021, an average Illumina high-throughput customer generated approximately 4x more data than in 2017. This will continue as customers need more complete genomic information and as NGS becomes standard in clinical setting. These shifts will increase the number of projects, number of samples per project and the depth of sequencing for sample as multiple tests are run per patient and samples are used for rigs across high-intensity applications like multi-omic. This demand for higher throughput sequencing will, in turn, continue to drive further growth in our sequencing consumables revenue. For 2021, between our consumables and services, more than 80% of our revenue is recurring in nature. This more predictable and profitable revenue stream provides a tremendous base to invest into the business and drive future growth. Illumina's 2021 performance and significant momentum entering 2022 demonstrate our strong position to support our customers and partners as these trends accelerate genomics in health care. I'll now turn the call over to Sam to highlight additional details on our results and operations, as well as discuss our guidance for 2022. Sam? Thanks, Sam. To close, I'd like to thank our teams, our network of partners and the extraordinary scientists and clinicians we serve. I am incredibly excited for the many opportunities ahead. Today, more than 1 billion people are covered for genomic testing globally, and we expect this number to double within 5 years as genomics accelerates the adoption and potential of personalized medicine. Illumina will continue to support the growing number of patients around the world, accessing the life-saving benefits of genomics from oncology therapy selection, to reproductive health, genetic disease testing and pathogen surveillance. We will also continue to push genomics to new frontiers like drug development and proteomics. Additionally, we will enable discovery across these existing and new markets with a pipeline of innovative products and solutions developed in collaboration with our customers. It has been fantastic to see the strong interest and excitement across our customer base for our latest developments, including our breakthrough Chemistry X and our Infinity long-read technology. We expect to not only directly address unmet market needs, but also revolutionized with scientists and clinicians connect spectrum sequencing. Together, we're enabling genomic-based discoveries that can transform health care and ultimately provide a brighter future for human health. I'll now invite the operator to open for Q&A. Operator? Yes. Thanks, Dan. And it has been fantastic, as I said, to see the reaction of our customers to both Chemistry X and the data we've provided so far on Infinity. So let me go through each of them a little bit. With Chemistry X, we've been keeping all of you in the loop over the years as we moved from the research phase then into product development and shared some of the early data, maybe just over a year ago. And then as I said a couple of weeks ago, we're now moving Chemistry X from product development into manufacturing with the whole new manufacturing facility and sort of scaling up production. And so it's been terrific to see the progress and the innovations that are in Chemistry X. As I said, this is a from the ground-up rethink of our chemistry, probably the single biggest advance in our chemistry since Solexa was created all those years ago. What this means for our customers and in terms of the industry is we can expect a step change in terms of the speed of the chemistry, and that will translate into much faster turnaround times for the tests that our customers are running. And that's especially relevant for, not just very large-scale research projects, but especially in clinical settings where you do want to get some of those results to patients more quickly. It means higher accuracy and all of that combines to also enable a really exciting road map in terms of price per G. And we've talked about the fact that we continue to be committed to really driving down the cost of sequencing, to make it more accessible in Chemistry X, a fundamental part of that. And so we're now entering manufacturing, and we're closer to bringing that out into products than we've ever been. I've talked about the fact that this is going to be foundational to all new products coming out. And there's no reason, as we look at our existing portfolio why it may not make sense in some parts of our portfolio to have it in there as well. In terms of Infinity, the excitement there is because we've sort of rethought how people think about long reads and short reads. And again, went back to first principles to say, what customers don't want is they don't want two different platforms, one for short read and one for long read. And what they're telling you is that they want to take some of the best elements of what we've got in SBS, high accuracy, low cost, low input requirements and apply that to all reads. And so when we looked at how we would rethink long reads, we brought some of the best of those elements and to say low input requirements, lower cost, maintain high accuracy. And they also want it to be a single molecule approach. They didn't want it to be a composite of multiple molecules. And so the team has done a fantastic job innovating to deliver that in terms of our Infinity technology. You've seen some data from some of our customers. We've talked about the fact that we're bringing it to market later this year, and you'll continue to see more data and more information from us. Yes. So let's talk about Chemistry X and what that means in terms of our customers and how do we avoid, as you said, freezing the market potentially. One of the exciting things we hear from our customers about being with Illumina is that you're part of this exciting roadmap, and that you're not only getting access to what we provide today, but you know that we are going to continue to innovate and bring new products out. And so for our customers, it's been exciting to watch this journey of Chemistry X develop, and we've been, I think, good about sharing the data through this whole process. So they know what's coming. They can get a sense for what it can mean for them. We don't have a new product announced, so there's nothing to freeze the market for. And our customers also know that they've done this with us several times that whenever we introduce a new product, we do have programs in place that involve trade-ins or if you've already placed an order and it's in our backlog, you can switch that if you wanted the new instrument. And so over the years, we've developed a number of pretty robust programs around enabling a seamless upgrade for our customers. Now also, the other thing we've learned is, especially in the clinical markets, that when a new instrument comes out, typically, some of our customers will buy one of the new instruments, for example, and use that to develop their new workflows, to get familiar with the new instruments and then plan an upgrade over a multiyear period. And so that could still play out. But as we introduce a new instrument in the future, they may buy one to sort of get comfortable with it, and then use that to plan and upgrade over a multiyear period. And then in terms of GRAIL, the momentum we're seeing with GRAIL has been terrific to watch. They are seeing traction, as we said, with employers. And what's been interesting there is we expected traction with financial services companies, with tech companies, some other companies that traditionally are more forward-leaning in terms of using benefits as a way to attract talent. What we are really excited about is that we're seeing customers across industries. We've seen, as we said, large logistics players and transport players that are signed up to offer this benefit to their employees. And so that's been exciting to see. We're also really pleased with the number of prescribing providers that have now got experience with the Galleri tests. So we said there are over 1,500 prescribing providers that ordered the test in 2021 last year going into this year. And so that's a great base of health care professionals that have some experience now with Galleri and should be more comfortable ordering it going forward. In terms of the guidance, most of the guide for Galleri \u2013 for GRAIL this year is Galleri. There is a component of it associated with MRD, but it is a smaller percentage. Now as we look at that number, that could be a potential area for upside, and we'll keep watching the traction they are making in that space. Yes. So let me start with Chemistry X and what it could mean. We know, just apples-to-apples, Chemistry 1 versus Chemistry X that you will get significant cost reductions as you [Technical Difficulty] yet. Now ultimately, that looks like depends on everything else we think [Technical Difficulty] so ultimately, [Technical Difficulty] cost per key will be partially chemistry. So we have to look at optics [Technical Difficulty] all of that. It's a little early to stay with the specific impact. It depends on [Technical Difficulty] depends on the entire oncology [Technical Difficulty] were specific about what that give you specifics [Technical Difficulty] the price. But we will be very confident that a giant part [Technical Difficulty] cost reduction with chemistry. [Technical Difficulty] And this have a specific additional detail [Technical Difficulty] Nashville as that comes to get [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Let me \u2013 just the summary I'll say on Chemistry X is it gives us a big step forward in terms of delivering price reductions, in terms of sequencing for our customers. But ultimately, the specific number will depend on the type of instrument we build it into, as well as the other components with the technology ecosystem that we built into that instrument. The data path, the optics and so on. And so stay tuned as we get more specific, we will share that with you. Great. Thanks, Derik. So let's take both. This new chemistry can be applied across the throughput spectrum. So all options at this point are on the table. There are options, like you said, where we could create an instrument that targets a, and catalyzes a segment of the market. So as you're alluding to, HiSeq X was extraordinarily successful at opening up the whole genome sequencing market, that before HiSeq X enabled a $1,000 price point, a very small part of the market was whole genomes. And after HiSeq X, you've seen just an explosion in terms of the number of customers that could do whole genome sequencing and that did, in fact, do whole genome sequencing. And so one of the options on the table that Chemistry X would allow us to do is, again, look for opportunities like that to catalyze certain segments of the market. I mean you could imagine lots of parts of the markets that could be catalyzed. So for example, hypothetically, you could look at the single cell market. And we hear from lots and lots of customers that they would love, love to be able to do much, much, much larger experiments with using single cells. And so something like Chemistry X could enable that part of the market. We also hear from our customers that they would love to run much, much larger experiments, targeting, understanding the genomic drivers of neurological conditions, like autism and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. And so you can imagine that this could enable some of those kinds of experiments. In the \u2013 and so again, it depends on where we decide to use this chemistry, but the benefits it provides in terms of lower cost, but also a faster turnaround time because one of the other things you could get with this chemistry is you could see scenarios where you can have certain depths being returned to customers within a single shift. And that would be fundamentally enabling to some clinical applications. So even if you \u2013 the price was the same, just the ability to turn results around in a single eight-hour shift would open up potentially in some segments of the market. From our customer in terms of the price perspective, there are some parts of the clinical market where because we provide end-to-end solutions, we're already at the stage where the customers buy the product and it's priced in terms of a per report or a per sample fee. And those markets like NIPT, for example, or genetic disease diagnosis are already enabled at the price point they are. And so it's not necessary that the per sample price needs to change because reimbursement is already in place, allowing our lab customers to have a profitable business in those areas. But there are other clinical markets where the lower price point will be fundamentally enabling. And so that's sort of how we're thinking about the options in front of us with Chemistry X. Hi, operator, we're ready for the next question. We can. All right. So we'll take both. The first question is around entrance in the low- to mid-throughput market and how we expect that to play out. Let me jump there first. I'll say, obviously, we have terrific products in that part of the market. And we just, in the last couple of years, launched the NextSeq 1000, 2000 that are squarely targeted in that space. And we think they are especially well suited for the clinical markets because you have the \u2013 from a clear perspective, the MiSeq Dx, the NextSeqDx, that are workhorse is already in the clinical market. And then you have the terrific price performance that you get out of the NextSeq 1000, 2000.  Those instruments NextSeq 1000, 2000 represent the most powerful mid-throughput products on the market, even including some of the entrants that are coming in. And I think that will continue to provide very compelling value to our customers going forward. The other interesting dynamic, though, that we're seeing playing out in the market is more and more of the new customers coming in \u2013 are coming in at higher ends of the portfolio than we've seen historically. And so what's playing out in the market is that the applications that are emerging for sequencing are more data intensive and sequencing intensive. They are high intensity applications that are just demanding more sequencing and more performance power. And so what that means is, I think, and we saw this play out in the computer with the PC market, we saw this play out with iPhones that the devices just need to be more and more powerful. In fact, as somebody who's telling you that if NovaSeq is the new MiSeq. And I think that's sort of the ethos we're seeing in the market that there is this insatiable demand for more power, and what we consider today, if you're targeting what's the low- and mid-throughput today, you better show up with a lot of power. Because today, the future low and mid will look a lot more like today's high throughput market. In terms of GRAIL and the Cancer Moonshot, it's obviously great to have an increased national focus on cancer and bending the mortality curve for cancer. So that's terrific to see. It's especially exciting to see a recognition that early detection of cancer. And specifically, early detection of multiple cancer simultaneously, a simple test, are an important thrust in terms of this fight against cancer. And so just the attention being put on this space, I think, is great to see. We're going to watch to see how that plays out in terms of additional funding or accelerated regulatory review or reimbursement. But we feel it's all very helpful in terms of accelerating that market. It's obviously especially helpful for GRAIL, because GRAIL is the only product in the market today that can detect 50 cancers and identify tissue of origin. So that's obviously really exciting from a GRAIL perspective. Yes. So the ultimate performance characteristics will be announced as the product gets launched, of course. But given the approach that GRAIL is taking, here are some of the things that we know already and some of the things that you can watch for. One is because it's leveraging the same underlying technology as the Galleri test. This is a test that will be able to detect the recurrence of multiple types of cancer, not just a single cancer. And so that's really helpful because sometimes the cancer that emerges may not be the exact same cancer as a patient had before. And so GRAIL's approach will be able to detect that. Also, because you are not depending on a tissue biopsy first to create the test for a patient, you should also be able to get the test into the patient's hands much faster than you would with approach that required a tissue biopsy. So another key metric to watch, which is very, very important for some patients, is how quickly a patient can get that test and have it ready for the patient. So the GRAIL approach is just, conceptually, is much faster from that perspective. And so that's another key metric to watch for. And then in terms of the performance of the Galleri test, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for early detection is really strong. It has an extraordinarily low false-positive rate. And since the MRD test is going to be leveraging the same technology, that's something to watch for, too, that they're bringing a lot of expertise around delivering this the screening test with high positive predictive value into the MRD market. Yes. So let me take, Puneet your questions in order. First, Chemistry X. Is it specific to an application or does it work across all applications? So the answer is it works across all applications. This is a chemistry that is not tied to a specific application. So you should \u2013 you will get the benefits of this chemistry across any application you run on a sequencer that uses this chemistry. It absolutely is a big step forward in terms of price reduction. And so depending on the form factor, depending on the instrument we put out, it will be able to deliver a lower cost in that part of the market. And so again, it's one component. As you know, chemistry is one part of it, but it's a part that's going to give us a big step forward whatever form factor we choose to release this chemistry and whatever instrument type. In terms of Infinity, it is SBS, and one of the things we've heard loudly from customers is that they want a single platform that can scale up and down read lengths. What they don't want in their labs is multiple different technologies that have multiple different upfront workflows that requires them to train techs differently that have multiple input DNA requirements. And so big, big requirement in this market is going to be can you have a single chemistry, a single sort of platform that scales up and down, and that's what Infinity delivers. It's on SBS. And so it gives you all the things that you already know and are familiar with, with SBS. And so for our 8,000 customers and our 20,000 instruments in the field, that's really great news. In terms of the 10 kb, it's absolutely not a loan to be honest, it's exactly where some of the other long lead players are in the market. Now there are some that can go bigger than that, but that's not where the majority of the market is. Yes. So, thank you for that. Let me take the first question. What I've said is we will be using Chemistry X for all new platforms going forward. But to your point, there's no technical reason why selectively we couldn't bring Chemistry X to parts of the current portfolio. We don't have plans that we've announced around that at all, but technically speaking that it's absolutely backwards compatible for some parts of our portfolio. And then the GRAIL... Tejas, does this answers your question? Yes. So I'll take the first question, which is around timing of the various regulatory processes underway. So first, in terms of our Phase II review with the European Commission, we are currently in the phase where we are in discussions around potential remedies that could work for this deal. And so the pause we're in right now gives both of us, both sides, times to sort of work through that and discuss potential remedies together. And so what that means is it pushes the time line out a little bit. Initially, the time line was that we expected to get to a decision by the end of March. It's now looking like that decision is a Q2 decision. There's separately in other processes going on in Europe around case in Luxembourg looking at the jurisdictional issues associated here. And that's a decision that's also likely in sort of the Q2-ish time frame. And so we'll be watching for that. The hearing happened in Q4, and we're waiting for a decision in that time frame. That's the time frame associated with the processes in Europe. If either of them go our way where, we are done and we can start \u2013 we're done to the European part of the process, and we can start integrating. If the review doesn't go our way, there's still an appeal process that we could look at after that decision happen. Yes. So I think \u2013 and I'll start. We have continue to see the percentage of our business target into clinical continue to grow. So if you look at our overall sequencing consumable revenue, you've seen that sort of steadily grow from the late 40s towards the mid-40s now, and that's continuing to grow. And if you look at how last year played out, we continue to see the clinical segments grow faster than the research segment. And so those lines are steadily going in one direction only.  In fact, last year, the largest single segment that we target became oncology testing, the clinical segment. And that's likely to continue to be our largest segment for a long time. So that's overtaken genetic disease research, which, for a very long time, as you know, was our largest segment. And so we don't have a specific time frame around when it crosses 50%, but it's definitely heading in that direction."

            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our fourth quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and conclude with our outlook for 2022. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. Our record fourth quarter revenue again exceeded our expectations due to continued strength in our core business, with consolidated revenue growing 26% year-over-year to $1.198 billion. For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $112 million or $0.71 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $117 million or $0.75 per diluted share, which included $0.66 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.09 of incremental dilution from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.6%, which decreased 280 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rate. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 157 million. Moving to segment results. I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $1.193 billion, driven by another quarter of record shipments for both clinical and research, with notable strength in oncology testing, genetic disease testing and population genomics. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 32% year-over-year to $792 million, driven by record NovaSeq consumables shipments resulting from the significant growth in installed base and strong pull-through that again exceeded our guidance range. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 35% year-over-year to $191 million, driven by record NovaSeq shipments due to continued new to high throughput customer adoption and accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1000, 2000 shipments also reached a new high in the quarter, and there was strong growth across all mid and low throughput systems year-over-year. We are entering 2022 with a strong sequencing instrument backlog that is almost double the backlog entering 2021. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance again exceeded our expectations, driven by the sustained focus on variant tracking due to the emergence of the Omicron variants. During the fourth quarter, COVID-19 surveillance contributed approximately $42 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $8 million in incremental instrument revenue. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $106 million was flat year-over-year as revenue growth from instrument service contracts and lab services was offset by lower IVD partnership revenue. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $619 million, growing 25% compared to the prior year period, driven by clinical demand in oncology testing, strength in genetic disease research for pharma and population genomics initiatives like All of Us, and COVID surveillance testing. EMEA delivered revenue of $350 million, representing 23% growth year-over-year, driven by strength in emerging markets, population genomics initiatives and COVID surveillance testing. Greater China revenue was $121 million, representing growth of 26% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region driven by the growing installed base in hospitals. Finally, APJ revenue of $103 million grew 34% year-over-year, driven by record NovaSeq placements and continued momentum in clinical markets, including genetic disease testing and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.6% increased 470 basis points year-over-year due primarily to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $580 million were up $141 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth, increased performance-based compensation expenses, higher onetime partnership-related expenses and increased project spend driven by investments we are making in R&D and operations to support the growth and scale of our business. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were higher than expected due to higher variable compensation expense and higher partnership expense compared to previous expectations. Core Illumina non-GAAP other expense of $8 million was $28 million lower than other income in Q4 2020 due to lower interest income on short-term investments liquidated to fund the GRAIL acquisition, as well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. Transitioning to the financial results of for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted of Galleri test fees and MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $131 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million. DSO was 49 days compared to 50 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. Fourth quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $70 million. And free cash flow was $212 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to grow 14% to 16% to approximately $5.16 billion to $5.25 billion. We expect full year 2022 Core Illumina revenue to grow 13% to 15% to approximately $5.11 billion to $5.2 billion. GRAIL expects its revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million for 2022, consisting primarily of Galleri test. For fiscal 2022, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 15% year-over-year, driven by accelerating demand in our base business. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument growth of approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in NovaSeq and NextSeq placements. We expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables growth of approximately 18% year-over-year, driven by our growing instrument installed base and strong utilization by our customers. We expect the strength to expand our platform, and we are raising our pull-through guidance for NovaSeq to a range of $1.2 million to $1.3 million per system for 2022. We expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000, 2000 in the range of $130,000 to $180,000 per system in 2022. And pull-through for NextSeq 550 in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 per system. For MiSeq, we expect pull-through in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 per system. And for MiniSeq, we expect pull-through in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 per system. We also expect revenue from COVID surveillance in the range of $130 million to $150 million in 2022. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 15.5% to 16%, and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% for 2022. We also expect the consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.20, which includes dilution from GRAIL of $3.75, including GRAIL operating loss dilution of approximately $3.25 and incremental dilution of approximately $0.50 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition in line with previous expectations. And finally, we expect diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 159 million shares. For the first quarter of 2022 for consolidated Illumina, we expect revenue to increase 10% to 12% year-over-year from the first quarter of 2021. This represents a sequential increase from the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting a strong start to the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase approximately 300 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses. We expect non-GAAP tax rate to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 19%. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares. For Core Illumina, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 28%. I'll now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. So maybe I can start, Tycho, this is Sam. Thanks for the question about the guidance on instruments, and I'll just provide a couple of brief comments. I mean, first of all, let me say, instruments in 2021 represented incredible performance. We're entering the year now in 2022 with a record backlog of instruments. So it gives us a lot of confidence about the guide, the 10%. As we think about some of the drivers behind this, continued very strong placements of NovaSeq, continued very strong placements on the mid-throughput side with NextSeq 2000, 1000. And we talked about in 2021 the record performance across those two platforms. Now there is a headwind, which is COVID surveillance. We placed quite a few instruments for COVID surveillance in 2021. And we don't expect, frankly, to place instruments for COVID surveillance in 2022. So that's a year-over-year headwind that's factored into the 10% growth in terms of the guide. For NovaSeq DX, that's a product that we're very excited to launch. It will be launched later this year. It does not represent the material impact in terms of growth for instruments in 2022. So Francis, maybe... Yes. Thanks, Vijay. So let me actually take both questions. So, I'll take the first one on the guide. The visibility on the guide is good. I think we have a balanced guide and we're very confident about achieving the guide that we have. With regards to Q1, you are correct. We are entering the year with very strong momentum in Q1. I mean, the business is really \u2013 is very strong. We're seeing very strong momentum on clinical, with oncology testing, in genetic disease testing, in NIPT and our research markets are also robust. We have a very strong backlog, as we said, a record backlog, in fact, in terms of instruments. So that's what's driving the Q1 momentum. As we look forward towards the year, this is a year that's reflects a more, I would say, linearity that's more similar to \u2013 prior to the pandemic, where we see a ramp or an increase in terms of sequential revenues throughout the year. There are a few things that we've considered in the guide that have been reflected in that 14% to 16%, Vijay, that we have factored in, that we believe also derisks the guide. So, let me mention a couple of those. For instance, one is with regards to COVID surveillance. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're assuming $130 million to $150 million in terms of COVID surveillance revenues. That's a step down from last year. It's at the midpoint, approximately $80 million of a step down. We've also reflected a step down in terms of population genomics, driven by the termination of the UK Biobank, the finishing and the wrap-up of the UK Biobank. So that's a step down in terms of population genomics revenues year-over-year. And NovaSeq is showing very, very strong pull-through. As we said, in 2021, we exceeded $1.3 million per instrument, and we're reflecting a pull-through guidance range of $1.2 million to $1.3 million to make sure that we factor in the significant instruments that are coming into the installed base that will take some time to ramp up to those levels of pull-through that we're seeing across \u2013 that we saw across the average in 2021. So in general, very confident about the guide, good visibility. But the backdrop to all of this is still a pandemic year here in year three, and the uncertainty that goes with that.  With regards to GRAIL, the $70 million to $90 million, that's end GRAIL sales to their customers. So, we do have intercompany elimination of revenues that impact our total consolidated Illumina revenues. But the $70 million to $90 million is the total end GRAIL sales to their customers. That's not impacted by intercompany. The sales from us to GRAIL show up on the core business, and then they're eliminated in the total consolidated view. Let me take that one, Francis. So with regards to GRAIL, Tejas, and thanks for the question, by the way. No, I would not assume that actually. The price is as you said, at approximately $950 range. But I would not assume that, that price is uniform across the full guide or the total revenue guide because there could be different pricing assumptions depending on the collaborations, the partnerships that they have. So I would not make that assumption around the test volume. Yes. I think the simple answer, Patrick, and thanks for the question, is really its organic build. It's the strength of the business. It's the strength in terms of demand that we're seeing in clinical and the applications across clinical and research to some extent. And some of that backlog is instruments. Some of it is consumables. So it's \u2013 it reflects the broad base of our business. In terms of supply chain, to address your question, I mean, as we talked about last quarter, obviously supply chain is more complicated these days with pandemic, with COVID. But we have taken a lot of steps and done a lot of initiatives to help preserve the continuity of the supply chain, to make sure our customers have uninterrupted access to product. So we have not seen really disruption in supply chain, given some of these actions aside from very isolated cases that we see traditionally, but nothing unusual in terms of disruptions to supply chain. We've made sure that we've increased the amount of distribution center capacity that we have, we've increased safety stock on consumables. We've taken a lot of steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain continues and that we can provide product to customers. So I just want to make sure that's clear. Yes. And Luke, with regards to the margin evolution throughout the year, I mean, we'll provide more updates on that as we go forward. We give you an update with regards to Q1 and what our guidance is for Q1 in terms of operating margins. We mentioned that Q1 is going to be a 300 basis point improvement from Q4 sequentially across consolidated Illumina, and we said that core Illumina in Q1 would be approximately 28%. Now going forward, we don't usually provide quarterly margin sort of comments, but we'll provide more updates as the year \u2013 as we go deeper into the year. Yes, there is one other dynamic, John, that I would add [Technical Difficulty] of total Illumina revenues. But if you look over the last, I mean, to Francis' comments, if you look over the last three years, the growth of clinical has exceeded the growth of research. And that just reflects \u2013 at both markets are growing very robustly, but that just reflects the fact that clinical markets with regards to oncology testing, genetic disease testing, NIPT have been growing really, really at an impressive clip. You're welcome."

With that, I now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis Desouza : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Illumina third quarter was another exceptionally strong quarter, with $1.108 billion in revenue, up 40% year-over-year, and once again, significantly ahead of expectations. Our customers base continues to expand rapidly. And in the first three quarters of 2021, we added 50% more new customers than in all of 2020 or 2019. Because of this strength across our business, we are raising our full-year revenue growth outlook for the 3nd quarter in a row, to approximately 36%. This is approximately double the growth rate and $567 million higher than the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of the year.  I will talk through the third quarter results for Core Illumina as defined as Illumina, other than GRAIL, and then I'll turn the call over to Barbara Gusta, the CEO of our GRAIL subsidiary to cover the GRAIL business. Core Illumina revenue was $1.106 billion. Sequencing instrument revenue was up 65% year-over-year. And we exited the quarter with a record instrument backlog, a positive leading indicator for future revenue. Sequencing activity in the quarter was also strong, with sequencing consumable revenue up 45% year-over-year, setting a new record.  Our high throughput platform order volume is accelerating. Oncology testing, population sequencing, and drug discovery initiatives, drove record NovaSeq consumables and instrument shipments. Oncology testing customers represented the highest proportions of NovaSeq shipment for the quarter as large oncology testing labs added to their fleets to support expanded reimbursement for therapy selection testing. Drug discovery is emerging as the new application for high [Indiscernible] sequencing, with opportunities across common diseases ranging from obesity to aging, our mid [Indiscernible] platforms also drove growth and expanded our installed base.  In the third quarter, over 50% of NovaSeq 1,000 2,000 placements were new to Illumina customer or to customers upgrading from low throughput instruments. These instruments continued to unlock new applications. Researchers at Tulane School of Medicine are using the NextSeq 2000 for single-cell experiments focused on infection and inflammation. The team is working to develop inhaled vaccines for pneumonia and use Single-cell RNA-seq on a NextSeq 2000 to study the immune cells elicited by this vaccine platform in a recent paper published in Science Immunology. Bench-top platforms also saw significant growth year-over-year, with the highest number of MiSeq shipments since Q4 2015.  MiSeq coupled with our COVIDSeq 96 sample assay, is enabling labs around the world to engage in local pathogen surveillance. This quarter MiSeq placements in both Argentina and Brazil brought COVID surveillance to local communities in conjunction with broader national programs. Now, turning to clinical and research and applied segments, Oncology Testing, our largest market segment, had another record quarter. Sequencing is becoming the standard of care in therapy selection, which is driving robust demand for Illumina's sequencers and our oncology testing customers are rapidly scaling their fleets in response.  Reimbursement for genetic testing for therapy selection continues to expand, with over 70% of insured lives in the U.S. now covered for these tests. Additionally, that are over 60 targeted and immunotherapy treatments currently on the market, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic profiling in matching patients to treatments. TruSight Oncology 500, our research used only Comprehensive Genomic Profiling assay, had another record quarter with over 340 customers now using the assay in their labs. In September, we announced the CDx partnerships with Merck to develop and commercialize tests, leveraging TSO 500 content, and an HRD status based on Myriad's myChoice in patients with ovarian cancer.  Approximately 300,000 women around the world, will be diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer; the 5th deadliest cancer for women. This partnership will help these patients access additional treatment options with the goal of improving care. In reproductive health, we saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth post. Of 80% of pregnancies in the U.S. are now covered for noninvasive prenatal. testing. And we're seeing additional progress as states begin to incorporate the ACOG guideline revision from last year into their prenatal screening programs. In California, the prenatal screening program is being revised to include non-invasive prenatal testing and the state has now issued a request for proposal.  NIPT is increasingly being incorporated into guidelines outside the US as well. In September, the Italian Ministry of Health issued new guidelines supporting the use NIPT in a contingent model. With the continued momentum in coverage guidelines, our end-to-end VeriSeq V2 solution is gaining traction across global markets. Genetic disease testing also posted another strong quarter as broad reimbursement and compelling clinical utility data drive a shift to whole genome sequencing. This quarter, the result of the groundbreaking NICUSeq trial, coauthored by Illumina scientists, were published in JAMA pediatrics.  The randomized time-delayed trial demonstrated that clinical whole genome sequencing drives a twofold improvement in both diagnostic efficacy and change of clinical management for acutely ill newborns. We are working to ensure that families and NICU patients around the world can access these tests. In the U.S. Michigan recently became the first State to offer rapid whole genome sequencing to acutely ill infants and children, regardless of insurance. And other states like California and Florida are making progress in this direction as well.  Outside the U.S. last week, we announced a pilot program in Israel to implement whole genome sequencing for critically ill infants suspected of having a genetic disorder and neonatal intensive care units. This program will accelerate time to diagnosis for these patients and support rapid clinical decision-making. Turning to our research and applied segments, we saw another strong quarter of sequential and year-over-year growth. The 30-plus population genomics initiatives that we support around the world drove growth in the quarter.  The accuracy and scalability of our sequencing platforms combined with our end-to-end solutions like Illumina Connected Analytics, make Illumina an ideal broader for large sequencing initiatives. The value of these population programs is expanding across clinical outcomes, research, and drug discovery. This traction is generating significant interest and investment for additional programs like Our Future Health, the UK 's largest ever research program focused on developing new ways to detect, treat, and prevent disease.  Just yesterday, we announced that Illumina Connected Analytics solutions are being used by HostSeq, part of the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network. Our sequencing and bioinformatics solutions will be used to identify biomarkers that can help predict potential risk of serious disease, and support the development of novel therapeutics to combat COVID-19. We anticipate these types of population programs will become increasingly critical to innovation as their findings translate into greater use of sequencing in clinical workflows and actionable data for drug discovery.  We're already seeing this with the initial data from the UK Biobank as the program concludes, Regeneron is utilizing the UK Biobank data in multiple ways, including defined more than 500 genes with Varian trade associations linked to higher risk of diseases like hypertension, asthma, and liver disease. And as part of the dataset to create new obesity medicines in partnership with AstraZeneca. And companies like Relay Therapeutics are utilizing genomic data along with AI and machine-learning to advance drug discovery. COVID surveillance drove $55 million in sequencing shipments in the quarter of which $15 million or instrument purchases as concerns about variance continue to heighten the focus on surveillance efforts.  We see the infrastructure for COVID surveillance as the foundation for broader pathogen surveillance to increase around the world. For example, CERI, a new genomics facility in South Africa, was launched this quarter with capabilities to bolster the pandemic and epidemic response across Africa. With resources like this in place, sequencing data from 51 of the 54 countries in Africa is now available in [Indiscernible]. And a total of 50,000 sars COVID -2 genomes have been sequenced, two months ahead of Africa CDC schedule. Turning to GRAIL. In August, we closed our acquisition, which we believe will help accelerate patient access and affordability for multi-cancer early detection screening.  I am delighted to introduce Bob Ragusa on his first call as GRAIL's CEO. Bob most recently served as Illumina's Chief Operations Officer, and he has more than 30 years of experience in genomics. He played a critical role in providing the sequencing systems for the Human Genome Project, and was responsible for significantly scaling Illumina's business in more than 140 countries and enabled the first NovaSeq shipments. With his decades of deep expertise, Bob is uniquely positioned to lead GRAIL during a time of extraordinary growth and discovery. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss GRAIL's business updates.\nBob Ragusa: Thank you, Francis. I'm honored to lead the talented team at GRAIL to advance the mission to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. I am pleased to share a few thoughts on our recent progress. First, I want to highlight gallery commercial progress. We see significant pre -reimbursement opportunities for gallery and encouraged with the momentum across our three primary channels. In the employer channel, we're gaining momentum and expect to announce notable new partnerships in the technology, industrial, professional services, and transportation sectors. We are also successfully engaging with key high cancer risk area of public sector employers such as firefighters.  For health systems, we are focused on establishing strategic agreements with influential systems in the medical community to increase awareness and experience with Galleri. Health systems are also strategic partners to generate real-world evidence in key patient communities and regions. To date, we have signed agreements with several health partners who are planning to start providing access to Galleri in the fourth quarter. We're also in contract discussions with several additional influential health systems that we expect will begin offering Galleri to patients early next year. In addition, we are excited to see interest from progressive and innovative payers, including Medicare Advantage, where we expect to communicate our first partnership soon.  Medical practices are an important driver of the Galleri launch. We have agreements with several of the largest primary care private practice networks and expect to continue to expand in this area. We are focused on onboarding physicians in these networks and see positive prescriber trends. We also recently partnered with Genome Medical, an independent healthcare provider, to serve individuals who prefer a telemedicine option.  We launched this service several weeks ago on galleri.com and believe this will be an important future pre -reimbursement growth driver. In addition, we partnered with PWN Health, a national telehealth network, to further extend our service capability for some employer programs. Additionally, in September, the state of New York granted approval for the Galleri test. The standard set by New York state represents one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for a laboratory developed test. Finally, there is tremendous excitement around the recent start of NHS-Galleri study. A 140,000 participant, real-world randomized controlled study that has generated widespread national and international media coverage. This is part of England's national priority to speed up earlier detection of cancer to improve survival. Enrollment has been robust and is on track with our expectations. Based on data generated from this initial study, access to Galleri could expand to around 1 million people in 2024 and '25, and to a larger population after that time.  Lastly, I would like to note that the reported GRAIL revenue represents both revenues recognized from the sale of our gallery pests and generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with bio pharmaceutical companies. We are encouraged by the initial test results generated with our partners and plan to expand the number of pilot studies to support development of MRD and PDX product opportunities. We also expect MRD and PDX collaboration and become more continue as an important component of GRAIL revenue mix and is an attractive future growth driver of our business. I look forward to sharing with you more about GRAIL progress in the coming quarters. Now I will turn it over to Sam.\nSam Samad : Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, then conclude with our outlook. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website.  Third quarter revenue, once again, significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 40% year-over-year to $1.108 billion. Driven by core Illumina revenue growth of 39% and $2 million of revenue from GRAIL. For the third quarter, GAAP net income was $317 million or $2.08 per diluted share, which included a $900 million gain from our previously held investment in GRAIL, as a part of the acquisition, and $654 million in day one compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $221 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, which included $0.19 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.06 of incremental dilution from the $9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition.  Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $153 million. Moving to the rest of the consolidated P&L. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million increased $57 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses of $50 million for the quarter and a $7 million increase in Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to a $163 million year-over-year, driven by $50 million of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses and a $113 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses.  Non-GAAP other expense of $6 million increased $4 million sequentially and was $13 million lower than other income in Q3 of last year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio and subsequently liquidated our holdings to fund the GRAIL acquisition. As well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. The non-GAAP tax rate of 13.2% decreased from last quarter and year-over-year due to the tax impact of including GRAIL in Illumina's consolidated results of operations.  The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2020, related to prior-year return adjust and tax reserve releases. Moving to segment results, I will start by highlighting the financial results of Core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $1.106 billion, driven by record shipments for both clinical and research. Core Illumina sequencing revenue of $1.013 billion grew 43% year-over-year and represented 92% of Core Illumina revenue. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $723 million, led by record NovaSeq consumable shipments that grew over 50% year-over-year.  Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina grew 65% year-over-year to $180 million driven by record NovaSeq shipments that again more than doubled year-over-year due to accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1,000 and 2,000 orders reached a new high in the quarter. And there was solid growth across all mid and low throughput systems year-over-year. We ended the quarter with record sequencing instrument backlog that is almost doubled the backlog entering the year. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance again exceeded our expectations due to the sustained focus on variant tracking and surveillance infrastructure scaling in the quarter, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $15 million in incremental instrument revenue.  Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $110 million, driven by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as GEL sample growth. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $581 million, growing 33% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record oncology testing shipments and ongoing population genomics initiatives such as all of us. The regional performance was also driven by COVID surveillance strength due to expanded Public Health Network Adoption of NGS in Latin America.  EMEA delivered revenue of $313 million, representing 47% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by significant growth across all clinical markets and strength in emerging markets. Population genomics initiatives partially driven by UK Biobank, which concluded in Q3. And COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong Third Quarter performance in the region. Greater China revenue was a $122 million representing growth of 47% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region led by NextSeqDx demand and hospitals and oncology testing [Indiscernible]. Almost half of the NextSeqDx shipments for the new to Illumina hospital customers.  And the expanding footprint in hospitals is helping drive growth in infectious disease testing, which more than doubled year-over-year. Finally, APJ revenue of $90 million grew 45% year-over-year, driven by sequencing instrument growth from clinical demand for NextSeq 2000, as well as consumables revenue growth across oncology testing and research. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.3% declined sequentially by 50 basis points due primarily to one-time revenue from the NIPT patent litigation settlement recorded in the prior quarter.  On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 390 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $478 million were up $7 million sequentially, but overall were lower than expected due to the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q4. As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $113 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth, as well as additional investments to support the significant growth of our business. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 28%, compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins declined sequentially as expected, mostly due to $20 million of one-time patent litigation settlement revenue recognized in the prior quarter. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $2 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Gallery test fees. The multi-cancer early detection tests that commercially launched in June, as well as moderate MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $50 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. As a reminder, GRAIL's third quarter financial results are for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18.  Moving to cash flow and Balance sheet items for consolidated Illumina. Cash flow used in operations was $272 million, which was an outflow for the quarter due to expenses related to the GRAIL acquisition. DSO of 50 days compared to 44 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Third quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was a negative $324 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, bank balance and [Indiscernible] investments. During the third quarter, we used $2.9 billion to fund the GRAIL acquisition.  Before I discuss guidance, I wanted to acknowledge that I'm especially proud of our team's strong execution to fulfill surging demand and deliver another record quarter and a challenging global environment. While there were some small pockets of supply constraints for certain products and specific geographies this quarter. There was no material impact thanks to our teams\u2019 incredible efforts. We will continue to source, produce and operate with agility to enable further growth and support our customers.  Moving now to 2021 guidance, we now expect full-year 2021 consolidated and Core Illumina revenue to grow approximately 36%. This represents consolidated revenue of approximately $4.41 billion for 2021, or revenue growth of approximately $1.17 billion compared to 2020, and an increase of approximately $100 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. For fiscal 2021, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 39% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our base business. We now expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be between 27.5% to 28%, which reflects our higher revenue expectations.  We expect Core Illumina operating expenses for Q4 2021 to increase by approximately $50 million compared to Q3 2021, due to the timing of expenses shifting from Q3 into Q4, increased investments to support the robust growth of our business, as well as expected payments in Q4 2021, related to certain partnerships. Our focus continues to be on improving the Core Illumina operating margin leverage over time. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.60. Which includes dilution from GRAIL operating loss of approximately $1 and incremental dilution of $0.15 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. We now expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.41 to $4.51. We now expect diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2021 to be approximately 151 million. For the Fourth Quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. And GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. We expect diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately $158 million. Now I will hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis Desouza : Thank you, Sam. Our third quarter performance reflects the strength of our business, the talent and dedication of our people, and the enduring value of our mission. Before I close, I would like to highlight how we are furthering this mission through our ESG work. Human health and the health of the environment are intertwined, as are our Company mission and our commitment to operating responsibly and sustainably.  In the third quarter, we announced aggressive environmental goals, including our Net Zero commitment to advance the climate component of our ESG strategy. Sam and I will discuss this strategy in greater detail at our inaugural ESG Investor event on November 16th, and we hope you will join us. To close, we saw remarkable performance and broad-based strength across our business in the third quarter. And we are both inspired and excited to see this momentum continuing into Q4.  We again raised our annual revenue guidance, and with our record instrument backlog, we're on pace for a strong finish to an exceptional 2021. We will build upon this strength as we seize opportunities to expand existing markets, including oncology testing and infectious disease along with new applications. Sequencing data will enable this expansion as we usher in the era of genomic medicine, and Illumina will be at the forefront of these innovations, supporting our customers as we collectively advanced human health. Now, I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A\nOperator: Thank you. The Q&A session is now open. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit your questions to one at a time. We have the first question on the sidelines from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Dan, please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Great. I thought for the first question, I would want to begin on the outlook for the fourth quarter. After a really strong start to the year, you're raising guidance. But the fourth-quarter looks to be conservative to us. And I'm just wondering a couple of things here. Is there anything implied further for COVID testing? I know you had $25 million to $30 million per quarter originally in your guidance, so the [Indiscernible] to the strong COVID here in Q3. And given the easy comp and given the backlog and the momentum, I am just wondering why the fourth quarter outlook might not be stronger. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nSam Samad : Yes. Thank you, Dan this is Sam and hope you're doing well. Welcome back and good to have you on the call. So, for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are as we talked about on the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the UK Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive, incredibly, I would say, very important initiative from a population genomics standpoint that we talked a little bit about the outcomes from that and the next steps.  But that's will likely present $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind or reduction in terms of revenues in Q4 versus Q3. So that's one area. And then the second area, and I think you touched on that in your question with regards to COVID surveillance. So COVID surveillance has been strong for the year, we've seen obviously, with the continue -- with the pandemic, the way it is. But there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter, that represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables.  For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenues, about $5 million, and then approximately $30 million of COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. When we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong, and when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those two items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the UK Biobank concluding.\nDan Brennan: Great. And then in terms of clinical, Francis, and therapy selection, you gave a lot of color there, you talked about customers rapidly adding platforms. Could you give us a sense of, I don't know if you have this information, but the install base that's supporting this customer base? What that's been growing at and what's the backlog look like and outlook for further growth in that area? Thank you.\nBob Ragusa: Yeah. Thanks, Dan and I'll add my welcome to account, and it's great to see you covering us again. So, I did talk a lot about the strength in the oncology segment, specifically oncology therapy selection testing because that really has been one of the breakout stories, frankly, for the whole year. And what's really driving that story is a few things. 1. We saw a significant expansion in reimbursement for genomic testing for therapy selection play out in the U.S., and so now we have a significant base in the U.S. that has coverage for genomic testing. And at the same time, we've seen a move towards larger panels as Comprehensive Genomic Profiling really gets traction in the market.  And so those two have created a powerful force and oncology therapy selection testing. And we're seeing our customers expanding their fleets. Now in terms of how that's playing out, you're seeing it play out across all segments. You're seeing some of our larger customers significantly expanding their fleets and expanding their Novaseq fleet specifically, because of the demand that they're seeing, as well as the anticipated demand going forward. But you're also seeing new customers and some are smaller customers get into oncology therapy selection.  One of the interesting messages to look at and it takes into account more than oncology, but I'd say oncology is one of the biggest drivers of it, is if you look at the strength in the NovaSeq instruments, you'd see we're placing a lot of NovaSeq instruments and we're having a very strong backlog of NovaSeq instruments. And at the same time, you're seeing really strong pull-through in NovaSeq. And so, that's sort of the pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow, right? Because you're seeing -- you're putting a lot of instruments out there and yet pull-through remains high end, the high end of the range we've talked about. And so, to your question about what's the outlook going forward, I'd say that's a really good positive indicator for what people is experiencing today, and what they are expecting going forward.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks, Francis.\nOperator: Thank you, Dan., We now have the next question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay, please go ahead when you're ready.\nVijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on a good print here and thanks for taking my question. I had one question on the implied Q4 guidance in fiscal '22. The updated EPS guidance of $5.50 to $5.60, that implies about I think $0.30 to $0.40 in Q4, are there -- is there -- is that Q4 -- do you have some one-off costs or is that something abnormal happening? Because that's an annualized run rate of $1.60. I don't think that sounds right. I just want to make sure I have that Q4 assumption right. And for fiscal 2021, should comps matter because most of your peers are assuming normalized growth. And given your comments around backlog, I understand we have surveillance being a bit component this year, but that 36% should comps matter and how should we think about it?\nSam Samad : Yes. So let me start by talking about Q4, Vijay, and we did talk about EPS guide of $0.35 to $0.45, non-GAAP EPS for Q4, including the effects of GRAIL. As I talked about it on the call, there are in Q4 -- there's $0.80 roughly of dilution a dollar for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there is about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. Those are specific to GRAIL that obviously impacts with $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4.  In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to -- to answer Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of Opex, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4, that's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 and now has increased in terms of our expectations for spent there and then I talked about also partnership Opex that is expected in Q4.  So, we do have some expenditures associated with certain partnerships that somewhat significance in Q4, that's discrete to Q4. In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022. That remains the case. That has not changed. But as you heard the backlog is very strong. In terms of instruments and the core fundamentals in terms of clinical and research are exceptionally strong.\nVijay Kumar : I'm sorry, just one clarification, Sam. The $3.25 to $3.75 dilution from GRAIL, that is not incremental, right? You guys have taken a $1.15 of dilution in fiscal '21. So, the $3.25 to $3.75, that is inclusive of the $1.15?\nSam Samad : That's total dilution for GRAIL in 2022. That's not incremental, that\u2019s the total dilution that we expect, $3.25 to $3.75 impact on non-GAAP EPS in 2022.\nVijay Kumar : Thanks for clarifying. Thanks guys.\nSam Samad : You're welcome\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho, please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. Sam, I want to hone in on your supply chain comments a little bit. It sounds like limited disruption up till now. We have heard about customers not being able to get flow sales and limited NovaSeq shipments, and you did exit the quarter with record backlog. So, can you maybe just touch on the supply chain dynamics now, given the low tele graft, well publicized shortages of semis, but also cameras and high adoptables?\nFrancis Desouza : Hey, Tycho, this is Francis. So, I'll start by saying, it's a good question because anytime you have just such a big beat and you have demand coming in so far ahead of expectations. I think now we're looking at the guide we've put out now is over 500 million over the midpoint of the guide we put out to the year there. So anytime you have such a big beat playing out against the backdrop of a pandemic, the first thing you look at is the supply chain, your ability to serve. And as we said on the call, I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done in terms of demand capacity planning to make sure that we are able to stay ahead of this big demand we're seeing.  And as we pointed out, we started to see this demand build at the tail end of the last year. And so, the teams did a lot of work on a number of fronts. First, they did work around making sure that our inbound supplies will be able to cope with the demand that was coming. And that meant things like building safety stock internally of supplies coming in, ordering items that would have long lead times, sometimes up to a year plus in advance or things like resins where we knew there might be shortages.  But then also we started to invest in increasing our own production capacity. And that was through across the board. So, whether it's [Indiscernible] cartridges, and closed sales, or raise, across the board, we started certainly by the first half of this year, we are significantly increasing capacity to build a supply. And then in addition to that, we started to invest starting last year and increasing our ability to move production. So specifically, for example, we expanded our warehousing capacity in Eindhoven and opened up a new center in Eindhoven and that's our regional distribution for me is you might know, and we doubled the capacity we had in Eindhoven.  Similarly, we expanded capacity in Japan this year from our warehousing perspective, we put a new warehouse in Brazil this year, and we also continue to invest in strengthening the transportation links between these hubs. And then we started to build safety stock on the outbound side to make sure that we had enough inventory on site to cope with what we knew was going to be strong demand ended up being much stronger than even we had expected, and so forth. The vast majority of our core consumables now, we have safety stock on hand that's 6 to 6 weeks of supply. And so, our team did a really terrific job sort of calling it early and then jumping on it end-to-end to make sure that we have the capacity to supply the demand coming in.\nBob Ragusa: Yeah. So, the only thing I would add to that, thank you, Francis is that the backlog is really strong and driven by the demand. All of those things that Francis mentioned are actions that we've taken to ensure there's continuity and the supply chain. And we're fulfilling customer orders on time. There have been I would say, a few isolated customer instances where there have been extensions of lead time which is normal. That's very much something that we see every quarter. But in general, the backlog is really driven by demand, it's not driven by any supply issues that are causing that.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas, please go ahead.\nTejas Savant : Hey, guys. Good evening. I have a quick question on GRAIL. Francis, do you have any updates from the regulators now that they've had some time to digest your decision to close? Have you heard anything from them on the structure of the whole separate agreement and the possibility of the fine? And then secondly, can you just lay out your plans to build out the commercial infrastructure here, now that Galleri is live and you started to see early traction from the Mayo Clinic and some of the other partners you highlighted in the prepared remarks?\nFrancis Desouza : Yes. Maybe I will talk about the regulatory process, Tejas. And then I will turn it over to Bob to talk about thoughts about commercial expansion. From a regulatory process perspective, there have been no surprises. It's frankly playing out just as we had expected. We are engaged with the two processes in the European Commission, and that's playing out. And we look to get a decision on the phase 2 to review that's happening in Europe at the tail end of Q1 likely may slip a little. And we are waiting for the trial date for the jurisdiction trial that's happening in Brussels. So yeah, that's expected. And then in the U.S., we are continuing to wrap up the administrative trial that just played out and we expect a decision likely in Q1 -- retail end of the year, but more likely in Q1. It's playing out as we expected in terms of the hold separate. The order came out and it was consistent with how we thought it would be and consistent with -- generally consistent with the hold separate that we put into place ourselves voluntarily in anticipation of how this would play out. In general, no real surprises. The process is playing out as we planned. I'll turn it over to you, Bob.\nBob Ragusa: Thanks, Francis. And thanks for the question on the commercial build-out. We're looking at the demand picture. We see significant pre -reimbursement opportunities for Galleri. And it's really across three main channels, employer, health systems, and medical practices. And one of the key elements of working with the team now is to make sure that we can in fact ramp up the commercial scale of the organization to really meet the demand that's out there.  And the addition, just like commercial side, we're going to have to ramp up the -- really an entire operation so that we have the ability to deliver at scale a great customer experience. And so that will cause us to build across a number of functions across the Company. Really excited to be able to take on that challenge because we were in a beautiful position of having product that are so strong, and now just really building out -- had the opportunity to build out all the commercial elements and all the delivery elements so that we can really deploy Gallery in in a big way.\nFrancis Desouza : Ye. Maybe I'll just add one other thing just from a personal perspective. We've rolled out the GRAIL test to Illumina employees. As I know, some of you listening may also have. And again, as a CEO, there are a few times in your career to get to roll out something that's university beloved annuals will save you money. And we started to see since the first people come and reach out to us and say that they've been able to -- they feel fortunate they've been able to find an early-stage cancer because of the Gallery tests. And the cancers they're talking about are ones that don't have other screens. And so, this is a personal realization of the power of this test.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. So, Patrick, please go ahead when you are ready.\nPatrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Francis, maybe one on China. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? There is obviously a lot of noise in different parts of the market and you guys put a pretty good result. Can you talk about the trends there you're seeing and expectations going forward?\nFrancis Desouza : Yeah. We have continued to see a really strong performance out of China. We, overall, had 47% year-over-year growth. The growth in China continues to be driven by the clinical markets. And so, our strategy, starting last year, of really focusing on the emerging hospital market is really paying dividends. It's a market that's really embracing not just NIPT, which they embraced early, but increasingly also starting to more broadly roll out oncology testing, genomic testing. And so, we're seeing progress there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China.  That's really paying off. In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but as already started to pay dividends, as we see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability. And so that's helped us driving some of the tailwind there. But we're definitely excited and optimistic about what's happening in China for us right now.\nPatrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe one on the population sequencing, you obviously called out UK Biobank concluded this quarter. Can you just update us on how you're feeling about those rolling out? And again, as we see some data and see the use of UK Biobank potential for that to become a bigger piece for you guys?\nFrancis Desouza : Yeah, absolutely. One of the things that is really great to see is the broadening of the base of population sequencing customers. So, we talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective, which also really great about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven as from a national health perspective.  So, they aren't research projects, what you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of a standard of care in a health system. And that's terrific, first of all, because of the human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, so it means once you are built into the healthcare system, then you just get ramped up to population scales and it goes year-after-year.  And so that's another really exciting thing to see. The other thing that's playing out is, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners, that are looking to generate data from -- population level data from some of the big data repositories out there around the world like biobanks. And so that's an emerging and then sort of building parts of the population sequencing ecosystem right now too.\nOperator: We now have Derik De Bruin of Bank of America on the line. So, Derik, please go ahead. You may proceed with your question.\nMike: Hey, this is my question on for Derik. Thanks for taking the question. Got a couple of quick ones, and I'm just going to focus on sequencing instruments side of the business. You called out really broad strength, [Indiscernible] having NovaSeq, NextSeqDx, 1,000 to 2,000 and the MiSeq. That's pretty much the majority of portfolio. But total sequencing instrument number revenue still declined sequentially. So, I'm just wondering if you could talk to pricing dynamics or an AFT if there's anything unusual going in there mid-year? And then I've got a follow-up on that.\nFrancis Desouza : Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. And appreciate the question. Listen, in general, there is really no fundamental change at all in terms of the -- in terms of instrument demand from Q3 or Q2 into Q3. In general, we do have sometimes some ebb and flow between the quarters in terms of instrument revenues, NovaSeq had record revenues for the quarter. Record placements in terms of doubling the placements that we had last year. As we said, we exited the quarter with record backlog in terms of instruments.  So, I would say there's probably some very small movements here and there, but nothing really that's anything significant in terms of why we were slightly down in terms of Q2 versus -- Q3 versus Q2. In terms of sequencing instruments as well for COVID surveillance, I would say that was a minor factor as well from Q2 into Q3.\nSam Samad : There were a few fewer sequencing instruments that were placed in Q3 compared to Q2, so that had a little bit of an impact there as well. But in general, demand is exceptionally strong as we talked about, with doubling the NextSeq 2000, 1000, and 550 placements versus prior years, not just last year but prior, historically what we used to place in the mid throughput category and then the NovaSeq demand is exceptionally strong.\nFrancis Desouza : Yeah, let me reiterate what Sam just said around -- look, we are walking into Q4 having had -- with a record instrument backlog. It's a really strong place to be. We had record instrument shipments in Q3 for NovaSeq and the pull-through on NovaSeq, even with all the instruments we just placed, and you expect a lot of them are still in their ramp up mode, they should be at the low end of pull through.  But even with that, the total average pull-through on NovaSeq are the high-end of the range we've talked about. So, it\u2019s in fact there. And so, there's just a lot of activity happening on our NovaSeq South in the field. And that's causing customers to place the orders that are driving the record backlog that we have walking into Q4. And so, we really feel that it's a really fantastically strong position to be.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink on the line. Sir Puneet, please go head. When you're ready.\nCooney Sudov: Thanks, Francis. And thanks for taking the question. First one on GRAIL, and actually maybe this is for Francis and some for Bob, just in terms of the trials that you have to conduct at this point in time, you mentioned the UK NHS trial ongoing. Obviously, you've committed to GRAIL and taken on the dilution, but in terms of the overall trials that you need that are prospective registrational trial that FDA needs to look at that are prevalence reflecting trials in order to get a screening assay approved on the market, if you could walk us through that.  What are you doing to progress towards that? What's the timing of it? What is that trial as you can initiate that trial or is it any other trial or banked samples that you have already collected that you can potentially run and submit that data? I'm just trying to understand in terms of the -- more than 50,000, 100,000 patient trial that is needed in order to get an FDA approval, and then eventually reimbursement and guideline inclusion?\nFrancis Desouza : Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Bob. I'll say, what we said before continues to be true today, which is in the U.S., this test is going to be -- has been rolled out as an LDT and it doesn't need anything more. It's on the market today, it's a self-pay test you can order today, some employers are already covering it. There are some health systems that are looking to roll it out. And if it's a concierge system it could be, for example, a part of a subscription model or early models. And so, nothing in the U.S. is needed for the test to continue to be on the market. It's been on the market since June and nothing on the -- nothing in terms of trials is needed for the existing revenue sources that Bob talked about to be real.  Everything in terms of studies and data is all out there. In fact, the early studies that were published early this year just reinforced already the huge amount of data that's been put out onto the market so far, so nothing more is needed there. And what we said about the NHS is, the NHS is sort of a self-contained trial in the sense that it has designed the milestones and the progress that would get it comfortable rolling it out at a population scale.  And they were the ones who rolled out the path that said it could start with about 140,000 then scale up to a million in the next couple of years and then go population scale. And so, it's a fully self-contained process. They've identified what they need to see. They're partnering with GRAIL. That's what we've said before, and that's what we continue to see. And I'll turn it over to Bob.\nBob Ragusa: Thanks, Francis. Maybe a few other comments on it. Really three key elements driving towards that. 1. The NHS study that we've talked about, with 140,000 participants and then that expanding over the years. So that will provide enormous set of data. We also have the Pathfinder study, which will conclude the middle of next year. And so far, the data to date has shown generally consistent with the early validation data, so that's very, very positive to this point.  And then also, reflection -- the gallery reflection registry study where we'll look at the experiencing clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50. We were prescribed the test from a healthcare provider, and that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the marks to reimbursement. Want to amplify also way Francis said there was -- even without reimbursement, there is a tremendous amount of pre -reimbursement activity and pre -reimbursement opportunity for Gallery. And so, while the march to reimbursement is incredibly important, it's not the only factor to look at.\nOperator: Thank you. As we are almost out of time, our last question comes from Kyle Mikson of Canaccord. Kyle, please go ahead.\nKyle Mikson : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to confirm one thing here on GRAIL. First on timelines, I hope this was alluded to earlier, but the pause in the investigation and it's been resumed that this is in early February now. Honestly, most of these decisions for trials and reviews are kind of expecting first quarter of '22. I just wanted to ask how much clarity will be provided when these events conclude. Obviously, it's been a pretty polarizing topic. I just think it'd be helpful to understand the level of visibility regarding, I guess, the regulatory outcome that you expect to have beyond the first quarter of 22.  And just one other thing to tack on here. The GRAIL revenue performance in the quarter, it looks like it was maybe 5 years or so we'll be kind of spread out throughout the 3 months at the annualized $20 million. Just want to understand what the maybe test volume trends are and maybe even reimbursement as well would be helpful. Thanks.\nFrancis Desouza : Yes. Maybe I'll start and say look, as we think about GRAIL, I want it to be the path forward in terms of the priority, I know it's been a question that investors have asked. And so, our perspective is obviously going to continue to work through the trials process. And I will give you an update on that. But what we want to do is make sure that GRAIL continues to create value because what that means is that no matter what scenario plays out in the event that we get done and we have GRAIL and we can grow at that huge, huge success obviously, and hugely valuable for our shareholders.  But we know that if we create a lot of value and GRAIL in no matter what the regulatory outcome is, it's still a big win not only for people who are getting screened, but also for our shareholders, because we'll have an asset that's significantly appreciated. And even if you look at the progress that's been made at GRAIL since we announced the deal, since we announced the deal, they've published some of their study results. They have launched a product on the schedule they said in June.  They have initiated not only signed the NHS deal, but started the rollout to 140,000 customers and signed up some other healthcare systems and employers in the U.S. So, it's clear the business has created significant value from maybe 12-15 months ago when we announced the deal. And to our focus is going to be partially also just to make sure that Bob and his team have everything they need to go create a hugely valuable business. And what that does is it ensures our shareholding, somebody seeing no matter what the outcome is.  It's a win for our shareholders. So, I want to make sure that if you were very clear that that's continuing to happen while we talk a lot about the trial. For our trial perspective, we expect -- the decisions we expect out in Europe come on 2 fronts, right? So, as you pointed out, the phase 2 results right now, the date is February 24th. That makes slip a little, but we expect to result from phase 2 around that timeframe, so late Q1 maybe already Q2. We're also looking for a date in the trial around jurisdiction in Brussels. And that's also a first-half thing, maybe sort of maybe Q1, maybe Q2.  Should we prevail in either of those then we're done with the -- with the regulatory process in the European Union. If we don't, then depending on which one there's appeals process that you go through. And then still in the FTC, we expect a decision, as I said, in Q1 around the administrative process. Inevitably, there will be a re-review or an appeal to the commissioners after that. And then you go -- if you -- if we don't prevail on any of those steps, then we've got our district court probably in the back half of next year. So that's the process. And I will turn it over to Bob Ragusa for any other color.\nBob Ragusa: Yeah, just on the revenue question. So, grow revenue represents both revenues recognized from the sale of our Gallery test, as well as our revenues generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We expect the MRD PDx collaboration income will continue as an important component of gross revenue and as an attractive future growth element of our business. We do expect the mix of the GRAIL pharma MRD revenue components during the early launch phase to be variable from quarter-to-quarter. And so, the overall revenue is not really -- because of the mix of pricing and that the overall revenue is not a real great indicator of sample volume.\nOperator: Thank you. As you have no further questions on the time, I will hand it back to Brian Blanchett for some closing remarks.\nBrian Blanchett : Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on the Investors section of our website, as well as through the dial instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update following the close of 2021.\nOperator: Thank you again for joining. Today's Illumina Q3 2021 Earnings Call. Today's call has now concluded. You may now disconnect your lines and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Francis Desouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Illumina third quarter was another exceptionally strong quarter, with $1.108 billion in revenue, up 40% year-over-year, and once again, significantly ahead of expectations. Our customers base continues to expand rapidly. And in the first three quarters of 2021, we added 50% more new customers than in all of 2020 or 2019. Because of this strength across our business, we are raising our full-year revenue growth outlook for the 3nd quarter in a row, to approximately 36%. This is approximately double the growth rate and $567 million higher than the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of the year.  I will talk through the third quarter results for Core Illumina as defined as Illumina, other than GRAIL, and then I'll turn the call over to Barbara Gusta, the CEO of our GRAIL subsidiary to cover the GRAIL business. Core Illumina revenue was $1.106 billion. Sequencing instrument revenue was up 65% year-over-year. And we exited the quarter with a record instrument backlog, a positive leading indicator for future revenue. Sequencing activity in the quarter was also strong, with sequencing consumable revenue up 45% year-over-year, setting a new record.  Our high throughput platform order volume is accelerating. Oncology testing, population sequencing, and drug discovery initiatives, drove record NovaSeq consumables and instrument shipments. Oncology testing customers represented the highest proportions of NovaSeq shipment for the quarter as large oncology testing labs added to their fleets to support expanded reimbursement for therapy selection testing. Drug discovery is emerging as the new application for high [Indiscernible] sequencing, with opportunities across common diseases ranging from obesity to aging, our mid [Indiscernible] platforms also drove growth and expanded our installed base.  In the third quarter, over 50% of NovaSeq 1,000 2,000 placements were new to Illumina customer or to customers upgrading from low throughput instruments. These instruments continued to unlock new applications. Researchers at Tulane School of Medicine are using the NextSeq 2000 for single-cell experiments focused on infection and inflammation. The team is working to develop inhaled vaccines for pneumonia and use Single-cell RNA-seq on a NextSeq 2000 to study the immune cells elicited by this vaccine platform in a recent paper published in Science Immunology. Bench-top platforms also saw significant growth year-over-year, with the highest number of MiSeq shipments since Q4 2015.  MiSeq coupled with our COVIDSeq 96 sample assay, is enabling labs around the world to engage in local pathogen surveillance. This quarter MiSeq placements in both Argentina and Brazil brought COVID surveillance to local communities in conjunction with broader national programs. Now, turning to clinical and research and applied segments, Oncology Testing, our largest market segment, had another record quarter. Sequencing is becoming the standard of care in therapy selection, which is driving robust demand for Illumina's sequencers and our oncology testing customers are rapidly scaling their fleets in response.  Reimbursement for genetic testing for therapy selection continues to expand, with over 70% of insured lives in the U.S. now covered for these tests. Additionally, that are over 60 targeted and immunotherapy treatments currently on the market, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic profiling in matching patients to treatments. TruSight Oncology 500, our research used only Comprehensive Genomic Profiling assay, had another record quarter with over 340 customers now using the assay in their labs. In September, we announced the CDx partnerships with Merck to develop and commercialize tests, leveraging TSO 500 content, and an HRD status based on Myriad's myChoice in patients with ovarian cancer.  Approximately 300,000 women around the world, will be diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer; the 5th deadliest cancer for women. This partnership will help these patients access additional treatment options with the goal of improving care. In reproductive health, we saw another quarter of strong year-over-year growth post. Of 80% of pregnancies in the U.S. are now covered for noninvasive prenatal. testing. And we're seeing additional progress as states begin to incorporate the ACOG guideline revision from last year into their prenatal screening programs. In California, the prenatal screening program is being revised to include non-invasive prenatal testing and the state has now issued a request for proposal.  NIPT is increasingly being incorporated into guidelines outside the US as well. In September, the Italian Ministry of Health issued new guidelines supporting the use NIPT in a contingent model. With the continued momentum in coverage guidelines, our end-to-end VeriSeq V2 solution is gaining traction across global markets. Genetic disease testing also posted another strong quarter as broad reimbursement and compelling clinical utility data drive a shift to whole genome sequencing. This quarter, the result of the groundbreaking NICUSeq trial, coauthored by Illumina scientists, were published in JAMA pediatrics.  The randomized time-delayed trial demonstrated that clinical whole genome sequencing drives a twofold improvement in both diagnostic efficacy and change of clinical management for acutely ill newborns. We are working to ensure that families and NICU patients around the world can access these tests. In the U.S. Michigan recently became the first State to offer rapid whole genome sequencing to acutely ill infants and children, regardless of insurance. And other states like California and Florida are making progress in this direction as well.  Outside the U.S. last week, we announced a pilot program in Israel to implement whole genome sequencing for critically ill infants suspected of having a genetic disorder and neonatal intensive care units. This program will accelerate time to diagnosis for these patients and support rapid clinical decision-making. Turning to our research and applied segments, we saw another strong quarter of sequential and year-over-year growth. The 30-plus population genomics initiatives that we support around the world drove growth in the quarter.  The accuracy and scalability of our sequencing platforms combined with our end-to-end solutions like Illumina Connected Analytics, make Illumina an ideal broader for large sequencing initiatives. The value of these population programs is expanding across clinical outcomes, research, and drug discovery. This traction is generating significant interest and investment for additional programs like Our Future Health, the UK 's largest ever research program focused on developing new ways to detect, treat, and prevent disease.  Just yesterday, we announced that Illumina Connected Analytics solutions are being used by HostSeq, part of the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network. Our sequencing and bioinformatics solutions will be used to identify biomarkers that can help predict potential risk of serious disease, and support the development of novel therapeutics to combat COVID-19. We anticipate these types of population programs will become increasingly critical to innovation as their findings translate into greater use of sequencing in clinical workflows and actionable data for drug discovery.  We're already seeing this with the initial data from the UK Biobank as the program concludes, Regeneron is utilizing the UK Biobank data in multiple ways, including defined more than 500 genes with Varian trade associations linked to higher risk of diseases like hypertension, asthma, and liver disease. And as part of the dataset to create new obesity medicines in partnership with AstraZeneca. And companies like Relay Therapeutics are utilizing genomic data along with AI and machine-learning to advance drug discovery. COVID surveillance drove $55 million in sequencing shipments in the quarter of which $15 million or instrument purchases as concerns about variance continue to heighten the focus on surveillance efforts.  We see the infrastructure for COVID surveillance as the foundation for broader pathogen surveillance to increase around the world. For example, CERI, a new genomics facility in South Africa, was launched this quarter with capabilities to bolster the pandemic and epidemic response across Africa. With resources like this in place, sequencing data from 51 of the 54 countries in Africa is now available in [Indiscernible]. And a total of 50,000 sars COVID -2 genomes have been sequenced, two months ahead of Africa CDC schedule. Turning to GRAIL. In August, we closed our acquisition, which we believe will help accelerate patient access and affordability for multi-cancer early detection screening.  I am delighted to introduce Bob Ragusa on his first call as GRAIL's CEO. Bob most recently served as Illumina's Chief Operations Officer, and he has more than 30 years of experience in genomics. He played a critical role in providing the sequencing systems for the Human Genome Project, and was responsible for significantly scaling Illumina's business in more than 140 countries and enabled the first NovaSeq shipments. With his decades of deep expertise, Bob is uniquely positioned to lead GRAIL during a time of extraordinary growth and discovery. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss GRAIL's business updates. Thank you, Sam. Our third quarter performance reflects the strength of our business, the talent and dedication of our people, and the enduring value of our mission. Before I close, I would like to highlight how we are furthering this mission through our ESG work. Human health and the health of the environment are intertwined, as are our Company mission and our commitment to operating responsibly and sustainably.  In the third quarter, we announced aggressive environmental goals, including our Net Zero commitment to advance the climate component of our ESG strategy. Sam and I will discuss this strategy in greater detail at our inaugural ESG Investor event on November 16th, and we hope you will join us. To close, we saw remarkable performance and broad-based strength across our business in the third quarter. And we are both inspired and excited to see this momentum continuing into Q4.  We again raised our annual revenue guidance, and with our record instrument backlog, we're on pace for a strong finish to an exceptional 2021. We will build upon this strength as we seize opportunities to expand existing markets, including oncology testing and infectious disease along with new applications. Sequencing data will enable this expansion as we usher in the era of genomic medicine, and Illumina will be at the forefront of these innovations, supporting our customers as we collectively advanced human health. Now, I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A Hey, Tycho, this is Francis. So, I'll start by saying, it's a good question because anytime you have just such a big beat and you have demand coming in so far ahead of expectations. I think now we're looking at the guide we've put out now is over 500 million over the midpoint of the guide we put out to the year there. So anytime you have such a big beat playing out against the backdrop of a pandemic, the first thing you look at is the supply chain, your ability to serve. And as we said on the call, I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done in terms of demand capacity planning to make sure that we are able to stay ahead of this big demand we're seeing.  And as we pointed out, we started to see this demand build at the tail end of the last year. And so, the teams did a lot of work on a number of fronts. First, they did work around making sure that our inbound supplies will be able to cope with the demand that was coming. And that meant things like building safety stock internally of supplies coming in, ordering items that would have long lead times, sometimes up to a year plus in advance or things like resins where we knew there might be shortages.  But then also we started to invest in increasing our own production capacity. And that was through across the board. So, whether it's [Indiscernible] cartridges, and closed sales, or raise, across the board, we started certainly by the first half of this year, we are significantly increasing capacity to build a supply. And then in addition to that, we started to invest starting last year and increasing our ability to move production. So specifically, for example, we expanded our warehousing capacity in Eindhoven and opened up a new center in Eindhoven and that's our regional distribution for me is you might know, and we doubled the capacity we had in Eindhoven.  Similarly, we expanded capacity in Japan this year from our warehousing perspective, we put a new warehouse in Brazil this year, and we also continue to invest in strengthening the transportation links between these hubs. And then we started to build safety stock on the outbound side to make sure that we had enough inventory on site to cope with what we knew was going to be strong demand ended up being much stronger than even we had expected, and so forth. The vast majority of our core consumables now, we have safety stock on hand that's 6 to 6 weeks of supply. And so, our team did a really terrific job sort of calling it early and then jumping on it end-to-end to make sure that we have the capacity to supply the demand coming in. Yes. Maybe I will talk about the regulatory process, Tejas. And then I will turn it over to Bob to talk about thoughts about commercial expansion. From a regulatory process perspective, there have been no surprises. It's frankly playing out just as we had expected. We are engaged with the two processes in the European Commission, and that's playing out. And we look to get a decision on the phase 2 to review that's happening in Europe at the tail end of Q1 likely may slip a little. And we are waiting for the trial date for the jurisdiction trial that's happening in Brussels. So yeah, that's expected. And then in the U.S., we are continuing to wrap up the administrative trial that just played out and we expect a decision likely in Q1 -- retail end of the year, but more likely in Q1. It's playing out as we expected in terms of the hold separate. The order came out and it was consistent with how we thought it would be and consistent with -- generally consistent with the hold separate that we put into place ourselves voluntarily in anticipation of how this would play out. In general, no real surprises. The process is playing out as we planned. I'll turn it over to you, Bob. Ye. Maybe I'll just add one other thing just from a personal perspective. We've rolled out the GRAIL test to Illumina employees. As I know, some of you listening may also have. And again, as a CEO, there are a few times in your career to get to roll out something that's university beloved annuals will save you money. And we started to see since the first people come and reach out to us and say that they've been able to -- they feel fortunate they've been able to find an early-stage cancer because of the Gallery tests. And the cancers they're talking about are ones that don't have other screens. And so, this is a personal realization of the power of this test. Yeah. We have continued to see a really strong performance out of China. We, overall, had 47% year-over-year growth. The growth in China continues to be driven by the clinical markets. And so, our strategy, starting last year, of really focusing on the emerging hospital market is really paying dividends. It's a market that's really embracing not just NIPT, which they embraced early, but increasingly also starting to more broadly roll out oncology testing, genomic testing. And so, we're seeing progress there. A lot of it is driven by the terrific partner ecosystem that we've built up over the years in China.  That's really paying off. In addition, we're actually seeing a tailwind associated with some regulations that have emerged that allow the use LDTs in Shanghai. And so that has been -- that's fairly recent, but as already started to pay dividends, as we see more labs being stood up to generate their own LDT testing capability. And so that's helped us driving some of the tailwind there. But we're definitely excited and optimistic about what's happening in China for us right now. Yeah, absolutely. One of the things that is really great to see is the broadening of the base of population sequencing customers. So, we talked about the fact that we've been cultivating over 50 of these opportunities, and we're now at the stage where over 30 of these opportunities are already generating revenue. So that's really good to see from a diversification perspective, which also really great about it is a lot of these population sequencing initiatives are driven as from a national health perspective.  So, they aren't research projects, what you're seeing is countries embrace genomic testing as part of a standard of care in a health system. And that's terrific, first of all, because of the human impact it allows you to have because you're in the pathway of delivering valuable information to patients. But it also is a place that's very durable, so it means once you are built into the healthcare system, then you just get ramped up to population scales and it goes year-after-year.  And so that's another really exciting thing to see. The other thing that's playing out is, we're starting to see the emergence of cohorts, a lot of them involving pharma partners, that are looking to generate data from -- population level data from some of the big data repositories out there around the world like biobanks. And so that's an emerging and then sort of building parts of the population sequencing ecosystem right now too. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. And appreciate the question. Listen, in general, there is really no fundamental change at all in terms of the -- in terms of instrument demand from Q3 or Q2 into Q3. In general, we do have sometimes some ebb and flow between the quarters in terms of instrument revenues, NovaSeq had record revenues for the quarter. Record placements in terms of doubling the placements that we had last year. As we said, we exited the quarter with record backlog in terms of instruments.  So, I would say there's probably some very small movements here and there, but nothing really that's anything significant in terms of why we were slightly down in terms of Q2 versus -- Q3 versus Q2. In terms of sequencing instruments as well for COVID surveillance, I would say that was a minor factor as well from Q2 into Q3. Yeah, let me reiterate what Sam just said around -- look, we are walking into Q4 having had -- with a record instrument backlog. It's a really strong place to be. We had record instrument shipments in Q3 for NovaSeq and the pull-through on NovaSeq, even with all the instruments we just placed, and you expect a lot of them are still in their ramp up mode, they should be at the low end of pull through.  But even with that, the total average pull-through on NovaSeq are the high-end of the range we've talked about. So, it's in fact there. And so, there's just a lot of activity happening on our NovaSeq South in the field. And that's causing customers to place the orders that are driving the record backlog that we have walking into Q4. And so, we really feel that it's a really fantastically strong position to be. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Bob. I'll say, what we said before continues to be true today, which is in the U.S., this test is going to be -- has been rolled out as an LDT and it doesn't need anything more. It's on the market today, it's a self-pay test you can order today, some employers are already covering it. There are some health systems that are looking to roll it out. And if it's a concierge system it could be, for example, a part of a subscription model or early models. And so, nothing in the U.S. is needed for the test to continue to be on the market. It's been on the market since June and nothing on the -- nothing in terms of trials is needed for the existing revenue sources that Bob talked about to be real.  Everything in terms of studies and data is all out there. In fact, the early studies that were published early this year just reinforced already the huge amount of data that's been put out onto the market so far, so nothing more is needed there. And what we said about the NHS is, the NHS is sort of a self-contained trial in the sense that it has designed the milestones and the progress that would get it comfortable rolling it out at a population scale.  And they were the ones who rolled out the path that said it could start with about 140,000 then scale up to a million in the next couple of years and then go population scale. And so, it's a fully self-contained process. They've identified what they need to see. They're partnering with GRAIL. That's what we've said before, and that's what we continue to see. And I'll turn it over to Bob. Yes. Maybe I'll start and say look, as we think about GRAIL, I want it to be the path forward in terms of the priority, I know it's been a question that investors have asked. And so, our perspective is obviously going to continue to work through the trials process. And I will give you an update on that. But what we want to do is make sure that GRAIL continues to create value because what that means is that no matter what scenario plays out in the event that we get done and we have GRAIL and we can grow at that huge, huge success obviously, and hugely valuable for our shareholders.

And I will turn it over to Bob Ragusa for any other color."

            "content": "Thank you, Francis. I'm honored to lead the talented team at GRAIL to advance the mission to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. I am pleased to share a few thoughts on our recent progress. First, I want to highlight gallery commercial progress. We see significant pre -reimbursement opportunities for gallery and encouraged with the momentum across our three primary channels. In the employer channel, we're gaining momentum and expect to announce notable new partnerships in the technology, industrial, professional services, and transportation sectors. We are also successfully engaging with key high cancer risk area of public sector employers such as firefighters.  For health systems, we are focused on establishing strategic agreements with influential systems in the medical community to increase awareness and experience with Galleri. Health systems are also strategic partners to generate real-world evidence in key patient communities and regions. To date, we have signed agreements with several health partners who are planning to start providing access to Galleri in the fourth quarter. We're also in contract discussions with several additional influential health systems that we expect will begin offering Galleri to patients early next year. In addition, we are excited to see interest from progressive and innovative payers, including Medicare Advantage, where we expect to communicate our first partnership soon.  Medical practices are an important driver of the Galleri launch. We have agreements with several of the largest primary care private practice networks and expect to continue to expand in this area. We are focused on onboarding physicians in these networks and see positive prescriber trends. We also recently partnered with Genome Medical, an independent healthcare provider, to serve individuals who prefer a telemedicine option.  We launched this service several weeks ago on galleri.com and believe this will be an important future pre -reimbursement growth driver. In addition, we partnered with PWN Health, a national telehealth network, to further extend our service capability for some employer programs. Additionally, in September, the state of New York granted approval for the Galleri test. The standard set by New York state represents one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for a laboratory developed test. Finally, there is tremendous excitement around the recent start of NHS-Galleri study. A 140,000 participant, real-world randomized controlled study that has generated widespread national and international media coverage. This is part of England's national priority to speed up earlier detection of cancer to improve survival. Enrollment has been robust and is on track with our expectations. Based on data generated from this initial study, access to Galleri could expand to around 1 million people in 2024 and '25, and to a larger population after that time.  Lastly, I would like to note that the reported GRAIL revenue represents both revenues recognized from the sale of our gallery pests and generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with bio pharmaceutical companies. We are encouraged by the initial test results generated with our partners and plan to expand the number of pilot studies to support development of MRD and PDX product opportunities. We also expect MRD and PDX collaboration and become more continue as an important component of GRAIL revenue mix and is an attractive future growth driver of our business. I look forward to sharing with you more about GRAIL progress in the coming quarters. Now I will turn it over to Sam. Yeah. Thanks, Dan and I'll add my welcome to account, and it's great to see you covering us again. So, I did talk a lot about the strength in the oncology segment, specifically oncology therapy selection testing because that really has been one of the breakout stories, frankly, for the whole year. And what's really driving that story is a few things. 1. We saw a significant expansion in reimbursement for genomic testing for therapy selection play out in the U.S., and so now we have a significant base in the U.S. that has coverage for genomic testing. And at the same time, we've seen a move towards larger panels as Comprehensive Genomic Profiling really gets traction in the market.  And so those two have created a powerful force and oncology therapy selection testing. And we're seeing our customers expanding their fleets. Now in terms of how that's playing out, you're seeing it play out across all segments. You're seeing some of our larger customers significantly expanding their fleets and expanding their Novaseq fleet specifically, because of the demand that they're seeing, as well as the anticipated demand going forward. But you're also seeing new customers and some are smaller customers get into oncology therapy selection.  One of the interesting messages to look at and it takes into account more than oncology, but I'd say oncology is one of the biggest drivers of it, is if you look at the strength in the NovaSeq instruments, you'd see we're placing a lot of NovaSeq instruments and we're having a very strong backlog of NovaSeq instruments. And at the same time, you're seeing really strong pull-through in NovaSeq. And so, that's sort of the pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow, right? Because you're seeing -- you're putting a lot of instruments out there and yet pull-through remains high end, the high end of the range we've talked about. And so, to your question about what's the outlook going forward, I'd say that's a really good positive indicator for what people is experiencing today, and what they are expecting going forward. Yeah. So, the only thing I would add to that, thank you, Francis is that the backlog is really strong and driven by the demand. All of those things that Francis mentioned are actions that we've taken to ensure there's continuity and the supply chain. And we're fulfilling customer orders on time. There have been I would say, a few isolated customer instances where there have been extensions of lead time which is normal. That's very much something that we see every quarter. But in general, the backlog is really driven by demand, it's not driven by any supply issues that are causing that. Thanks, Francis. And thanks for the question on the commercial build-out. We're looking at the demand picture. We see significant pre -reimbursement opportunities for Galleri. And it's really across three main channels, employer, health systems, and medical practices. And one of the key elements of working with the team now is to make sure that we can in fact ramp up the commercial scale of the organization to really meet the demand that's out there.  And the addition, just like commercial side, we're going to have to ramp up the -- really an entire operation so that we have the ability to deliver at scale a great customer experience. And so that will cause us to build across a number of functions across the Company. Really excited to be able to take on that challenge because we were in a beautiful position of having product that are so strong, and now just really building out -- had the opportunity to build out all the commercial elements and all the delivery elements so that we can really deploy Gallery in in a big way. Thanks, Francis. Maybe a few other comments on it. Really three key elements driving towards that. 1. The NHS study that we've talked about, with 140,000 participants and then that expanding over the years. So that will provide enormous set of data. We also have the Pathfinder study, which will conclude the middle of next year. And so far, the data to date has shown generally consistent with the early validation data, so that's very, very positive to this point.  And then also, reflection -- the gallery reflection registry study where we'll look at the experiencing clinical outcomes of 35,000 screening eligible patients over the age of 50. We were prescribed the test from a healthcare provider, and that enrollment began this quarter, and that will also provide significant data on the marks to reimbursement. Want to amplify also way Francis said there was -- even without reimbursement, there is a tremendous amount of pre -reimbursement activity and pre -reimbursement opportunity for Gallery. And so, while the march to reimbursement is incredibly important, it's not the only factor to look at. Yeah, just on the revenue question. So, grow revenue represents both revenues recognized from the sale of our Gallery test, as well as our revenues generated from our MRD collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies. We expect the MRD PDx collaboration income will continue as an important component of gross revenue and as an attractive future growth element of our business. We do expect the mix of the GRAIL pharma MRD revenue components during the early launch phase to be variable from quarter-to-quarter. And so, the overall revenue is not really -- because of the mix of pricing and that the overall revenue is not a real great indicator of sample volume."

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18, 2021. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, then conclude with our outlook. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website.  Third quarter revenue, once again, significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 40% year-over-year to $1.108 billion. Driven by core Illumina revenue growth of 39% and $2 million of revenue from GRAIL. For the third quarter, GAAP net income was $317 million or $2.08 per diluted share, which included a $900 million gain from our previously held investment in GRAIL, as a part of the acquisition, and $654 million in day one compensation expense related to the GRAIL acquisition. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $221 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, which included $0.19 of dilution from GRAIL operating losses and $0.06 of incremental dilution from the $9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition.  Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $153 million. Moving to the rest of the consolidated P&L. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million increased $57 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses of $50 million for the quarter and a $7 million increase in Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to a $163 million year-over-year, driven by $50 million of GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses and a $113 million increase in core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses.  Non-GAAP other expense of $6 million increased $4 million sequentially and was $13 million lower than other income in Q3 of last year as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio and subsequently liquidated our holdings to fund the GRAIL acquisition. As well as interest expense on the term notes issued in Q1 2021. The non-GAAP tax rate of 13.2% decreased from last quarter and year-over-year due to the tax impact of including GRAIL in Illumina's consolidated results of operations.  The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2020, related to prior-year return adjust and tax reserve releases. Moving to segment results, I will start by highlighting the financial results of Core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $1.106 billion, driven by record shipments for both clinical and research. Core Illumina sequencing revenue of $1.013 billion grew 43% year-over-year and represented 92% of Core Illumina revenue. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $723 million, led by record NovaSeq consumable shipments that grew over 50% year-over-year.  Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina grew 65% year-over-year to $180 million driven by record NovaSeq shipments that again more than doubled year-over-year due to accelerating demand in oncology testing. NextSeq 1,000 and 2,000 orders reached a new high in the quarter. And there was solid growth across all mid and low throughput systems year-over-year. We ended the quarter with record sequencing instrument backlog that is almost doubled the backlog entering the year. Revenue from COVID-19 surveillance again exceeded our expectations due to the sustained focus on variant tracking and surveillance infrastructure scaling in the quarter, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $15 million in incremental instrument revenue.  Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $110 million, driven by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as GEL sample growth. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $581 million, growing 33% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record oncology testing shipments and ongoing population genomics initiatives such as all of us. The regional performance was also driven by COVID surveillance strength due to expanded Public Health Network Adoption of NGS in Latin America.  EMEA delivered revenue of $313 million, representing 47% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by significant growth across all clinical markets and strength in emerging markets. Population genomics initiatives partially driven by UK Biobank, which concluded in Q3. And COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong Third Quarter performance in the region. Greater China revenue was a $122 million representing growth of 47% year-over-year due to continued clinical strength in the region led by NextSeqDx demand and hospitals and oncology testing [Indiscernible]. Almost half of the NextSeqDx shipments for the new to Illumina hospital customers.  And the expanding footprint in hospitals is helping drive growth in infectious disease testing, which more than doubled year-over-year. Finally, APJ revenue of $90 million grew 45% year-over-year, driven by sequencing instrument growth from clinical demand for NextSeq 2000, as well as consumables revenue growth across oncology testing and research. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 71.3% declined sequentially by 50 basis points due primarily to one-time revenue from the NIPT patent litigation settlement recorded in the prior quarter.  On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 390 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $478 million were up $7 million sequentially, but overall were lower than expected due to the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q4. As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $113 million year-over-year due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth, as well as additional investments to support the significant growth of our business. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 28%, compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins declined sequentially as expected, mostly due to $20 million of one-time patent litigation settlement revenue recognized in the prior quarter. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $2 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Gallery test fees. The multi-cancer early detection tests that commercially launched in June, as well as moderate MRD partnership revenue. GRAIL, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $50 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. As a reminder, GRAIL's third quarter financial results are for the period beginning after the acquisition closed on August 18.  Moving to cash flow and Balance sheet items for consolidated Illumina. Cash flow used in operations was $272 million, which was an outflow for the quarter due to expenses related to the GRAIL acquisition. DSO of 50 days compared to 44 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Third quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was a negative $324 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, bank balance and [Indiscernible] investments. During the third quarter, we used $2.9 billion to fund the GRAIL acquisition.  Before I discuss guidance, I wanted to acknowledge that I'm especially proud of our team's strong execution to fulfill surging demand and deliver another record quarter and a challenging global environment. While there were some small pockets of supply constraints for certain products and specific geographies this quarter. There was no material impact thanks to our teams' incredible efforts. We will continue to source, produce and operate with agility to enable further growth and support our customers.  Moving now to 2021 guidance, we now expect full-year 2021 consolidated and Core Illumina revenue to grow approximately 36%. This represents consolidated revenue of approximately $4.41 billion for 2021, or revenue growth of approximately $1.17 billion compared to 2020, and an increase of approximately $100 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. For fiscal 2021, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 39% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our base business. We now expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be between 27.5% to 28%, which reflects our higher revenue expectations.  We expect Core Illumina operating expenses for Q4 2021 to increase by approximately $50 million compared to Q3 2021, due to the timing of expenses shifting from Q3 into Q4, increased investments to support the robust growth of our business, as well as expected payments in Q4 2021, related to certain partnerships. Our focus continues to be on improving the Core Illumina operating margin leverage over time. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings diluted share in the range of $5.50 to $5.60. Which includes dilution from GRAIL operating loss of approximately $1 and incremental dilution of $0.15 from the 9.8 million shares issued to fund the GRAIL acquisition. We now expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4.41 to $4.51. We now expect diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2021 to be approximately 151 million. For the Fourth Quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. And GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. We expect diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately $158 million. Now I will hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. Thank you, Dan this is Sam and hope you're doing well. Welcome back and good to have you on the call. So, for Q4, first of all, let me talk about the full year. We are as we talked about on the prepared remarks, Dan, we are raising our revenue guide to approximately 36%. For Q4, I think there's a couple of areas that you need to keep in mind. One is the conclusion of the UK Biobank initiatives. This has been an incredibly productive, incredibly, I would say, very important initiative from a population genomics standpoint that we talked a little bit about the outcomes from that and the next steps.  But that's will likely present $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind or reduction in terms of revenues in Q4 versus Q3. So that's one area. And then the second area, and I think you touched on that in your question with regards to COVID surveillance. So COVID surveillance has been strong for the year, we've seen obviously, with the continue -- with the pandemic, the way it is. But there's continued testing and sequencing of positive samples across the globe. For Q3, we have $55 million of COVID surveillance revenue in the quarter, that represented $15 million of instruments and $40 million of consumables.  For Q4, our expectation is that we will have $35 million of COVID surveillance revenue, which represents a modest amount of instrument revenues, about $5 million, and then approximately $30 million of COVID consumables. That represents, again, another $20 million reduction from Q3 into Q4. When we think about that sequential momentum, the core business is really strong, and when I say the core business, I mean our clinical business, research business, you heard comments from Bob around GRAIL, but there is that reduction associated with those two items, which is COVID surveillance as well as the UK Biobank concluding. Yes. So let me start by talking about Q4, Vijay, and we did talk about EPS guide of $0.35 to $0.45, non-GAAP EPS for Q4, including the effects of GRAIL. As I talked about it on the call, there are in Q4 -- there's $0.80 roughly of dilution a dollar for the year, but in Q4, about $0.80 related to GRAIL dilution. And then there is about $0.09 of dilution related to the weighted average share count as a result of the shares that we issued to finance the GRAIL acquisition. Those are specific to GRAIL that obviously impacts with $0.35 to $0.45 non-GAAP EPS for Q4.  In terms of the core Illumina business, I talked to -- to answer Dan's question, I talked a little bit about a couple of dynamics around revenues. In terms of Opex, yes, there are some costs that I also mentioned in our prepared remarks. First of all, we have timing of expenses that shifted from Q3 to Q4, that's why Q3 was lower than our expectations in terms of operating expenses. Q4 and now has increased in terms of our expectations for spent there and then I talked about also partnership Opex that is expected in Q4.  So, we do have some expenditures associated with certain partnerships that somewhat significance in Q4, that's discrete to Q4. In terms of 2022 guidance, we're not going to talk about guidance on this call, except to say the fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong. We have talked before about the GRAIL dilution of $3.25 to $3.75 for 2022. That remains the case. That has not changed. But as you heard the backlog is very strong. In terms of instruments and the core fundamentals in terms of clinical and research are exceptionally strong. That's total dilution for GRAIL in 2022. That's not incremental, that's the total dilution that we expect, $3.25 to $3.75 impact on non-GAAP EPS in 2022. You're welcome There were a few fewer sequencing instruments that were placed in Q3 compared to Q2, so that had a little bit of an impact there as well. But in general, demand is exceptionally strong as we talked about, with doubling the NextSeq 2000, 1000, and 550 placements versus prior years, not just last year but prior, historically what we used to place in the mid throughput category and then the NovaSeq demand is exceptionally strong."

Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, representing 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing are expanding as reimbursement coverage increases, patient awareness grows and more sequencing applications enter the clinic. Ramping population sequencing programs are contributing to the robust growth in our research business. Additionally, genomic surveillance has emerged as a critical tool in the global fight against the pandemic, with over 70 countries now using Illumina platforms for COVID-19 surveillance. Looking forward, there is momentum for this global surveillance infrastructure to be the backbone of a durable, global genomic epidemiology capability to combat future outbreaks, including zoonotic transmissions, anti-microbial resistance, and bioterrorism. Q2 was the second consecutive quarter of record instrument sales, with revenue up 113% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with the highest instrument backlog since launching NovaSeq. Now looking at our performance by platform. Our high throughput portfolio continued its spectacular run, with NovaSeq achieving its highest order volume since launch in Q1 2017. Demand for high-throughput sequencing capacity continues to expand, with over half of the orders in Q2 coming from customers who are new to high-throughput. Additionally, our customers are continuing to use these systems at a high rate to meet demand in oncology testing, genetic disease testing, and population sequencing programs. Our mid-throughput platforms continue to drive growth with record placements in Q2. The strength of the NextSeq 2000, with almost 3 times the output of NextSeq 550, is enabling exciting new applications for customers like Cold Spring Harbor Labs in single cell analysis. Clinical customers drove new NextSeq 550 placements. NextSeq Dx again set a record for shipments as we see a trend toward decentralization of clinical sequencing outside the U.S. Benchtop platforms also had an excellent quarter, with instrument revenue up over 50% year-over-year. We shipped more MiSeq instruments this quarter than any prior quarter in the last five years. This record demand has been driven by our core business as well as emerging areas like preimplantation genetic screening and COVID surveillance. Turning to our Clinical and Research and Applied segments; sequencing consumables revenue of $704 million was up 82% year-over-year, driven by demand in both our Clinical and our Research segments. Starting with our Clinical business, our focus on market access and collaborations are expanding reimbursement, powering new and existing testing providers, and benefiting patients around the world. There are now over 1 billion covered lives globally across NIPT, WGS for RUGD, and CGP in oncology, demonstrating the expertise and impact of Illumina\u2019s market access team to drive coverage, and also the enormous opportunity in our clinical segment. Oncology testing, our largest market segment, recorded its third consecutive quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth as our customers announced additional offerings for therapy selection and MRD tests. In therapy selection, expanding reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiling is fueling the shift from small to large panels. With 74% of lives now covered for CGP in the U.S. and additional indications approved, new customers are entering the oncology testing field and existing customers, like Caris, are expanding their footprint. TruSight Oncology 500, Illumina\u2019s RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, achieved its 100,000th sample milestone in Q2, and added over 40 additional customers so far this year across 23 countries. In addition, over the last year, MRD testing has emerged as a key driver of future growth in the oncology segment, with positive reimbursement decisions, more customers, and multiple approaches entering the market. It\u2019s also exciting to see pharma invest in MRD based clinical trials to bring proven drugs to early-stage disease and improve patient outcomes. Reproductive health consumables shipments continued to benefit from the revised ACOG guidelines. In January, we expected that NIPT would be covered for approximately 3 million pregnancies in the U.S. by the end of 2021. We have already surpassed that milestone and we expect coverage to continue to expand. We\u2019re also making progress outside the U.S. to ensure all expecting families have access to NIPT. In Germany for example, national coverage will be implemented in 2022. Additionally, we are seeing continued growth from our CE-IVD marked VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and Asia. In Q2, Next Generation Genomic in Thailand adopted our VeriSeq NIPT Solution version 2, broadening access to expanded NIPT for expectant parents in Southeast Asia. Genetic disease testing delivered another outstanding quarter driven by reimbursement coverage increasing across Europe and lower sequencing prices enabling an accelerated shift from exomes to genomes. In the quarter, we also saw promising research and guidelines recognizing the diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of whole genome sequencing for genetic disease. In June, Rady Children\u2019s Hospital and the State of California published the results of Project Baby Bear, a groundbreaking program that showcases the significant benefits of rapid whole genome sequencing in decreasing both time to diagnosis and healthcare spending for critically-ill infants. More than 30% of these patients had a change of care due to the diagnosis enabled by WGS. This rapid whole genome sequencing protocol is now available through Rady\u2019s growing network of over 60 hospital partners as well as other hospital networks across the country. Turning to our Research and Applied segments, we saw strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Momentum from population genomics programs continued to grow in Q2. In the U.S., All of Us is now operating at full scale running thousands of genomes a week. We also saw multiple initiatives ramp internationally, providing an on-going pipeline of new PopGen opportunities. We expect revenue from over 30 different PopGen initiatives in the second half of the year. Multi-omic, spatial, and single cell approaches are gaining traction in many our research segments, driving high intensity sequencing. The success of Illumina\u2019s partnerships with companies such as Olink, Nanostring, and 10x will enable novel discoveries and expanded applications to enter the clinic. The emergence of the delta variant has renewed focus on and heightened awareness for genomic surveillance in the fight against COVID-19 and future pathogens. The launch of the RUO 96-sample COVIDSeq assay and the expanded EUA for COVIDSeq on NextSeq 2000 this quarter demonstrate our continued commitment to provide the workflows, instruments, and bioinformatics to meet this challenge. We are now working with governments and testing labs on COVID surveillance initiatives in over 70 countries. These efforts have driven increased COVID consumable revenue in Q2 relative to Q1 and at this time we expect the consumable revenue in the second half to remain relatively steady to the first half. Through our philanthropic efforts, we are working to ensure that countries with high needs for COVID surveillance with limited resources also have access to our sequencers and consumables. Earlier this week we announced a donation of $1 million in sequencing capabilities, including two NextSeq 2000s, to the Molecular Diagnostic Reference Laboratory at Kasturba Hospital. This will enable COVID surveillance in Mumbai, an epicenter of India\u2019s devasting second wave. Before I hand the call over to Sam, I\u2019ll provide a brief update on GRAIL. In Q2 GRAIL launched the first of its kind multi-cancer screening test, Galleri. We made this test available to our employees and are encouraged by the positive feedback we\u2019ve received. It is exciting to see the promise of genomics come to fruition in oncology screening, and we are committed to supporting all companies innovating in this space. As we shared in late July, we remain committed to closing this pro-competitive deal and believe with this acquisition, Illumina will be uniquely positioned to help save tens of thousands of lives. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sam.\nSam Samad: As Francis outlined, second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations, growing 78% year-over-year to $1.126 billion, driven by 80% growth in sequencing and 57% growth in microarrays. For the first time in company history, total quarter sequencing revenue exceeded $1 billion, growing 4% sequentially to $1.021 billion and representing 91% of total revenue. Our core business continued to accelerate across all regions in the quarter driven by growth in clinical, as well as strong demand from our research customers who were particularly impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 and are continuing to resume and expand their sequencing. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 82% year-over-year to $704 million, led by record NovaSeq consumables shipments, with robust demand driven by V1.5 flow cells. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $189 million, reflecting another quarter of significant strength across all instrument categories. NovaSeq shipments more than doubled from the second quarter of 2020, driven by continued adoption by new to high-throughput customers. Mid-throughput system shipments reached a new high, driven by record NextSeqDx shipments and demand for NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Since launch, 25% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 have been shipped to new-to-Illumina customers. Revenue contributions from COVID-19 surveillance testing exceeded our expectations, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $20 million in incremental instrument revenue. Sequencing service and other revenue was also higher than expected, growing 41% year-over-year to $128 million, primarily due to approximately $20 million of one-time revenue recognized from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement. Moving to regional results, revenue for the Americas region was $589 million, growing 76% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record sequencing product revenue related to demand for clinical oncology testing and genetic disease testing. The regional performance was also driven by strength in genetic disease research from population genomic initiatives, as well as contributions from COVID surveillance testing. EMEA delivered revenue of $320 million, representing 90% growth year-over-year. EMEA\u2019s performance was driven by both a recovery in research and an acceleration of the clinical business, including a record quarter for genetic disease testing, due to momentum from expanded market access and reimbursement. COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong performance in the region. Greater China revenue was $132 million, representing growth of 67% year-over-year due to continued strength in sequencing led by clinical growth in the region. Sequencing instrument shipments more than doubled year-over year driven by growing demand for NextSeqDx in hospitals, given the superior ease of use, accuracy, and quality of outputs from Illumina sequencers. Finally, APJ revenue of $85 million grew 67% year-over-year, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth across clinical applications in Reproductive Health and Genetic Disease Testing, as well as strong utilization by research customers. As expected, APJ revenue decreased sequentially due to timing of fiscal year-end purchases and normal seasonality in Japan in the first quarter of 2021. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today\u2019s release and the supplementary data available on our website. Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.8% improved sequentially by 130 basis points, mainly due to favorable utilization on strong demand as well as one-time revenue from a patent litigation settlement. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 320 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, as well as a positive impact from the patent litigation settlement, partially offset by product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $471 million increased $51 million sequentially due to higher compensation related expenses and increased project related spend but were lower than expected due to the timing of certain investments shifting to the second half of 2021. As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $137 million year-over-year, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth, as well as additional investments to support the growth of our business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.0%, compared to 32.1% in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenues and favorable gross margin, driven by higher volumes and the one-time patent litigation settlement. Non-GAAP other expense of $2 million was flat sequentially and $15 million lower year-over-year, as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate of 17.9% decreased from last quarter due to a tax expense recognized in the first quarter of 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was due to a higher mix of earnings in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate. For the second quarter, GAAP net income was $185 million or $1.26 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $276 million, or $1.87 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items, cash flow from operations was $253 million, which included $105 million in continuation payments made to Grail pursuant to the merger agreement. DSO of 44 days compared to 43 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Second quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $44 million and free cash flow was $209 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we used $491 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2021 convertible notes, which matured in June. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance, we now expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 32% to 34% or $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion. At the mid-point, this represents an increase of approximately $1.07 billion compared to 2020. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect, total sequencing revenue to grow approximately 35% year-over-year driven by accelerating strength in our core business and higher than expected contributions from COVID surveillance testing. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27.5% reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to continued innovation in R&D. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase approximately 200 to 250 basis points from the prior year, which is higher than our previous expectations. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.50, and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.69 to $4.89. Moving to the third quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to increase approximately 30% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35, and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Sam. It is clear from our strong first half results that Illumina, and our customers, are firing on all cylinders. Our clinical markets are all growing as expanded reimbursement gives more patients access to existing genomic tests, and evidence generation brings new genomic applications into the clinic. In oncology, more cancer patients have access to CGP for therapy selection. And emerging MRD and early cancer detection tests will drive significant long-term growth for sequencing. In genetic disease testing, the speed to diagnosis and treatment benefits that rapid WGS offers is catalyzing awareness and adoption. In NIPT, while coverage has expanded dramatically in the U.S., there is still a significant need internationally representing a tremendous growth opportunity. Research funding and overall investor capital deployment in life sciences continues to be incredibly robust, which will drive innovation and new use cases for sequencing for decades to come. Single-cell, spatial and multi-omic approaches to complex problems are driving larger scale, novel research and clinical solutions. The benefit of population genomics programs in national health systems is driving more governments to take up these initiatives further broadening the reach of sequencing across the globe. COVID surveillance initiatives are laying the foundation for a permanent, global genomic epidemiology infrastructure. Illumina is playing a central role in these advancements in genomics and human health. I am very proud of the execution of our fantastic teams around the world. This is an incredible time for our field, and we have the most exciting technology road map in development that I\u2019ve seen in my time at the company. I am honored to work alongside my colleagues to fulfill Illumina\u2019s instrumental role in improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. Now, I\u2019ll invite the operator to open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Speakers, our first question is from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on the solid results and thanks for taking my question. Francis, maybe if I could start with one on the guidance question here. Your second half revenue growth, the implied revenue growth ended about 20%. Comps only get about 500 basis points harder. In the context of you speaking about record backlog of instruments, opportunities on the surveillance side, et cetera, maybe talk about the second half revenue trajectory and why perhaps it shouldn't be stronger.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So thank you Vijay for that question. So I'll start by saying, we are seeing tremendous momentum in the business as you point out. If you look at every part of our business, we're seeing the businesses \u2013 those market segments expand. And so we expect that to continue going into the second half of the year, but there are a number of things that we are watching for; one, and Sam will add more color on this, but there are a number of one-time things that happened in Q1 that we don't expect to repeat in Q2 and we'll sort of list what they are. And then the second thing that's playing out is, look, we're still in the midst of the pandemic. And so we are keeping a watchful eye to see how the Delta variant plays out both here in the U.S. and around the world. And so that allows \u2013 that means we should put some moderation in terms of what we expect to see for the second half. We're definitely still in the middle of the pandemic. And those are the two factors I'd say that counterbalance would we see as incredible momentum in the markets that we're in.\nSam Samad: Yes. Vijay, maybe I could add just some more specificity on the one-time factors in the first half. And thank you for the question by the way. Our business is really strong and really accelerating across the core markets. They're all one-time factors in the first half that I do want to call out that are important when you think about the second half. So the one-time factors I would bucket as follows. You have in Q1, we had about $20 million of stocking. We did not see any stocking in the second quarter, but we did have $20 million in the first quarter. I would characterize roughly $55 million of COVID surveillance instruments placements, so that's $55 million in the first half. Now we\u2019re not expecting to repeat in the second half, so that's another item. There's the UK Biobank, which terminates and basically wrapped up in the third quarter. So that's about $30 million of extra revenues use in the first half that we will not have in the second half. And then finally, there's a $20 million NIPT settlement in the second quarter that I referred to in my prepared remarks that will not repeat in the second half. So if you put all these together, it's about $125 million of what I would call one-time factors in the first half that don't repeat. If you exclude those from the first half and annualize, it's basically we're looking at flattish second half versus first half.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Sam. And Francis, maybe if I could one on, the comment on utilization picking up in the box is interesting. Given these record placements and healthy in markets, budget-free outlooks, how should we think about fiscal 2022, does comps matter or perhaps this uptick in MRD and utilization comments, should we draw a correlation on what the consumable outflow could look like here?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So I'll start by saying, as you know, we're not ready to make statements about 2022, but I'll give you more color on the trends we are seeing. As you point out, we're seeing really strong instrument side across the portfolio. And what's especially exciting about that is that instruments tend to be a lead indicator on the business because of the model that we employ. And if you look at what I said about instruments, we have the highest overall backlog for instruments since we launched NovaSeq. On the high-throughput side, we have the highest order volume for NovaSeq since we launched the product in Q1 2017. On the mid-throughput side, we're on track to almost double the number of NextSeq that we ship if you look at the average we ship for the last few years. So really strong momentum in the mid-throughput portfolio. And then even at the low-end, as I pointed out in the remarks, we've got the highest MiSeq shipment of any quarter in the last. So, low-throughput, mid-throughput, high-throughput, all of those businesses are showing real momentum resulting in the big backlog that we have going into the second half of the year.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nDoug Schenkel: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. First thing I'm going to talk about is GRAIL. So recognizing what you talked about in your prepared remarks that you remain committed to GRAIL. I think it's fair and not controversial to say this process is clearly not going the way you expected it to. And unfortunately this happened in a different way, but recently with PacBio of course you know. So really kind of a three-parter here. One, it seems like the best in the EU regulators, tactically could really drag out this process if they want to, and in a way try to run out the clock over a one- to two-year period. I know that's not what you expect to happen or hope to happen, but if that does, are you willing to stick with this well into 2022? And then secondly, if this doesn't go through, is the conclusion that effectively Illumina can\u2019t acquire any service most company that is Illumina sequencing dependent? And then third, what do you think you could be doing better with your regulatory evaluation process moving forward? And how are you changing your approach?\nFrancis deSouza: Great. I think I have all those questions. So thank you, Doug, for those questions. So, first question is if \u2013 are we willing to stick with this, and does it look like the process is going to run out the clock. So the way the timing is going to work is the deal contract lasts till December 20. And so we are working both the FTC and the European Commission to get approval by that timeframe. At this point, there's those processes in work, there's the work we're doing with the FTC, there's the work we're doing with the European Commission in Phase 2 review, and there's the work we're doing in Luxembourg to dismiss the European case because of jurisdiction. At this point, it is possible that all of those land one way or another by December 20. And so at this point, we're not yet at the stage where the clock has run out. And at this stage, we are committed to working through this period to get this to a conclusion. We continue to believe that this deal is pro-competitive. We continue to believe that this deal will result in the savings of tens of thousands of lives that would not be saved if we didn't buy GRAIL just simply because we can accelerate the business. So to answer the question, we are committed to working through this deal, through that timeframe, through the end of the year. I would not read this to mean that we can't buy any other services provider or anything else we want to buy. We have done a number of other acquisitions in the last 18 months. So those have gone through. And I think we are going to continue to look for things that we believe add long-term shareholder value. And if it means we need to acquire them, we will continue to look for those from time to time. In terms of what we can do better, one of the things we\u2019ve learned is, we clearly \u2013 we don't have a D.C. presence and we don't have employees on the hill that are telling the Illumina story to the various agencies to the other folks on the hill. And it's become clear to us that we need a bigger presence there and so we're starting to build our presence there. And the fantastic thing is, and I personally have spent a lot more time over the hill \u2013 on the hill in the last couple of months, and the story really resonates. And so when we tell the story, I mean people get really behind it and want to support it. And so one of the things we have learned and we're going to do differently is we going to have more of a presence on the hill, and we're going to be telling the Illumina story more often and more clearly.\nDoug Schenkel: And then thank you for that, Francis. And let me ask one, it's kind of a longer-term one. Recognizing what we've seen in terms of recent acquisitions in the space and some of the new public entrance in sequencing. It seems fair to say that over the next few years, competitive dynamics are going to intensify a bit in sequencing. There's going to be more short read platforms. There's going to be advancement in long read tools. We're seeing that already. And I think you appreciate and I try to say this in the humblest way possible that coming from somebody that's focused a lot on sequencing over the last 15 years and has seen a lot of planned technological threats come and go, for me to kind of look at the landscape and conclude that, hey, maybe this feels a little bit different now, maybe it means something. So as you kind of think about that and really think about the next few years, is the playbook the same? New instruments maybe as soon as next year from top to bottom of the market? More flow cell density and essentially play the same elasticity curve the same way you have in the past, or as we think the next few years is a little bit different? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: All right. Another great question. So let's talk about a couple of parts of the question. One is does it feel like the competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore is the playbook the same in terms of competing here? And so let's go through each part. One, I\u2019d say, look, and you will appreciate this given the 15 years you've been looking at this, is we've always had waves of competition, right? And a few years ago we'd be talking about Qiagen and Thermo and we were coming from behind in some markets. And so there have been \u2013 and because the market is so big and we're still at the very beginning of this giant market, we fully anticipate that it'll continue to attract a lot of venture investment. I mean, there are dozens of companies and we could have had this conversation anytime in the last decade. And I'd have told you, there are dozens of companies that are being funded to go after the sequencing space. So I don't especially see a difference in terms of the number of companies being started. The actual competitors showing up are different, obviously, every time. And I liked what you said in one of the notes I read from you, Doug, where you said the trail is literally the dead bodies of people whose sequencers look great on PowerPoint, but a couple of years away from launch could never get closer than that to launching. So we've seen that. Now we will see more competition though going forward, again, we expect that. The part of the playbook is the same, better, faster sequencing continue to be the gold standard for accuracy, continue to set a relentless space in terms of innovation that our competitors have to follow, continue to set the price point in the market that everybody else has to follow. Those parts of the competitive playbook will be the same. And another part will be the same as continue to just add more and more value to the sequencer so that our customers get. And you've seen us do that with etiquette, with the hardware acceleration, that's now built into a sequencer. You've seen us do that by expanding the bioinformatics pipeline that's now built into a sequencer. And so we continue to expand what it means to create a sequencer. And you remember the move we made from the output of our sequencers through our images, and then it became base call. And now from our sequencer you can get variants and that's unique in the market, and now we'll force everybody else to react to that. So you've got to add that secondary pipeline now to your sequencer to catch up to Illumina giving you variants. But some part of the playbook has changed. The genomics industry and Illumina's business is way more diversified than it's ever been, right. A few years ago we used to be targeting the research market, and it was really a single instrument, the HiSeq, and our GA before that. So you were selling sort of highest throughput sequencers into the REO, the research market. Today that's only one segment of our business, right. Our business is really diversified, almost 44%, 45% of our business comes from the clinical market, and the rest is research and applied. More than half our business comes from outside the U.S. And we have a lot of cleared end-to-end workflows into the market. And so as I look at the landscape, no single competitor out there matches all those segments of the business. And so each of them have their own different sort of playbook. In some cases, if you have to deliver cleared end-to-end workflows, in some cases it is a better, faster, cheaper. And so that's a different \u2013 I mean, there's no single competitor I can look at, Doug, and say that competitor is coming after most of our business.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. Next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Francis, back to the guidance question, just thinking about some of the gives and takes in the back half of the year on COVID specifically, as we think about some of the PopSeq programs, I'm wondering how you think about risks to those that are ongoing? And then on the surveillance side, you said last quarter, you weren't expecting any instruments. You actually did have some instruments this quarter. So what are the odds that you actually could be underestimating kind of the tail there on the instrument side around surveillance?\nFrancis deSouza: Okay. So let me \u2013 it\u2019s two parts of the question. Let me start with PopSeq and then let's go to COVID instruments. We are very happy with where we're with COVID \u2013 the PopSeq programs right now. I talked about the UK Biobank, is continuing to go full force. We expect it to sort of end towards the end of this year, but it's continuing to sequence at full production scale. All of us is now sequencing at full production scale. We talked about doing thousands of samples a week, and that pipeline seems really robust. And I don't expect much disruption over the course of the year, barring something massively unexpected for what's happening with all of us. So they're often running really well. Getting into that, it's really exciting about PopSeq is now we have 30 programs that are up and running around the world. And so that means we're starting to diversify the revenue contribution from the PopSeq programs as they start to wrap around the world. And that gives us I think a little bit more resilience in terms of, if any part of the world is more impacted than the other, there's still other parts that\u2019s protecting. I think it's a really healthy setup for us in terms of PopSeq for the rest of the year. In terms of COVID instruments, you're right; when I was here during this call a few months ago, I told you that we weren't expecting any more instruments in the year. We thought the buy was going to happen in Q1. And then behold, we told some instruments for COVID surveillance in Q2. Now that part of the business candidly Tycho is hard to predict. And so what we've built into the model is no more instruments for the rest of the year and $50 million to $60 million in terms of consumables. And, yes, absolutely, it's possible. We buy \u2013 people buy more instruments, but again, that's hard to predict.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. Next question is from the line of Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nTejas Savant: Hey, Francis. Good evening. I just want to follow-up quickly on PopSeq, and then I have a question on China. So on PopSeq, I mean, there's a little bit of a possibility of a delay here in terms of the MVP renewal. Obviously, that's been an important revenue generator for you over the years. What's the risk that it could be a bit of an air pocket here as some of your \u2013 with some of your larger customers heading into 2022? And then second on China, I mean, recently there was some news around new by Chinese targets issued by the government for hospital purchases. So any thoughts on that impacting your growth? Obviously, NextSeq Dx, following the regulatory approval, there has been important growth driver for you in that geography.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So thank you, Tejas. Let's go through the two questions. For the reasons I just talked about the fact that now we have a number of PopSeq programs that we have a number of the bigger ones that already running at scale. We feel really confident in the PopSeq pipeline and the revenue pipe for the rest of the year. And so we've looked at any of the risks associated them and looked at the timing, but we feel really confident that the diversity of the revenue sources in the PopGen pipeline. In terms of China, we were really happy with the performance we've been seeing out of China. We talked about the growth we're seeing in China. We are maintaining our leading position in China, our strategy that is really paying off. And it touches on the things you asked about. So we have always followed a strategy in China that was very partner centric. And so we have partners that are building their products on our instruments and selling them into customers. And those customers \u2013 those partners are Chinese partners. And so a lot of them are qualify even under the maiden China regulations and that puts us in a really good position in China. The other thing that \u2013 a couple of other things, when you touched on, which is the NovaSeqDx, again, sort of a partner model, but that is a \u2013 that's a really positive step forward for us in China and then the regulations around LDTs in China is also very positive in terms of what it means for the future. So we're happy with the growth where it's encouraged by, some of the things we're seeing in terms of pointing to positive momentum going forward.\nFrancis deSouza: And maybe one thing I would add on population genomics, with regards to the second half, but also on an ongoing basis going forward in 2022, the really exciting thing about population genomics initiatives now is what we talked about earlier, which is the 30 or so population genomics initiatives that are driving contribution in half of the year and beyond. So we are \u2013 I would say very diversified in that respect. In terms of the contribution spread across a number of them that are ongoing. Those are not ones that we are waiting to happen, but they are actually ongoing and starting to drive contribution. And we do have the large ones that we've talked about, one of which is the UK Biobank, which is wrapping up in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. Next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hey a couple of questions. I think the first one would be the instrument numbers are quite impressive and the backlog commentary likewise. Francis, what's your philosophy on new product introductions? I mean, it sounds like NovaSeq still has a lot of runway in it. And I know we've been, I know earlier \u2013 or I should say last year we were or was it earlier this year, and I remember we were talking about potential for the next generation of NovaSeq or something like that will be coming out and like that, what's your philosophy now on new product introductions, given the strength in the existing portfolio?\nFrancis deSouza: It's a great question. Some part of our philosophy Derik has not changed, but actually one part has, I'll tell you about both. The part that hasn't changed is, we will launch products into the market when we think the market is ready, meaning that ready to absorb the price point, we will unlock additional elasticity and grow the market as a whole. And so we continue to be in dialogue with our customers to try and understand where sort of the demand curve is. And when we feel that there is an opportunity to expand the market through the launch of an instrument with a certain price point or a certain capability, that's when we bring the product to market. So our technical teams are just constantly pushing the technology and then when we feel the market's ready we do the engineering to bring those technologies into [indiscernible] that part of the philosophy has not changed. And we're going to continue to watch when in the right time is to catalyze a segment of the market with a new product offering. What has changed actually, it's really interesting. It has been the result of watching what happened with NextSeq 1000, 2000. And what we have seen with NextSeq 1000, 2000 is that the 1,000 and 2,000 has dramatically expanded the mid-throughput market. And it wasn't just an upgrade or a replacement cycle. And it's quite dramatic actually. If you look at the number of mid-throughput instruments we shipped over the last few years, it's been fairly steady. This year, we are on track to almost double that number. And there are lots of people who are still buying NextSeq 550Dx. What's happening is we've catalyzed and open up new markets for the mid-throughput instrument with the price points that we've put out with the 1,000 and 2,000. And that's different in the genomics market has been before. And so now we see an opportunity even in a market segment to not just catalyze an upgrade cycle, but actually to open up other parts of that segment with an offering in that market segment. And so that's a different philosophy that we're building into now our strategies as we think about future products.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. That's really helpful. Sam, you didn't give us any sort of like pull through ranges on the install base on your instruments. Could you share some color on that? Specifically what NovaSeq pull through was and the NextSeq pull through and MiSeq? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Sure. Derik. Yeah, happy to. With regards to NovaSeq, the last guidance that we shared was 1.1 million to 1.2 million for instruments that we said we were going to be on the high end of that range. So I can tell you that for Q2, we exceeded that. And now our expectation for the full year is that we will be above that range, the 1.1 million to 1.2 million, we're going to exceed that. So we're not giving an exact number, but we are going to be above that 1.2 million top-end. With regards to NextSeq, the pull through on NextSeq 550 at least, we haven't shared any pull through on NextSeq 2000 or 1000 too early right now in the life cycle of those instruments to provide that. But for NextSeq 550, whereas we're at the high end of that 100 to 150 range that we've positionally shared, so pull-through is at the high end of that. With regards to MiSeq, we are within the 40,000 to 45,000 pull-through range of that instrument. And with regards to MiniSeq we are within that \u2013 on the high-end of that 20,000 to 25,000 pull-through range for that instrument.\nDerik De Bruin: Great, thank you very much.\nSam Samad: You're welcome.\nOperator: Speakers, next question's from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDan Arias: Afternoon guys, thanks for the question. Francis, maybe just to your point on market readiness and just where your customer base is, do you have a read on what percentage of your NovaSeq seat base is taking advantage of the $600 genome capabilities at this point? I guess more importantly, can you share it if you do?\nFrancis deSouza: You know, that's a great question. I don't have any number to give you and say a specific percentage, but how would I think about it? I would say that, with the price reduction that they put into the market last summer, which catalyzed the elasticity we're seeing, the $600 genome is now pretty broadly available to our NovaSeq customer. So I would expect \u2013 a significant number of them are actually availing themselves at that price point. Now of course, you know that, not necessarily genomes that they're running NovaSeq are now used for a very broad range of applications, a lot of NovaSeq usage in oncology for the TSO 500 or some of these large panels, but I'd say a lot of them, a significant percentage of them are able to use those applications at that kind of price point, but I don't have an exact number to give you.\nDan Arias: Okay. maybe on the oncology side, some of the work that we had done, it showed a pretty strong response in terms of the usage of AmpliSeq for Illumina equipment, I'm guessing, or I'm wondering, I guess, how critical you see that partnership for your cancer franchise going forward, and then are there any margin implications that might be material enough to call out or that we should be mindful of there?\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah, the way I think about that is, it's a nice to have part of the portfolio. But it's not a critical part of the portfolio, in terms of even thinking about the revenue for us. I wouldn't do that as a big part of the revenue we make in the oncology business at all. The reason we did it, because we want to make sure that our customers can have the broadest options in terms of what they want to do, but it's not a meaningful contributor to our revenue in oncology\nOperator: Speakers, next question's from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Francis, might be per se I'm actually, I'm just wondering the cadence throughout the quarter, how things picked up and then particularly in the last couple of weeks or a quarter today here, have you seen any slowdown or kind of shutting down of customers in recent weeks due to Delta? Just trying to get a handle on lab activity as we tried to do the quarter and then again, particularly recently here?\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah. So I'll start with the easy part, but we are not seeing any slowdown right now, because of Delta, we're not seeing any shutdowns. The whole \u2013 was fast you know Patrick, I mean, you could see that in terms of DSO like you saw the improved linearity in this quarter, the way it felt internally is we started the quarter fast and it got faster. So it didn't, there was no slowdown in the middle. But what was surprising again, was it started really fast. So the hockey stick at the end I'd say was not necessarily as pronounced because we had a fast starting in the quarter.\nSam Samad: Yeah. When you think about, Patrick with regards to just one more point on your question, no we did not see that slowdown as Francis said, we are still in a COVID year and Delta is obviously still raising. So we still \u2013 when you think about the second half, we still obviously think about the potential impact of any shutdowns, et cetera. But at this point we're not seeing that and the quarter exited very strong as it started.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful. And then maybe just one on NextSeq and then that continues, we are seeing a record quarter after the record quarter there. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the clinical demand side there, how much it picked up this quarter versus last quarter and expectations going forward?\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah. I mean, that has been quite a remarkable story. I think I mentioned a few minutes ago that if you look at the number of instruments we're shipping in that segment it's now almost double what we shipped historically into that segment. So a few things I'll point out; one, we continue to ship 550 and 550Dx. So there are people who validated workflows on those instruments, they're continuing to buy. We are seeing a good number of new to Illumina and new to that segment customers come in. It continues to be on the clinical workhorses of our portfolio. And you see applications in oncology, you see applications in NIPT and that continues to be true. The things we talked about in terms of the expansion we're seeing in the clinical markets, all that reimbursement that kicked in last year for oncology, for NIPT, all of that is driving the instrument purchases we're seeing. And that's a really great sign because as we talked about instrument purchases for us are a lead indicator of future growth and so when you place that many instruments, it's exciting for us to think about and so those are some things that are driving.\nSam Samad: Maybe I can add a data points with regards to adoption and the split by customer type or not maybe customer type, but just in terms of where we're seeing the placements come from. We are seeing roughly 25% coming from new to Illumina customers into the NextSeq 2000 and 1000, which is really encouraging, basically expanding the pie in terms of new sales in our customers. We're also seeing roughly 30% coming from bank stuffed customers. So those customers that are either on MiSeq or MiniSeq that are now going up to the NextSeq 2000 and 1000, and we're seeing also capacity upgrades, as well as NextSeq 550 conversions going into NextSeq 2000 and 1000. But as we said as well, the NextSeq 550 and NextSeq 550Dx is really holding very strong with continued placements in those categories. What we are not seeing is HiSeq customers going really to NextSeq 2000 instead of NovaSeq. So that's something we always said we didn't expect, and we are not seeing if we're seeing only a really very, very small handful of customers having done that.\nOperator: Questions from the line of Kyle Mikson of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nKyle Mikson: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I'll just ask a few here for the sake of time and I will just go on mute. So the $19 million for CDC for the pathogen centers of excellence, I was wondering when that could be a tailwind for Illumina, just given the funding to expect in August 2022? And that's the first question. The second one I wanted to ask was about just a spatial and pretty on this readout. I'm just wondering if that's going to be like a material growth driver, I guess, going forward is that moving the needle, do you see that? And then also just on the piece on COVID surveillance testing and guidance for the second half of the year. I mean maybe Sam can just talk about that a bit. Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah. So let me \u2013 let me start and I'll turn it over to Sam. In terms of the CDC money and the American Rescue Plan Act and all that money where, we are watching to see how that money gets allocated out. We haven't really built much of that into our expectations the course of this year, because there's still work to be done in terms of how that money gets allocated out. We certainly expect some benefit from it going into the following years, but we haven't built that much in some colored more. Spatial and proteomics are definitely interesting, they are definitely emerging. They are maybe where single cell was a few years ago, single cell certainly a much bigger contributor of our business today than spatial or proteomics, but given the amount of interest in both, we do expect those to be growth drivers for our business going forward.\nSam Samad: So maybe first on the American Rescue Plan and some of the funding that went in there, the 1.7 billion with 400 million going into these centers of excellence out of which 90 million has now been allocated, but it will be a really decided in August of 2022, how that gets allocated. I think that's a more of a long-term benefit that we expect for the business. So that's the \u2013 what we expect will be the durable genomic epidemiology benefit, the infrastructure that gets built that we see as definitely a potential upside in future years, not this year. In terms of this year, Kyle, just to kind of script out what is the progression in terms of the guide. In Q1, we have 55 million with 35 million instruments, 20 million consumables. In Q2 we had 60 million with 20 million instruments and 40 million consumables and our expectation in the second half is that we have approximately 50 million to 60 million of sequencing consumables revenue in the second half. We look at it as equally split between Q3 and Q4. That is higher than what we had guided through on the Q1, call just driven off of the additional utilization and placements that we're seeing in the first half.\nOperator: Thank you, participants. I'll now hand the call back over to Illumina for final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you for the questions. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the investor section of our website. As well the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update call into close of third fiscal quarter of 2021.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered Q2 revenues of $1.126 billion, representing 78% year-over-year growth, significantly exceeding expectations across all geographic regions and market segments. Our clinical markets, including oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing are expanding as reimbursement coverage increases, patient awareness grows and more sequencing applications enter the clinic. Ramping population sequencing programs are contributing to the robust growth in our research business. Additionally, genomic surveillance has emerged as a critical tool in the global fight against the pandemic, with over 70 countries now using Illumina platforms for COVID-19 surveillance. Looking forward, there is momentum for this global surveillance infrastructure to be the backbone of a durable, global genomic epidemiology capability to combat future outbreaks, including zoonotic transmissions, anti-microbial resistance, and bioterrorism. Q2 was the second consecutive quarter of record instrument sales, with revenue up 113% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with the highest instrument backlog since launching NovaSeq. Now looking at our performance by platform. Our high throughput portfolio continued its spectacular run, with NovaSeq achieving its highest order volume since launch in Q1 2017. Demand for high-throughput sequencing capacity continues to expand, with over half of the orders in Q2 coming from customers who are new to high-throughput. Additionally, our customers are continuing to use these systems at a high rate to meet demand in oncology testing, genetic disease testing, and population sequencing programs. Our mid-throughput platforms continue to drive growth with record placements in Q2. The strength of the NextSeq 2000, with almost 3 times the output of NextSeq 550, is enabling exciting new applications for customers like Cold Spring Harbor Labs in single cell analysis. Clinical customers drove new NextSeq 550 placements. NextSeq Dx again set a record for shipments as we see a trend toward decentralization of clinical sequencing outside the U.S. Benchtop platforms also had an excellent quarter, with instrument revenue up over 50% year-over-year. We shipped more MiSeq instruments this quarter than any prior quarter in the last five years. This record demand has been driven by our core business as well as emerging areas like preimplantation genetic screening and COVID surveillance. Turning to our Clinical and Research and Applied segments; sequencing consumables revenue of $704 million was up 82% year-over-year, driven by demand in both our Clinical and our Research segments. Starting with our Clinical business, our focus on market access and collaborations are expanding reimbursement, powering new and existing testing providers, and benefiting patients around the world. There are now over 1 billion covered lives globally across NIPT, WGS for RUGD, and CGP in oncology, demonstrating the expertise and impact of Illumina's market access team to drive coverage, and also the enormous opportunity in our clinical segment. Oncology testing, our largest market segment, recorded its third consecutive quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth as our customers announced additional offerings for therapy selection and MRD tests. In therapy selection, expanding reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiling is fueling the shift from small to large panels. With 74% of lives now covered for CGP in the U.S. and additional indications approved, new customers are entering the oncology testing field and existing customers, like Caris, are expanding their footprint. TruSight Oncology 500, Illumina's RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, achieved its 100,000th sample milestone in Q2, and added over 40 additional customers so far this year across 23 countries. In addition, over the last year, MRD testing has emerged as a key driver of future growth in the oncology segment, with positive reimbursement decisions, more customers, and multiple approaches entering the market. It's also exciting to see pharma invest in MRD based clinical trials to bring proven drugs to early-stage disease and improve patient outcomes. Reproductive health consumables shipments continued to benefit from the revised ACOG guidelines. In January, we expected that NIPT would be covered for approximately 3 million pregnancies in the U.S. by the end of 2021. We have already surpassed that milestone and we expect coverage to continue to expand. We're also making progress outside the U.S. to ensure all expecting families have access to NIPT. In Germany for example, national coverage will be implemented in 2022. Additionally, we are seeing continued growth from our CE-IVD marked VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and Asia. In Q2, Next Generation Genomic in Thailand adopted our VeriSeq NIPT Solution version 2, broadening access to expanded NIPT for expectant parents in Southeast Asia. Genetic disease testing delivered another outstanding quarter driven by reimbursement coverage increasing across Europe and lower sequencing prices enabling an accelerated shift from exomes to genomes. In the quarter, we also saw promising research and guidelines recognizing the diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of whole genome sequencing for genetic disease. In June, Rady Children's Hospital and the State of California published the results of Project Baby Bear, a groundbreaking program that showcases the significant benefits of rapid whole genome sequencing in decreasing both time to diagnosis and healthcare spending for critically-ill infants. More than 30% of these patients had a change of care due to the diagnosis enabled by WGS. This rapid whole genome sequencing protocol is now available through Rady's growing network of over 60 hospital partners as well as other hospital networks across the country. Turning to our Research and Applied segments, we saw strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Momentum from population genomics programs continued to grow in Q2. In the U.S., All of Us is now operating at full scale running thousands of genomes a week. We also saw multiple initiatives ramp internationally, providing an on-going pipeline of new PopGen opportunities. We expect revenue from over 30 different PopGen initiatives in the second half of the year. Multi-omic, spatial, and single cell approaches are gaining traction in many our research segments, driving high intensity sequencing. The success of Illumina's partnerships with companies such as Olink, Nanostring, and 10x will enable novel discoveries and expanded applications to enter the clinic. The emergence of the delta variant has renewed focus on and heightened awareness for genomic surveillance in the fight against COVID-19 and future pathogens. The launch of the RUO 96-sample COVIDSeq assay and the expanded EUA for COVIDSeq on NextSeq 2000 this quarter demonstrate our continued commitment to provide the workflows, instruments, and bioinformatics to meet this challenge. We are now working with governments and testing labs on COVID surveillance initiatives in over 70 countries. These efforts have driven increased COVID consumable revenue in Q2 relative to Q1 and at this time we expect the consumable revenue in the second half to remain relatively steady to the first half. Through our philanthropic efforts, we are working to ensure that countries with high needs for COVID surveillance with limited resources also have access to our sequencers and consumables. Earlier this week we announced a donation of $1 million in sequencing capabilities, including two NextSeq 2000s, to the Molecular Diagnostic Reference Laboratory at Kasturba Hospital. This will enable COVID surveillance in Mumbai, an epicenter of India's devasting second wave. Before I hand the call over to Sam, I'll provide a brief update on GRAIL. In Q2 GRAIL launched the first of its kind multi-cancer screening test, Galleri. We made this test available to our employees and are encouraged by the positive feedback we've received. It is exciting to see the promise of genomics come to fruition in oncology screening, and we are committed to supporting all companies innovating in this space. As we shared in late July, we remain committed to closing this pro-competitive deal and believe with this acquisition, Illumina will be uniquely positioned to help save tens of thousands of lives. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sam. Thank you, Sam. It is clear from our strong first half results that Illumina, and our customers, are firing on all cylinders. Our clinical markets are all growing as expanded reimbursement gives more patients access to existing genomic tests, and evidence generation brings new genomic applications into the clinic. In oncology, more cancer patients have access to CGP for therapy selection. And emerging MRD and early cancer detection tests will drive significant long-term growth for sequencing. In genetic disease testing, the speed to diagnosis and treatment benefits that rapid WGS offers is catalyzing awareness and adoption. In NIPT, while coverage has expanded dramatically in the U.S., there is still a significant need internationally representing a tremendous growth opportunity. Research funding and overall investor capital deployment in life sciences continues to be incredibly robust, which will drive innovation and new use cases for sequencing for decades to come. Single-cell, spatial and multi-omic approaches to complex problems are driving larger scale, novel research and clinical solutions. The benefit of population genomics programs in national health systems is driving more governments to take up these initiatives further broadening the reach of sequencing across the globe. COVID surveillance initiatives are laying the foundation for a permanent, global genomic epidemiology infrastructure. Illumina is playing a central role in these advancements in genomics and human health. I am very proud of the execution of our fantastic teams around the world. This is an incredible time for our field, and we have the most exciting technology road map in development that I've seen in my time at the company. I am honored to work alongside my colleagues to fulfill Illumina's instrumental role in improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. Now, I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A. Yes. So thank you Vijay for that question. So I'll start by saying, we are seeing tremendous momentum in the business as you point out. If you look at every part of our business, we're seeing the businesses \u2013 those market segments expand. And so we expect that to continue going into the second half of the year, but there are a number of things that we are watching for; one, and Sam will add more color on this, but there are a number of one-time things that happened in Q1 that we don't expect to repeat in Q2 and we'll sort of list what they are. And then the second thing that's playing out is, look, we're still in the midst of the pandemic. And so we are keeping a watchful eye to see how the Delta variant plays out both here in the U.S. and around the world. And so that allows \u2013 that means we should put some moderation in terms of what we expect to see for the second half. We're definitely still in the middle of the pandemic. And those are the two factors I'd say that counterbalance would we see as incredible momentum in the markets that we're in. Yes. So I'll start by saying, as you know, we're not ready to make statements about 2022, but I'll give you more color on the trends we are seeing. As you point out, we're seeing really strong instrument side across the portfolio. And what's especially exciting about that is that instruments tend to be a lead indicator on the business because of the model that we employ. And if you look at what I said about instruments, we have the highest overall backlog for instruments since we launched NovaSeq. On the high-throughput side, we have the highest order volume for NovaSeq since we launched the product in Q1 2017. On the mid-throughput side, we're on track to almost double the number of NextSeq that we ship if you look at the average we ship for the last few years. So really strong momentum in the mid-throughput portfolio. And then even at the low-end, as I pointed out in the remarks, we've got the highest MiSeq shipment of any quarter in the last. So, low-throughput, mid-throughput, high-throughput, all of those businesses are showing real momentum resulting in the big backlog that we have going into the second half of the year. Great. I think I have all those questions. So thank you, Doug, for those questions. So, first question is if \u2013 are we willing to stick with this, and does it look like the process is going to run out the clock. So the way the timing is going to work is the deal contract lasts till December 20. And so we are working both the FTC and the European Commission to get approval by that timeframe. At this point, there's those processes in work, there's the work we're doing with the FTC, there's the work we're doing with the European Commission in Phase 2 review, and there's the work we're doing in Luxembourg to dismiss the European case because of jurisdiction. At this point, it is possible that all of those land one way or another by December 20. And so at this point, we're not yet at the stage where the clock has run out. And at this stage, we are committed to working through this period to get this to a conclusion. We continue to believe that this deal is pro-competitive. We continue to believe that this deal will result in the savings of tens of thousands of lives that would not be saved if we didn't buy GRAIL just simply because we can accelerate the business. So to answer the question, we are committed to working through this deal, through that timeframe, through the end of the year. I would not read this to mean that we can't buy any other services provider or anything else we want to buy. We have done a number of other acquisitions in the last 18 months. So those have gone through. And I think we are going to continue to look for things that we believe add long-term shareholder value. And if it means we need to acquire them, we will continue to look for those from time to time. In terms of what we can do better, one of the things we've learned is, we clearly \u2013 we don't have a D.C. presence and we don't have employees on the hill that are telling the Illumina story to the various agencies to the other folks on the hill. And it's become clear to us that we need a bigger presence there and so we're starting to build our presence there. And the fantastic thing is, and I personally have spent a lot more time over the hill \u2013 on the hill in the last couple of months, and the story really resonates. And so when we tell the story, I mean people get really behind it and want to support it. And so one of the things we have learned and we're going to do differently is we going to have more of a presence on the hill, and we're going to be telling the Illumina story more often and more clearly. All right. Another great question. So let's talk about a couple of parts of the question. One is does it feel like the competition is intensifying right now in a way that it wasn't before? And two, so therefore is the playbook the same in terms of competing here? And so let's go through each part. One, I'd say, look, and you will appreciate this given the 15 years you've been looking at this, is we've always had waves of competition, right? And a few years ago we'd be talking about Qiagen and Thermo and we were coming from behind in some markets. And so there have been \u2013 and because the market is so big and we're still at the very beginning of this giant market, we fully anticipate that it'll continue to attract a lot of venture investment. I mean, there are dozens of companies and we could have had this conversation anytime in the last decade. And I'd have told you, there are dozens of companies that are being funded to go after the sequencing space. So I don't especially see a difference in terms of the number of companies being started. The actual competitors showing up are different, obviously, every time. And I liked what you said in one of the notes I read from you, Doug, where you said the trail is literally the dead bodies of people whose sequencers look great on PowerPoint, but a couple of years away from launch could never get closer than that to launching. So we've seen that. Now we will see more competition though going forward, again, we expect that. The part of the playbook is the same, better, faster sequencing continue to be the gold standard for accuracy, continue to set a relentless space in terms of innovation that our competitors have to follow, continue to set the price point in the market that everybody else has to follow. Those parts of the competitive playbook will be the same. And another part will be the same as continue to just add more and more value to the sequencer so that our customers get. And you've seen us do that with etiquette, with the hardware acceleration, that's now built into a sequencer. You've seen us do that by expanding the bioinformatics pipeline that's now built into a sequencer. And so we continue to expand what it means to create a sequencer. And you remember the move we made from the output of our sequencers through our images, and then it became base call. And now from our sequencer you can get variants and that's unique in the market, and now we'll force everybody else to react to that. So you've got to add that secondary pipeline now to your sequencer to catch up to Illumina giving you variants. But some part of the playbook has changed. The genomics industry and Illumina's business is way more diversified than it's ever been, right. A few years ago we used to be targeting the research market, and it was really a single instrument, the HiSeq, and our GA before that. So you were selling sort of highest throughput sequencers into the REO, the research market. Today that's only one segment of our business, right. Our business is really diversified, almost 44%, 45% of our business comes from the clinical market, and the rest is research and applied. More than half our business comes from outside the U.S. And we have a lot of cleared end-to-end workflows into the market. And so as I look at the landscape, no single competitor out there matches all those segments of the business. And so each of them have their own different sort of playbook. In some cases, if you have to deliver cleared end-to-end workflows, in some cases it is a better, faster, cheaper. And so that's a different \u2013 I mean, there's no single competitor I can look at, Doug, and say that competitor is coming after most of our business. Okay. So let me \u2013 it's two parts of the question. Let me start with PopSeq and then let's go to COVID instruments. We are very happy with where we're with COVID \u2013 the PopSeq programs right now. I talked about the UK Biobank, is continuing to go full force. We expect it to sort of end towards the end of this year, but it's continuing to sequence at full production scale. All of us is now sequencing at full production scale. We talked about doing thousands of samples a week, and that pipeline seems really robust. And I don't expect much disruption over the course of the year, barring something massively unexpected for what's happening with all of us. So they're often running really well. Getting into that, it's really exciting about PopSeq is now we have 30 programs that are up and running around the world. And so that means we're starting to diversify the revenue contribution from the PopSeq programs as they start to wrap around the world. And that gives us I think a little bit more resilience in terms of, if any part of the world is more impacted than the other, there's still other parts that's protecting. I think it's a really healthy setup for us in terms of PopSeq for the rest of the year. In terms of COVID instruments, you're right; when I was here during this call a few months ago, I told you that we weren't expecting any more instruments in the year. We thought the buy was going to happen in Q1. And then behold, we told some instruments for COVID surveillance in Q2. Now that part of the business candidly Tycho is hard to predict. And so what we've built into the model is no more instruments for the rest of the year and $50 million to $60 million in terms of consumables. And, yes, absolutely, it's possible. We buy \u2013 people buy more instruments, but again, that's hard to predict. Yes. So thank you, Tejas. Let's go through the two questions. For the reasons I just talked about the fact that now we have a number of PopSeq programs that we have a number of the bigger ones that already running at scale. We feel really confident in the PopSeq pipeline and the revenue pipe for the rest of the year. And so we've looked at any of the risks associated them and looked at the timing, but we feel really confident that the diversity of the revenue sources in the PopGen pipeline. In terms of China, we were really happy with the performance we've been seeing out of China. We talked about the growth we're seeing in China. We are maintaining our leading position in China, our strategy that is really paying off. And it touches on the things you asked about. So we have always followed a strategy in China that was very partner centric. And so we have partners that are building their products on our instruments and selling them into customers. And those customers \u2013 those partners are Chinese partners. And so a lot of them are qualify even under the maiden China regulations and that puts us in a really good position in China. The other thing that \u2013 a couple of other things, when you touched on, which is the NovaSeqDx, again, sort of a partner model, but that is a \u2013 that's a really positive step forward for us in China and then the regulations around LDTs in China is also very positive in terms of what it means for the future. So we're happy with the growth where it's encouraged by, some of the things we're seeing in terms of pointing to positive momentum going forward. And maybe one thing I would add on population genomics, with regards to the second half, but also on an ongoing basis going forward in 2022, the really exciting thing about population genomics initiatives now is what we talked about earlier, which is the 30 or so population genomics initiatives that are driving contribution in half of the year and beyond. So we are \u2013 I would say very diversified in that respect. In terms of the contribution spread across a number of them that are ongoing. Those are not ones that we are waiting to happen, but they are actually ongoing and starting to drive contribution. And we do have the large ones that we've talked about, one of which is the UK Biobank, which is wrapping up in the second half. It's a great question. Some part of our philosophy Derik has not changed, but actually one part has, I'll tell you about both. The part that hasn't changed is, we will launch products into the market when we think the market is ready, meaning that ready to absorb the price point, we will unlock additional elasticity and grow the market as a whole. And so we continue to be in dialogue with our customers to try and understand where sort of the demand curve is. And when we feel that there is an opportunity to expand the market through the launch of an instrument with a certain price point or a certain capability, that's when we bring the product to market. So our technical teams are just constantly pushing the technology and then when we feel the market's ready we do the engineering to bring those technologies into [indiscernible] that part of the philosophy has not changed. And we're going to continue to watch when in the right time is to catalyze a segment of the market with a new product offering. What has changed actually, it's really interesting. It has been the result of watching what happened with NextSeq 1000, 2000. And what we have seen with NextSeq 1000, 2000 is that the 1,000 and 2,000 has dramatically expanded the mid-throughput market. And it wasn't just an upgrade or a replacement cycle. And it's quite dramatic actually. If you look at the number of mid-throughput instruments we shipped over the last few years, it's been fairly steady. This year, we are on track to almost double that number. And there are lots of people who are still buying NextSeq 550Dx. What's happening is we've catalyzed and open up new markets for the mid-throughput instrument with the price points that we've put out with the 1,000 and 2,000. And that's different in the genomics market has been before. And so now we see an opportunity even in a market segment to not just catalyze an upgrade cycle, but actually to open up other parts of that segment with an offering in that market segment. And so that's a different philosophy that we're building into now our strategies as we think about future products. You know, that's a great question. I don't have any number to give you and say a specific percentage, but how would I think about it? I would say that, with the price reduction that they put into the market last summer, which catalyzed the elasticity we're seeing, the $600 genome is now pretty broadly available to our NovaSeq customer. So I would expect \u2013 a significant number of them are actually availing themselves at that price point. Now of course, you know that, not necessarily genomes that they're running NovaSeq are now used for a very broad range of applications, a lot of NovaSeq usage in oncology for the TSO 500 or some of these large panels, but I'd say a lot of them, a significant percentage of them are able to use those applications at that kind of price point, but I don't have an exact number to give you. Yeah, the way I think about that is, it's a nice to have part of the portfolio. But it's not a critical part of the portfolio, in terms of even thinking about the revenue for us. I wouldn't do that as a big part of the revenue we make in the oncology business at all. The reason we did it, because we want to make sure that our customers can have the broadest options in terms of what they want to do, but it's not a meaningful contributor to our revenue in oncology Yeah. So I'll start with the easy part, but we are not seeing any slowdown right now, because of Delta, we're not seeing any shutdowns. The whole \u2013 was fast you know Patrick, I mean, you could see that in terms of DSO like you saw the improved linearity in this quarter, the way it felt internally is we started the quarter fast and it got faster. So it didn't, there was no slowdown in the middle. But what was surprising again, was it started really fast. So the hockey stick at the end I'd say was not necessarily as pronounced because we had a fast starting in the quarter. Yeah. I mean, that has been quite a remarkable story. I think I mentioned a few minutes ago that if you look at the number of instruments we're shipping in that segment it's now almost double what we shipped historically into that segment. So a few things I'll point out; one, we continue to ship 550 and 550Dx. So there are people who validated workflows on those instruments, they're continuing to buy. We are seeing a good number of new to Illumina and new to that segment customers come in. It continues to be on the clinical workhorses of our portfolio. And you see applications in oncology, you see applications in NIPT and that continues to be true. The things we talked about in terms of the expansion we're seeing in the clinical markets, all that reimbursement that kicked in last year for oncology, for NIPT, all of that is driving the instrument purchases we're seeing. And that's a really great sign because as we talked about instrument purchases for us are a lead indicator of future growth and so when you place that many instruments, it's exciting for us to think about and so those are some things that are driving. Yeah. So let me \u2013 let me start and I'll turn it over to Sam. In terms of the CDC money and the American Rescue Plan Act and all that money where, we are watching to see how that money gets allocated out. We haven't really built much of that into our expectations the course of this year, because there's still work to be done in terms of how that money gets allocated out. We certainly expect some benefit from it going into the following years, but we haven't built that much in some colored more. Spatial and proteomics are definitely interesting, they are definitely emerging. They are maybe where single cell was a few years ago, single cell certainly a much bigger contributor of our business today than spatial or proteomics, but given the amount of interest in both, we do expect those to be growth drivers for our business going forward. Thank you for the questions. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the investor section of our website. As well the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update call into close of third fiscal quarter of 2021."

            "content": "As Francis outlined, second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations, growing 78% year-over-year to $1.126 billion, driven by 80% growth in sequencing and 57% growth in microarrays. For the first time in company history, total quarter sequencing revenue exceeded $1 billion, growing 4% sequentially to $1.021 billion and representing 91% of total revenue. Our core business continued to accelerate across all regions in the quarter driven by growth in clinical, as well as strong demand from our research customers who were particularly impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 and are continuing to resume and expand their sequencing. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 82% year-over-year to $704 million, led by record NovaSeq consumables shipments, with robust demand driven by V1.5 flow cells. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $189 million, reflecting another quarter of significant strength across all instrument categories. NovaSeq shipments more than doubled from the second quarter of 2020, driven by continued adoption by new to high-throughput customers. Mid-throughput system shipments reached a new high, driven by record NextSeqDx shipments and demand for NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Since launch, 25% of NextSeq 1000 and 2000 have been shipped to new-to-Illumina customers. Revenue contributions from COVID-19 surveillance testing exceeded our expectations, contributing approximately $40 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $20 million in incremental instrument revenue. Sequencing service and other revenue was also higher than expected, growing 41% year-over-year to $128 million, primarily due to approximately $20 million of one-time revenue recognized from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement. Moving to regional results, revenue for the Americas region was $589 million, growing 76% compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by record sequencing product revenue related to demand for clinical oncology testing and genetic disease testing. The regional performance was also driven by strength in genetic disease research from population genomic initiatives, as well as contributions from COVID surveillance testing. EMEA delivered revenue of $320 million, representing 90% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by both a recovery in research and an acceleration of the clinical business, including a record quarter for genetic disease testing, due to momentum from expanded market access and reimbursement. COVID surveillance testing also contributed to the strong performance in the region. Greater China revenue was $132 million, representing growth of 67% year-over-year due to continued strength in sequencing led by clinical growth in the region. Sequencing instrument shipments more than doubled year-over year driven by growing demand for NextSeqDx in hospitals, given the superior ease of use, accuracy, and quality of outputs from Illumina sequencers. Finally, APJ revenue of $85 million grew 67% year-over-year, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth across clinical applications in Reproductive Health and Genetic Disease Testing, as well as strong utilization by research customers. As expected, APJ revenue decreased sequentially due to timing of fiscal year-end purchases and normal seasonality in Japan in the first quarter of 2021. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.8% improved sequentially by 130 basis points, mainly due to favorable utilization on strong demand as well as one-time revenue from a patent litigation settlement. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 320 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes, as well as a positive impact from the patent litigation settlement, partially offset by product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $471 million increased $51 million sequentially due to higher compensation related expenses and increased project related spend but were lower than expected due to the timing of certain investments shifting to the second half of 2021. As expected, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $137 million year-over-year, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses and headcount growth, as well as additional investments to support the growth of our business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.0%, compared to 32.1% in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenues and favorable gross margin, driven by higher volumes and the one-time patent litigation settlement. Non-GAAP other expense of $2 million was flat sequentially and $15 million lower year-over-year, as expected. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower interest income on short-term investments as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate of 17.9% decreased from last quarter due to a tax expense recognized in the first quarter of 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The decrease in the non-GAAP tax rate year-over-year was due to a higher mix of earnings in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate. For the second quarter, GAAP net income was $185 million or $1.26 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $276 million, or $1.87 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items, cash flow from operations was $253 million, which included $105 million in continuation payments made to Grail pursuant to the merger agreement. DSO of 44 days compared to 43 days last quarter driven by revenue linearity. Second quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $44 million and free cash flow was $209 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we used $491 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2021 convertible notes, which matured in June. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance, we now expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 32% to 34% or $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion. At the mid-point, this represents an increase of approximately $1.07 billion compared to 2020. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect, total sequencing revenue to grow approximately 35% year-over-year driven by accelerating strength in our core business and higher than expected contributions from COVID surveillance testing. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27.5% reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to continued innovation in R&D. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase approximately 200 to 250 basis points from the prior year, which is higher than our previous expectations. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.50, and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.69 to $4.89. Moving to the third quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to increase approximately 30% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35, and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. Vijay, maybe I could add just some more specificity on the one-time factors in the first half. And thank you for the question by the way. Our business is really strong and really accelerating across the core markets. They're all one-time factors in the first half that I do want to call out that are important when you think about the second half. So the one-time factors I would bucket as follows. You have in Q1, we had about $20 million of stocking. We did not see any stocking in the second quarter, but we did have $20 million in the first quarter. I would characterize roughly $55 million of COVID surveillance instruments placements, so that's $55 million in the first half. Now we're not expecting to repeat in the second half, so that's another item. There's the UK Biobank, which terminates and basically wrapped up in the third quarter. So that's about $30 million of extra revenues use in the first half that we will not have in the second half. And then finally, there's a $20 million NIPT settlement in the second quarter that I referred to in my prepared remarks that will not repeat in the second half. So if you put all these together, it's about $125 million of what I would call one-time factors in the first half that don't repeat. If you exclude those from the first half and annualize, it's basically we're looking at flattish second half versus first half. Sure. Derik. Yeah, happy to. With regards to NovaSeq, the last guidance that we shared was 1.1 million to 1.2 million for instruments that we said we were going to be on the high end of that range. So I can tell you that for Q2, we exceeded that. And now our expectation for the full year is that we will be above that range, the 1.1 million to 1.2 million, we're going to exceed that. So we're not giving an exact number, but we are going to be above that 1.2 million top-end. With regards to NextSeq, the pull through on NextSeq 550 at least, we haven't shared any pull through on NextSeq 2000 or 1000 too early right now in the life cycle of those instruments to provide that. But for NextSeq 550, whereas we're at the high end of that 100 to 150 range that we've positionally shared, so pull-through is at the high end of that. With regards to MiSeq, we are within the 40,000 to 45,000 pull-through range of that instrument. And with regards to MiniSeq we are within that \u2013 on the high-end of that 20,000 to 25,000 pull-through range for that instrument. You're welcome. Yeah. When you think about, Patrick with regards to just one more point on your question, no we did not see that slowdown as Francis said, we are still in a COVID year and Delta is obviously still raising. So we still \u2013 when you think about the second half, we still obviously think about the potential impact of any shutdowns, et cetera. But at this point we're not seeing that and the quarter exited very strong as it started. Maybe I can add a data points with regards to adoption and the split by customer type or not maybe customer type, but just in terms of where we're seeing the placements come from. We are seeing roughly 25% coming from new to Illumina customers into the NextSeq 2000 and 1000, which is really encouraging, basically expanding the pie in terms of new sales in our customers. We're also seeing roughly 30% coming from bank stuffed customers. So those customers that are either on MiSeq or MiniSeq that are now going up to the NextSeq 2000 and 1000, and we're seeing also capacity upgrades, as well as NextSeq 550 conversions going into NextSeq 2000 and 1000. But as we said as well, the NextSeq 550 and NextSeq 550Dx is really holding very strong with continued placements in those categories. What we are not seeing is HiSeq customers going really to NextSeq 2000 instead of NovaSeq. So that's something we always said we didn't expect, and we are not seeing if we're seeing only a really very, very small handful of customers having done that. So maybe first on the American Rescue Plan and some of the funding that went in there, the 1.7 billion with 400 million going into these centers of excellence out of which 90 million has now been allocated, but it will be a really decided in August of 2022, how that gets allocated. I think that's a more of a long-term benefit that we expect for the business. So that's the \u2013 what we expect will be the durable genomic epidemiology benefit, the infrastructure that gets built that we see as definitely a potential upside in future years, not this year. In terms of this year, Kyle, just to kind of script out what is the progression in terms of the guide. In Q1, we have 55 million with 35 million instruments, 20 million consumables. In Q2 we had 60 million with 20 million instruments and 40 million consumables and our expectation in the second half is that we have approximately 50 million to 60 million of sequencing consumables revenue in the second half. We look at it as equally split between Q3 and Q4. That is higher than what we had guided through on the Q1, call just driven off of the additional utilization and placements that we're seeing in the first half."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared in our pre announcement, Illumina had a very strong start to 2021, with the first $1 billion quarter in Illumina's history. We achieved first quarter revenue of $1.093 billion, growing 27% compared to the prior year and 15% from the last quarter. Sequencing revenue was especially strong, up 29% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by accelerating growth in our core business, with both clinical and research customers exceeding pre-COVID activity levels. In addition, we're seeing global investment in the creation of a genomic epidemiology infrastructure to combat COVID-19, as well as monitor for future pathogen outbreaks. I'd like to share some additional first quarter highlights by platform. Beginning with our high throughput platforms, NovaSeq drove a significant share of the exceptional performance, achieving its highest first quarter placements on record, which is remarkable as it enters its fifth year since launch. We continue to see the positive impact of our version 1.5 reagents, enabling both new high throughput customers as well as continued conversions from our existing HiSeq customer base. Our mid-throughput platforms drove additional growth, with a 23% increase in consumables revenue compared to last year. We saw continued success for NextSeq 1000 and 2000, as well as strong performance from NextSeq 550. Notably, we saw an increase in customers upgrading from their existing Illumina benchtop sequencers to NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Clinical customers continue to drive new NextSeq 550 placements, with NextSeq Dx recording its highest shipment quarter to date. In China, where the instrument received NMPA approval in Q4, we're seeing strong adoption in the hospital setting as we work with IVD development partners like Burning Rock, Biosan and MatriDx, to provide comprehensive clinical solutions. Additionally, working with our strategic partner, R-Pharm, NextSeq Dx received medical device registration in Russia in March, enabling the clinical use of next-generation sequencing for more patients across Russia. Our low throughput portfolio revenue had another strong quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, with robust growth in both sequencing consumables and instrument shipments in Q1. MiSeq, MiniSeq and HiSeq all generated year-over-year and sequential growth in consumables as well as instrument placements. Our low-throughput platforms continue to be a compelling entry point for new-to-NGS customers with an ever-increasing number of use cases. One interesting customer example is Blue & Blue [ph], a startup using our technology in the development of cell cultured seafood to support sustainability and oceanic diversity. Additionally, these instruments play a critical role in catalyzing localized COVID surveillance programs across the globe. Turning to our Clinical and Research and Applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was up 26% year-over-year, demonstrating strong demand for sequencing across both Clinical and Research segments, more than 44% of our sequencing consumable shipments in the first quarter of 2021 were to clinical customers. Clinical testing showed significant growth with consumables up 35% year-over-year. These results do not include COVID surveillance, which is reported in our Research and Academic segment. Oncology testing exceeded our overall clinical growth rate and is our largest and fastest growing clinical segment. This growth was driven by our customers benefiting from expanded access to reimbursement for NGS-based testing, particularly in comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, for therapy selection and some of the first reimbursement for sequencing-based monitoring tests. TruSight Oncology 500, our RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, continued its success this quarter, adding over 20 new customers. In February, the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology announced that they will use TSO 500 for a national pilot to evaluate the use of CGP for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. As a leading distributable CGP assay, TSO 500 continues to offer a compelling choice for our pharmaceutical partners. We announced last week an exciting new partnership with Kartos Therapeutics, to develop a TP 53 companion diagnostic, expanding the TruSight Oncology offering into blood cancers. Beyond CGP, we've seen promising developments in the use of whole genome sequencing in cancer treatment this quarter. Most notably, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine published by our partners at Washington University, St. Louis, showed that for AML and MDS patients studied, whole genome sequencing using Illumina technology produced more accurate results in less time and at a similar cost compared to standard techniques like fish or karyotyping. In reproductive health, the cascading effect of the ACON guidance on increasing coverage of NIPT for all pregnancies drove the third consecutive quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth. In the U.S., two large payers, Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, expanded their coverage criteria to include twin pregnancies just last month. And in March, we reported out on the results of our groundbreaking, risk-sharing, real-world study with Harvard Pilgrim, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of offering NIPT to all pregnant women. These studies add to the building momentum for broader access to NIPT. International support for NIPT coverage also continues to grow, fueling the continued rapid adoption of our CE-IVD marked NIPT kit. For example, there was positive news from Italy and Sweden, where new coverage requirements were approved during the first quarter of 2021. Moving to genetic disease testing. Customers are choosing Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers, and our growth rate in this segment exceeded the company's growth rate in Q1. We also continue to see new favorable coverage decisions being issued. This quarter, two major health insurers in Germany announced that they will cover the cost of whole genome and whole exome sequencing for rare disease for their over 10 million members. And Geisinger in the U S expanded coverage to include epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Research continues to demonstrate a 40% to 68% diagnostic year for children suspected of having a genetic disease, and whole-genome sequencing is used as a first-tier test. The increasing coverage of these tests will provide more patients with faster diagnoses and better care. Turning to our research and academic segment. We saw strong growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period, as the majority of research and academic customers have returned to the lab. The pandemic and emerging variants of concern have raised awareness within governments around the world about the essential role that genomic pathogen surveillance plays in the fight against infectious disease. We're seeing investment globally in the creation of a pathogen surveillance infrastructure to manage outbreaks and improve health outcomes, including sequencing capabilities to determine the spread of pathogens, the emergence of variant strains and emerging drug or vaccine resistance. In the US, the American Rescue Plan Act includes $1.7 billion in funding for the CDC to improve sequencing capacity to identify mutation and circulation of viruses. In Europe, the EC announced \u20ac123 million commitment to combat COVID variants. In India, the government launched the Indian SARS-CoV-2, Genomic Consortia, with a plan to sequence 120, 000 viral genomes over the next four months. This investment in sequencing for national genomic surveillance activities drove approximately $55 million of incremental revenue in the first quarter, comprising of $35 million in instrument placements and $20 million in sequencing consumables. As countries around the world battle the pandemic, we expect continued investment in genomic pathogen surveillance to expand national genomic epidemiology capabilities. While the initial focus of this infrastructure is COVID surveillance, there are durable longer-term needs, including tracking future emerging natural pathogens, bio terrorism, antimicrobial drug resistance and hospital-acquired infections, and determining how host genetics can impact the risk and severity of infectious disease. While the pandemic has certainly fueled demand for our sequencing, we also believe it has established a new baseline of awareness and infrastructure build out that will support sustained activity. As we work through the COVID-19 pandemic, we're also seeing acceleration in several population genomics programs, expanding our presence in national health systems around the world. In the US, all of us ramped up sample volumes in Q1 to a level that we expect to continue throughout 2021. In Japan, the Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization chose Illumina sequencing for a 40,000-sample multigenerational study to take place this year. In February, Egypt announced the first population genomics program in Africa, with the launch of their Egyptian genome project. This project is focused on establishing a map of the Egyptian human genome, with the goal of ushering the country into the world of precision medicine. Large population health initiatives serve as one good example of our focus on improving the health of patients, communities and our planet. Earlier this month, we published our second annual CSR report, outlining our specific commitments to help improve our world. This 2021 report is available on our website, and notable highlights include: expanded transparency on U.S. diversity demographics, climate resilience planning, disclosure on trade group membership and data assurance on energy and emissions. We look forward to continued investor feedback on the evolution of our environmental, social and governance programs. Our commitment to the advancement of human health is an Illumina core tenet, which brings me to GRAIL. We are pleased with the progress GRAIL is making and remain committed to pursue the completion of the GRAIL acquisition. GRAIL recently presented affirmative data from its CCGA 3 study at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, and is expecting to launch Gallery, its breakthrough multi-cancer early detection screening test in Q2. One of the many reasons we decided to acquire GRAIL was to accelerate patient access to breakthrough multi-cancer early detection blood tests, which could save tens of thousands of lives. We are committed to supporting all our customers and strongly believe that our acquisition of GRAIL is pro competitive. We expect the acquisition to accelerate the early detection of cancer market as a whole. We saw a similar dynamic play out in the noninvasive prenatal testing market, where, after Illumina's entry, the market grew and prices decreased, making these important tests accessible to a much larger population of pregnant women. And now I'll turn it over to Sam.\nSam Samad: As Francis outlined, first quarter revenue grew by 27% year-over-year to $1.093 billion, driven by 29% growth in sequencing and 15% growth in microarrays. Record revenue across all regions contributed to the first $1 billion quarter in the company's history. Total sequencing revenue reached a new high, with first quarter revenue of $979 million, growing 16% sequentially and representing 90% of total revenue. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 26% compared to the prior year period, driven by strong growth in clinical testing and demand for NovaSeq version 1.5 flow cells. Most clinical and research customers are running above pre-COVID activity levels, as Francis highlighted. COVID-19 surveillance initiatives contributed approximately $20 million in sequencing consumables revenue during the first quarter. Sequencing consumables also benefited by approximately $20 million from the timing of customer purchases during the first quarter. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 123% year-over-year, with revenue of $176 million in the first quarter, reflecting strong performance across all instrument categories. The first quarter marked another consecutive quarter of record mid throughput shipments, driven by strong adoption of NextSeq 1000 and 2000. COVID surveillance initiatives resulted in approximately $35 million of incremental instrument revenue due to some customers building additional capacity for genomic epidemiology. As expected, sequencing service and other revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to IVD partnership revenue recognized in the prior year period. Sequencing service and other words, roughly flat sequentially. Moving to regional results, the Americas delivered revenue of $562 million with 18% growth, compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strength in sequencing product revenue from clinical customers in oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing, and contributions from genomic epidemiology initiatives related to COVID surveillance. These items were partially offset by lower IVD partnership revenue as expected. EMEA delivered revenue of $305 million, representing 38% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by strong sequencing demand for clinical testing applications that resulted in higher-than-expected sequencing consumables revenue in the first quarter and instrument demand by research customers, including initiatives for COVID surveillance and genomic epidemiology. Greater China revenue was $127 million, representing growth of 51% year-over-year and 32% sequentially due to continued strength in sequencing revenue, driven by clinical expansion in the region and growing demand in hospitals, including the successful launch of NextSeq 550Dx. Finally, APJ revenue of $99 million grew 29%, both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth in clinical applications, such as oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing, as well as end of fiscal year purchases. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% improved sequentially by 360 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes and a one-time inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin decreased 250 basis points due to IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, higher freight costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and product mix, partially offset by fixed cost leverage on higher volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $420 million were up $81 million year-over-year, in line with expectations, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses, headcount growth and increased project spend during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly down sequentially, driven by an additional week in Q4 2020, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.1%, up from 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential improvement was better than expected due to higher revenues, gross margin and resulting increased fixed cost absorption in the quarter. Non-GAAP other expense of $3 million was $23 million lower sequentially as expected. This was due to fourth quarter gains on short-term investments that we sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. In addition, we had lower interest income in the first quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% was up from last quarter due to tax expense on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, partly due to the capital requirements associated with funding the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income was $147 million or $1 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $278 million or $1.89 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million, DSO of 43 days compared to 50 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $42 million, and free cash flow was $240 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. We ended the year with approximately $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we received approximately $1 billion in proceeds from bond issuances to fund the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 25% to 28% or $4.05 billion to $4.15 billion. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an increase of approximately $858 million and a significant increase from our expectations earlier this year. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 29% year-over-year, driven by strong orders and instrument placements. This includes sequencing consumable growth of approximately 30% compared to 2020, driven by NovaSeq version 1.5 Reagent and growth in clinical markets. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow approximately 50% year-over-year, driven by NovaSeq placements to new to high throughput customers and continued HiSeq conversion, in addition to mid throughput demand across our NextSeq platforms. NovaSeq pull-through to be towards the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million. Our view is to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to improve from 2020 levels, reflecting increased leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 26.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to investment in research and development. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect non-GAAP other income to be about $60 million lower than 2020, due to the gains realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest income on shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition and interest expense from our recent bond issuances. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.05 and GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.97. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 148 million. Moving to the second quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to be up approximately 60% year-over-year due to the broader economic recovery and strength in our core business. We expect a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin due to the higher volumes and resulting leverage. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be down modestly on a sequential basis, due to mix and additional investments to support the higher-than-expected volume growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses did increase significantly on a year-over-year and sequential basis, due to investments supporting the growth of the business and research and development, as well as compensation-related expenses. Non-GAAP other expense to be modestly unfavorable on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. Non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 for the quarter and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Sam. Illumina is off to a very strong start to 2021, and it's clear that momentum is building across our customers globally. We witnessed the diversity and strength of our growing community in our first annual customer conference over the last couple of days. About 8,500 people registered to hear from the world's leading genomic and healthcare pioneers, including Jennifer Doudna, Francis Collins, Bill Gates, Frances Arnold and James Suhail. The topics included the critical role of genomics in fighting the pandemic, making genomics a foundational element of a national standard of care, integrating multiomic readouts and harnessing the power of AI and machine learning in oncology, among others. From battling cancer to genetic disease diagnosis, defining the pandemic, the transformative impact genomics will have on human health is accelerating, and we, at Illumina, are proud of the key role that our customers, partners and employees are playing in making it happen. Now I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please ask only one question so that we can accommodate as many analysts as possible. And your first question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Francis. Thanks for the questions. The first one is really, what are you baking in for COVID surveillance here in the 25% to 28% guide for the year? I mean, I think the question really is, the COVID surveillance opportunity and the cadence of that as you build out the epidemiological infrastructure, how is -- what's the cadence of that? And appreciate that COVID is still raging in different parts of the world, U.S. vaccinations are ramping, and administration is investing $1 billion-plus in sequencing. So just wondering how much of that is baked in into this year? And how -- what sort of a tail should we see longer term there? And then, my second one is just on GRAIL. What does the process look like next for both FTC and the European Commission Directorate General? What are the steps? And obviously, you're implying a second half close here. So just wondering what's the -- what are some of the next steps? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Well, thanks for your questions, Puneet. I'll start by saying that, it is -- it's exciting to see how the world is sort of moving forward with putting out a surveillance infrastructure for pathogens. It's something, as you know, Puneet, we've been talking about from the beginning of last year and talking about the fact that in addition to testing, what we really need is this genomic epidemiology infrastructure. So it's encouraging to see that play out around the world and to see the big commitments here made in the U.S. Now to get to your question, in terms of what we're building into this year, the vast majority of the growth in that 25% to 28% is coming from our core business. So the way we've modeled this year is we said, look, we expect small contributions from the surveillance infrastructure over the course of the whole year. We saw some investment in Q1. And so we saw a bolus of $35 million in instrument purchases that we got in Q1 to lay out some of that infrastructure, and we saw some consumables infrastructure. So in terms of our model, we continue to model some consumable purchases over the course of the rest of the year, but not a lot in terms of additional infrastructure investment. Now the way we expect it to play out is we are seeing the bid commitment made even in the U.S. around the American Rescue Plan, and we expect some of that investment to be released towards the tail end of this year and start to play out more next year. And what's interesting is that this infrastructure, while it'll be very helpful in fighting the pandemic is really a durable plan by the nations that are rolling it out. And what they are thinking about is a long-term creation of a genomics-based pathogen surveillance infrastructure to help fight this pandemic and prepare as next -- for the next outbreak, whether it's a natural outbreak or bio terrorism or emerging antimicrobial resistance or hospital acquired infections. And so we do expect, as you point out, some tail on this. It's not a story of this year. In fact, we've modeled in very little this year, but it really is a story that plays out into next year and going forward. And so that's how thinking about it in terms of model. Obviously, as more details come out, we'll make sure to share them with you. In terms of GRAIL, as I said, we are committed to pursuing the acquisition of GRAIL. In the U.S. that means we are taking our case into district court. And we're also working with the European Commission on their review of the GRAIL acquisition. We continue to feel that the facts are on our side, the law is on our side. And we continue to expect that the deal will close and will close in the second half of this year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. I want to ask about antitrust and strategy and then also guidance philosophy. So on antitrust and strategy, as you know, over the last couple of years, Illumina has run into challenges with regulators on the now abandoned acquisition of PacBio and the plan to acquire GRAIL. And recognizing everything you said in your prepared remarks as well as in your response to Puneet's question on GRAIL, I am wondering, one, how is your criteria for strategic opportunities evolving in light of these developments? And two, what changes you're making in process? You obviously felt adequate in terms of how you're approaching these deals, but both proved to be a lot more challenging than you expected. So presumably, you are making changes accordingly. I think it would be helpful to hear about those. And then on guidance philosophy, how would you describe confidence in your targets for this year at this point? I mean, your targets make a lot of sense to me, even though the growth numbers are really big. And you did talk about -- I think it was $1.4 billion in backlog enter in Q2. Yes, that said, the world is still uncertain, as we all know, coming out of 2020. And then if we go back to 2019, it was a tough year for Illumina relative to self-imposed targets. So with those things in mind, I'm just -- I think it would be helpful to hear about the philosophy you're applying to guidance this year. And if you still think you're skewing towards the more conservative side of things? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Hey, Doug, so let me take both parts of your question. I'll talk first about our acquisition strategy, specifically touching on any impact from our experience with the FTC and how it changes power philosophy going forward. And then I'll talk about guidance for the rest of the year. And Sam may contribute then, too. So first, by saying, if you look at our acquisitions over the last couple of years, we have -- we attempted the PacBio acquisition, I think, so that three years ago, initiated that, and we obviously didn't get that through the FTC. But we were successful in closing the Edico acquisition, which was a huge success in terms of building in the DRAGEN technology into our sequencers and has been super well received by our customers, and so really create a positive momentum on the informatics side. We also completed, for example, the Enancio acquisition and brought lossless data compression technologies and capabilities into our -- into our sequencers as well. And so what we're seeing is we've had success in terms of buying innovative technologies that we can build into our sequencers and take to market. But we're also seeing that given how popular our sequencers are in our core market that we have work to do in terms of some of these bigger acquisitions. And so one, I think we're going to continue to scan the marketplace and look for acquisitions that make sensible technology tuck-ins, as well as from, time to time, larger acquisitions that make sense. We continue to believe that vertical acquisitions are well within bounds, and that's where we're going to go to court on the GRAIL acquisition. And we also recognize that given the scale we are and given our position in the market, we will have to do more work in terms of educating the regulators about our business and making sure they are up to speed on our business even before we do an acquisition. So that's another takeaway over the last couple of years. Strategically, though, I'd say, we're still continuing to focus on making sure that we are looking for places where we can allocate capital, both internally and externally, that deliver maximum shareholder value. And that focus hasn't changed at all. In terms of our guiding philosophy for the year, I think you touched on a couple of important points. It's a balanced point of view, we feel, that on the one hand, recognizes that we're coming into the year and we're coming off the quarter with a huge amount of momentum in our core business. So if you look at both the clinical side of the business and the research side of the business, we're seeing real strength, and that's showing up in terms of the revenue numbers that we had in Q4, but obviously, also in Q1, it's showing up in the orders numbers, it's showing up in the instrument, the huge instrument growth rate we saw year-on-year in Q1. And so a huge amount of momentum in our core business. You add to that, we're seeing very positive signs from the COVID surveillance add-on business. And so on the one hand, with the huge amount of momentum going into the rest of the year, but as you point out, there's still uncertainty because we're still dealing with the pandemic. And so we're still watching to see how the pandemic plays out as countries are grappling with the third wave and a fourth wave, and that could have impact on people's ability to go into the labs or run their clinical sequencing that they that they need. And so we're balancing those two. And the numbers we put out, although they are big numbers, we have confidence in and we think it strikes that appropriate balance. I don't know, Sam, if you have anything else to add.\nSam Samad: Yes. I think you hit it, Francis. I mean just to be very brief and add maybe a couple of comments. One is, we have a high degree of confidence about our guidance range. It is a balanced outlook for the year. What gives us a lot of that confidence, Doug, is the strength of the core business. We are enjoying tremendous strength in the core business, and that adds to the confidence that we have. I think the only potential headwind that I would call out or risk is the uncertainty related to the pandemic, as Francis mentioned.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. A couple of quick ones here. On the instrument strength, Francis, I'm just curious, as labs are getting back up and running, how much of what you're seeing is kind of catch-up spending from last year's delays? Obviously, you're guiding above the Street for the full year. So maybe, it isn't any sort of pull forward, but I'm wondering if you can comment on that. And then on the COVID work, I think last quarter, you said you were winning over 70% of those projects. Can you maybe just talk to the competitive dynamics there? And then as we think about your instrument fleet, which of the platforms you think are going to be most suitable for kind of the ongoing surveillance applications? And then, one question on competition. There's kind of a third wave of sequencing companies common single element on them. I'm just curious, as you look out the next couple of years, how you think about the competitive landscape evolving? And then last one for Sam, FX contribution. I didn't hear that, and curious if you could break that out in the quarter. Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Thanks, Tycho. All right. Had a bunch of questions in there, so let me make sure I capture them all. I will -- so first, you asked us about the strength we're seeing from the instrument portfolio, let's comment on what's driving that. Then you asked about COVID surveillance and said, look, we talked about, we will represent about 70% of the surveillance testing that was done and how is that playing out since we last talked about the numbers, which instruments play best for that. And then, sort of, a commentary on the competitive landscape. Okay. So let me start with instrument strength. Yes. We talked about the fact that we had enormous instrument strength in Q1, so more than doubling year-over-year in terms of the revenue in Q1 that we got from sequencing instruments, a huge amount of strength. And what's driving that is the strength in the core businesses, both the clinical side and the research side. We talked about the strength that we saw on the clinical side in oncology testing. That oncology testing, as a segment, is now not only our largest clinical segment, but it's actually our fastest-growing segment. And there's lots of drivers behind the strength in the oncology segment, right? And more broadly in the clinical segment. One of the big drivers is, we saw a very significant step forward in reimbursement across a number of clinical segments last year. Genetic disease testing, oncology, NIPT. And so what's happening is that the addressable market, in terms of people who have access to the tests in a reimbursed way, has expanded last year. And so that's driving increased business for our customers in the clinic, and that's driving their purchases. Other dynamics that are playing out are the strength of the clinical business in China, for example, and the clearance we received from the NMPA around NextSeq, and that's driving an instrument growth. And so, it's not catch up. It's just -- the market continues to build, right? So with more reimbursement, the addressable market expands. With more cleared products, the addressable market expands in terms of our ability to place instruments into hospitals, for example, in China. And that's really what's driving the instrument strength. And obviously, that's hugely exciting, because that talks well about future consumable spend from all the instruments that we placed in Q1. In terms of COVID, and what we talked about is if you look at GISAID or NCBI, you can track in terms of the number of genomes that are deposited, the platforms they have been run on. And so I think there was a helpful blog that came out in the last couple of days. I think Keith Robinson did a genomics clinic blog. And he did an analysis, and it's pretty close to what we did, too, which says that our share there is about -- it's gone up about 79%. Now of all the genomes in GISAID have been done on Illumina platforms. I think the next highest is O&T with about 17%, I believe, and that tapers off after that. And so similar, but maybe a little bit better than what we talked about last time. In terms of the instruments, there's a broad range of instruments that are being used for surveillance. Obviously, NovaSeqs are a very popular instrument in the high-volume shops. But we're seeing a lot of NextSeqs and MiSeqs being used as well. And so it's the blend, if you like, that are playing really well. In terms of competition, but there's always competition in the market. As you can imagine, a market that's this early and growing this quickly is going to continue to attract investment dollars. So like you were looking at some emerging players that are going to be investing in the next year or two, and I think you listed some of them, there are clearly players that are in the market right now, too, that we compete with. But that's been true every year. So I'd say every year, we face a new wave of venture-funded competitors. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and deliver more value to our customers.\nSam Samad: Yes. With regards to FX, Tycho. So for Q1, I would say, compared to Q1 of 2020, FX benefit contributed approximately 3% in terms of benefit year-over-year, and that was driven mostly by the euro and the RMB, so appreciation of those currencies. If we look at the full year, we're expecting that benefit to moderate as we look forward, so definitely, more of the benefit in the first half versus the second half. And we're expecting, for the full year, approximately, I would say, 2% in terms of overall benefit from currencies versus 2020.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: You're welcome.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with BTIG.\nSung Ji Nam: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Francis, could you talk about oncology testing? Obviously, a lot of strength there, and you attributed that to better reimbursement and other favorable trends. Just curious about, given the visibility you guys have across all the diagnostic companies out there, what -- if you're seeing any, kind of catch-up from all the delays to screening and cancer diagnosis last year, would love to kind, of hear your thoughts there and your visibility into that.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So as you point out, obviously, we work very closely with our customers, and we have terrific customers like FMI and Gardens and so on in oncology testing. And our perspective is that they -- if you were in the liquid biopsy space, so if you offer a blood-based test, you are actually more durable through the pandemic than many other types of clinical testing. And so some of our customers found very innovative ways in terms of mobile phlebotomy units or having home-based access to the test even for some patients. And that's possible if you have a blood test. And so in oncology testing, I think one of the stories of the pandemic is going to be that there was an acceleration of the acceptance of liquid biopsy, and I think that's a durable trend. I think we come out of the pandemic, and you'll continue to see the growth in liquid biopsy, because people realize that not only can you get high-quality results, but it's a much more patient-friendly way to do the test than a tissue-based test. So I think if possible, you'll see liquid biopsy being a preferred way to go. Now what that means, there isn't really a whole lot of catch-up to do in Q1 because you saw the durability of liquid biopsies. And so far and away, I think the biggest driver of the strength in oncology are things like: One, expanded reimbursement for things like CGP; two, the continued emergence of new therapeutics that leverage genomic biomarkers. And that's also showing up in terms of the companion diagnostic relationships that we're signing up for TSO 500. And then the availability of products like TSO 500 from us, from our -- from our partners that create products that make it easier for labs to stand up those steps. And so I think all of those factors are driving the durable strength in oncology testing, and there may be a little catch up, but frankly, if there was, it wasn't much, in my opinion.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Max Masucci with Canaccord Genuity.\nMax Masucci: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great start to the year. So piggybacking on a prior question. The language in the FTC's challenge of the GRAIL acquisition seems to be narrowly focused on blood-based multi-cancer screening, which is just one of the several emerging clinical applications within a broader liquid biopsy landscape, which does seek to serve a wide range of cancer types. So with this in mind, while the GRAIL acquisition is under FTC review, is it reasonable to expect that you'll continue to be active on the M&A front? And if the deal is blocked, is it reasonable to expect that any future M&A activity would target companies that are developing of clinical liquid biopsy applications targeted for just one or a small number of cancer types versus sort of the home run opportunity in multi cancer?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. I think that's a good observation in terms of the fact that liquid biopsy or blood-based tests are used for various types of testing in oncology. So one type, as you point out, is multi-cancer early detection, which is what GRAIL does as well as other players that are looking to do that in the market. Another area that liquid biopsy is used is for therapy selection. So helping match patients -- cancer patients who were already diagnosed with the right therapies for them. We already have a product, a kit that serves that space. So our TSO 500 product is used for therapy selection. A completely different part of the market requires a different technology, looks for different things in the blood. And so liquid biopsy can be used for many things, but they're very different segments. And all of them are different and require sort of different technologies as part of a liquid biopsy approach. The answer is, we are going to continue to look at M&A going forward. It's going to be both technology tuck-ins that help us advance our mission and our strategic priorities and that could be a range of things. It could be technology tuck-ins. It look -- it could look for capabilities that extend the offerings as part of our sequencing offerings. And so we're going to continue to do that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening and thanks for the time. Francis, a three-parter for you: one on COVID, one on arrays and one on sequencing services. So on COVID, you mentioned the surveillance efforts in India, both earlier during the pandemic in your prepared remarks this afternoon. I think you said about 125,000 viral genomes in the next few months here. And obviously, you have the funding coming through in the U.S. and Europe as well. Why is that, that you're not expecting this kind of work to contribute a little more in the near term of that $20 million consumables contribution in the first quarter? So that's my first question. Second, on sequencing services, and this is more for Sam. Outside of the $25 million milestone in the year-over-year comp, quarterly growth was essentially flattish. Are there any offsets that we should be thinking about in terms of this quarter? And then finally, on arrays, the business, I mean, both from a services and consumables standpoint, actually grew year-over-year after quite a while. Is it fair to think of the business finally having bottomed here outside of the usual seasonality that you'll see in 2Q and beyond?\nFrancis deSouza: Okay. So you got a few parts there. So I'll start, and we'll talk a little bit about COVID. And the question is, why not more, right? Because it's clearly there's now a very recognized value in terms of using sequencing for genomic pathogen-based surveillance, both for COVID and as a recognition that this infrastructure is going to be valuable for many, many, many years to come. So the question is, why not more? The second question you had is with arrays, have we bottomed out? Okay. So let's go to the first one. We absolutely sort of believe that we are laying an infrastructure here that's durable, that it's going to be an important part of all national -- major national health systems going forward. We absolutely believe that this infrastructure is going to be valuable, not just to protect the public health, but also from a national defense perspective. So we expect this is going to play out over a decade plus, right? And we are going to have, in most countries, some kind of genomic pathogen-based surveillance going forward. In terms of how we thought about it this year, so the way we thought about it this year, is we said, you see some bolus of instrument buying in Q1 and we expect -- that was the bulk of the instrument buying we should expect to see this year. And we've talked about the fact that many countries now, we engaged with them last year, they bought some sequencing. And so, for the rest of this year, we expect to continue to see consumable buying. But our expectation is what you saw, the bulk of the instrument buying for what's going to happen this year already happened. It is possible that more happens, and the things that would drive that are, obviously, the American Rescue Plan that talks about some very big numbers. Our expectations are that it's going to take a while for the details to be worked out. And so, while you'll see consumables being purchased over the course of the year, it won't really be towards the end of the year, we expect, that you'll start to see people talking about, okay, where are these 6 Centers of Excellence, how much sequencing infrastructure do they already have, how much additional hardware we need. And so it's going to be a story of the tail end of this year going into next year and beyond from an instruments perspective. And so that's how we thought about it. We'll keep you up-to-date if any of that accelerates over the course of this year. In terms of arrays, we did see some growth year-over-year. And there are different parts to that business. There's the direct-to-consumer part, and then there's sort of -- and maybe Sam will talk a little bit about how those parts play out.\nSam Samad: Yes. So I think the way you characterize the stay house [ph] is correct in the sense that the business is stabilizing, and we're seeing less of a negative -- definitely not a negative impact from arrays. We actually saw them grow in Q1. The fact of the matter is, DTC is now a very small part of our business. It's somewhere between 2% and 3% of our overall revenues. Back in 2018, DTC was a much bigger contributor to our overall revenue. So even though we're very pleased to see arrays growing in Q1, it's -- DTC specifically is less of a contributor, and we still see the mature arrays that we have, the mature business, whether it's agrigenomics or other applications continuing to grow as well and has continued to grow over time. Maybe to go to the last question that you had with regards to sequencing services and others, so let me explain the dynamics there, Tejas. Q1 over Q1 of last year, we do have a negative headwind related to a $25 million IVD licensing fee that we had in Q1 of 2020 that we didn't see in Q1 of this year. So that was a negative. And as you saw, sequencing and other were down for the quarter by 16%. As we look for the year, what our guidance assumes is no material licensing fees or IVD fees with regards to any significant transactions or partnerships, I should say, for the year. So we're expecting mostly sequencing service and other to be flattish for the year, quarter-over-quarter. And that's consistent with our original guidance that we had back in January.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good afternoon. Hey, a few questions. So I guess the first one is just looking at your revenue guidance, just a couple of questions and also just results. First question is, how much of your HiSeq suite still needs to be upgraded? And how much of the strength you saw in the first quarter was due to basically people that were planning upgrades last year and never did them. Just trying to get a sense of, one, I think there's a lot of questions on sort of the instrument strength. And also, just looking at the guide, you're just -- it looks like roughly that the -- roughly $1 billion each in Q2, Q3, Q4 is the way, acknowledging you probably have some conservatism built in there. So I'm just wondering, as you look at that second half, it's like why would be flattish given historical trends? And then just one other question on -- can you walk us through sort of like the full stock comp numbers this year and like how those flow in and how this flow into 2022? Just so we can get a better sense of how to model? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So, Thanks, Derik. So a couple of -- I guess, three questions, one around HiSeq, the second one about our guide, and then the third about stock-based comp. So I'll start talking with HiSeq, and then I'll turn it over to Sam to talk about the other two. So in terms of the HiSeqs, we -- well, when we first started the NovaSeq upgrade path, as you know, we talked about the fact there were 850 HiSeq customers that, over time, we expect that the majority -- the vast majority of them would move to NovaSeq. So between 2017 and then until the end of last year, we went from 850 that had to upgrade, and then we refresh the numbers and shared with you that we are now left with 320 that had to upgrade. And so that upgrade continued in Q1. I don't think there was a bolus or a catch-up. I think it was more of a steady course of upgrade as we've continued to see, and we expect to continue to see that play forward over the quarters of this year and going into future years. So there was definitely continued upgrading, but there wasn't really a giant bolus or a catch-up that happened. So now I'll turn over to you, Sam.\nSam Samad: Yes. With regards to your other two questions, Derik, so first, let me talk about the linearity, which is I think what you're referring to with regards to the approximately $1 billion quarter. So first of all, let's keep in mind, for Q1, we did have a couple of, I would say, items that benefited Q1, one was with regards to the $35 million of instrument purchases with regards to COVID surveillance. We believe that was a one-timer in terms of building the infrastructure. We don't expect material instrument placements going forward with regards to COVID, at least. That's in our assumptions, in our guidance assumptions. The other one is we called it out, which was a $20 million roughly consumable purchases, what we're calling catch-up purchases in Q1. And because of the fact that the customers were maybe running a little bit lower on inventory and purchased by approximately $20 million higher than they would usually do, not a material amount, but some elements of that. So that's what elevates Q1. That's why Q2 is sequentially a step down. That's why the year and the second half is also not higher than the first half. The other contributor to the second half not being higher than the first half is the UK BioBank, which we expect to complete their sequencing in the second half. So actually, towards Q3, they will wrap up that project. So those are the contributions, and that's why I would say our linearity is flattish this year. With regards to stock-based compensation, I called out at the beginning of the year, roughly just over $50 million year-over-year impact from stock-based comp. That is now higher actually from an expense standpoint because also driven by our performance, our stock-based accruals, stock-based compensation accruals are actually higher. So we're expecting higher stock-based comp overall. So from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually north of that $50 million. We haven't called out 2022. It's still early to talk about 2022 for stock-based comp, but that impact, that negative impact, obviously moderates in 2022 versus 2021.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. And thanks, Sam. And maybe, Derik, I'll give you some more color on NovaSeq because the reality is we're seeing a huge amount of momentum in the NovaSeq business. So we talked about the fact that in Q4, we saw our highest order quarter for NovaSeq, since we first launched that product in Q1 of 2017, which is really impressive because we're entering the fifth year of NovaSeq, right? So we had huge amount of momentum in Q4, record orders, again, second only to when we launched. And then in Q1, we again had a huge amount of momentum. Just talked about the fact that it was our strongest placement order for first quarter of any year since we've launched NovaSeq. So you're absolutely right. We're seeing this huge amount of momentum. Now what's driving that? I talked about the fact that it wasn't any kind of catch-up in terms of upgrade. And what's interesting, and we called this out before, an it's continued, is that we're seeing a huge amount of strength from new to Illumina, new to high throughput customers. And that's something we didn't expect when we launched NovaSeq. About half -- were going to come from labs that were fundamentally enabled by the democratization of sequencing that we NovaSeq represents, and that continues the launch of version 1.5. And so what we're hearing from the market is 1.5 really catalyzed the elasticity of demand and was the accelerant that drove those large amount of orders of NovaSeq in Q4 and the placements that we saw in Q1.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Maybe first one for you, Sam. Just on the profitability side, pretty nice profitability improvement from the last guidance three months ago. Longer view, can you just talk about kind of the recovery towards the old normal a year or two ago, given recent headwind as COVID, inventory write-downs, price adjustment, what the path looks like to get back to that kind of old normal Illumina? And then as well, just on the mid throughput instrument side, can you just talk through the pull-through there? I guess, what's the right way to think about NextSeq, maybe this year going forward? Any color you could give on that front would be helpful.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Sure, Patrick. Thanks for the question. So with regards to profitability, I mean, as you saw in terms of both our guidance and also results in Q1, obviously, we've made pretty significant strides here in terms of improving the profitability or building on the profitability of the business. And that's -- that goes with our -- as we mentioned all along, that as the volumes start to ramp, and we saw significant strength in the business in terms of the core business and some contribution from COVID, we're seeing leverage improvement. We saw in Q1 that operating margins were north of 30%. We're expecting approximately 26.5% for the year. And we're expecting that to improve as we look forward over time. What are some of the things that are maybe the contributors to that and the ingredients to that? Obviously, gross margins, which have improved since our last guidance, and we'll continue to improve as we get past some of the COVID aspects related to higher freight expenses, for instance. Obviously, as volumes have ramped, we're seeing improvements in gross margin. We are making investments, though, I want to mention in the business, both in terms of manufacturing capacity and in terms of OpEx investments. I mean, the growth that we're seeing in the business far exceeds our expectations, and we're incredibly encouraged by that. And we have to catch up in terms of making some investments in the infrastructure to catch up with some of the demand that we're seeing, both, as I said, in terms of manufacturing and in terms of OpEx, which is why we are -- we're committed to that. But as we look forward, we're also committed to improving leverage over time and getting back to historical levels. And we're still on that path. We made good strides in just one quarter, but we're still on that path. With regards to mid throughput -- was it mid throughput or low throughput? That was the question, sorry. Mid throughput. So with regards to the throughput, we're not at the stage yet where we can share what the expectations are for pull-through in terms of NextSeq 2000, NextSeq 1000. Suffice it to say, and I know you're asking more about consumables, but I can tell you, the level that we're seeing in terms of placements on mid throughput for 2000 and 1000 as well as 550 DX and 550, is incredibly encouraging. We're seeing record placements every quarter. We're expecting to continue at that level going forward to improve on those levels going forward. And so, when you're having -- still when you're early stage of the launch of this instrument and you're seeing this growth, it's really hard now to put a level of consumable pull-through range at this stage. So we have to still give it a few quarters before we can do that.\nOperator: Now I will hand the call back over to Juliet Cunningham.\nJuliet Cunningham: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your interest and your time. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available on our website as soon as possible. And this concludes our call. We look forward to updating you for our second fiscal quarter of 2021. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared in our pre announcement, Illumina had a very strong start to 2021, with the first $1 billion quarter in Illumina's history. We achieved first quarter revenue of $1.093 billion, growing 27% compared to the prior year and 15% from the last quarter. Sequencing revenue was especially strong, up 29% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by accelerating growth in our core business, with both clinical and research customers exceeding pre-COVID activity levels. In addition, we're seeing global investment in the creation of a genomic epidemiology infrastructure to combat COVID-19, as well as monitor for future pathogen outbreaks. I'd like to share some additional first quarter highlights by platform. Beginning with our high throughput platforms, NovaSeq drove a significant share of the exceptional performance, achieving its highest first quarter placements on record, which is remarkable as it enters its fifth year since launch. We continue to see the positive impact of our version 1.5 reagents, enabling both new high throughput customers as well as continued conversions from our existing HiSeq customer base. Our mid-throughput platforms drove additional growth, with a 23% increase in consumables revenue compared to last year. We saw continued success for NextSeq 1000 and 2000, as well as strong performance from NextSeq 550. Notably, we saw an increase in customers upgrading from their existing Illumina benchtop sequencers to NextSeq 1000 and 2000. Clinical customers continue to drive new NextSeq 550 placements, with NextSeq Dx recording its highest shipment quarter to date. In China, where the instrument received NMPA approval in Q4, we're seeing strong adoption in the hospital setting as we work with IVD development partners like Burning Rock, Biosan and MatriDx, to provide comprehensive clinical solutions. Additionally, working with our strategic partner, R-Pharm, NextSeq Dx received medical device registration in Russia in March, enabling the clinical use of next-generation sequencing for more patients across Russia. Our low throughput portfolio revenue had another strong quarter, growing 33% year-over-year, with robust growth in both sequencing consumables and instrument shipments in Q1. MiSeq, MiniSeq and HiSeq all generated year-over-year and sequential growth in consumables as well as instrument placements. Our low-throughput platforms continue to be a compelling entry point for new-to-NGS customers with an ever-increasing number of use cases. One interesting customer example is Blue & Blue [ph], a startup using our technology in the development of cell cultured seafood to support sustainability and oceanic diversity. Additionally, these instruments play a critical role in catalyzing localized COVID surveillance programs across the globe. Turning to our Clinical and Research and Applied segments. Total sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was up 26% year-over-year, demonstrating strong demand for sequencing across both Clinical and Research segments, more than 44% of our sequencing consumable shipments in the first quarter of 2021 were to clinical customers. Clinical testing showed significant growth with consumables up 35% year-over-year. These results do not include COVID surveillance, which is reported in our Research and Academic segment. Oncology testing exceeded our overall clinical growth rate and is our largest and fastest growing clinical segment. This growth was driven by our customers benefiting from expanded access to reimbursement for NGS-based testing, particularly in comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, for therapy selection and some of the first reimbursement for sequencing-based monitoring tests. TruSight Oncology 500, our RUO comprehensive genomic profiling assay, continued its success this quarter, adding over 20 new customers. In February, the Belgian Society of Medical Oncology announced that they will use TSO 500 for a national pilot to evaluate the use of CGP for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. As a leading distributable CGP assay, TSO 500 continues to offer a compelling choice for our pharmaceutical partners. We announced last week an exciting new partnership with Kartos Therapeutics, to develop a TP 53 companion diagnostic, expanding the TruSight Oncology offering into blood cancers. Beyond CGP, we've seen promising developments in the use of whole genome sequencing in cancer treatment this quarter. Most notably, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine published by our partners at Washington University, St. Louis, showed that for AML and MDS patients studied, whole genome sequencing using Illumina technology produced more accurate results in less time and at a similar cost compared to standard techniques like fish or karyotyping. In reproductive health, the cascading effect of the ACON guidance on increasing coverage of NIPT for all pregnancies drove the third consecutive quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth. In the U.S., two large payers, Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, expanded their coverage criteria to include twin pregnancies just last month. And in March, we reported out on the results of our groundbreaking, risk-sharing, real-world study with Harvard Pilgrim, demonstrating the cost effectiveness of offering NIPT to all pregnant women. These studies add to the building momentum for broader access to NIPT. International support for NIPT coverage also continues to grow, fueling the continued rapid adoption of our CE-IVD marked NIPT kit. For example, there was positive news from Italy and Sweden, where new coverage requirements were approved during the first quarter of 2021. Moving to genetic disease testing. Customers are choosing Illumina's highly accurate and scalable sequencers, and our growth rate in this segment exceeded the company's growth rate in Q1. We also continue to see new favorable coverage decisions being issued. This quarter, two major health insurers in Germany announced that they will cover the cost of whole genome and whole exome sequencing for rare disease for their over 10 million members. And Geisinger in the U S expanded coverage to include epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Research continues to demonstrate a 40% to 68% diagnostic year for children suspected of having a genetic disease, and whole-genome sequencing is used as a first-tier test. The increasing coverage of these tests will provide more patients with faster diagnoses and better care. Turning to our research and academic segment. We saw strong growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period, as the majority of research and academic customers have returned to the lab. The pandemic and emerging variants of concern have raised awareness within governments around the world about the essential role that genomic pathogen surveillance plays in the fight against infectious disease. We're seeing investment globally in the creation of a pathogen surveillance infrastructure to manage outbreaks and improve health outcomes, including sequencing capabilities to determine the spread of pathogens, the emergence of variant strains and emerging drug or vaccine resistance. In the US, the American Rescue Plan Act includes $1.7 billion in funding for the CDC to improve sequencing capacity to identify mutation and circulation of viruses. In Europe, the EC announced \u20ac123 million commitment to combat COVID variants. In India, the government launched the Indian SARS-CoV-2, Genomic Consortia, with a plan to sequence 120, 000 viral genomes over the next four months. This investment in sequencing for national genomic surveillance activities drove approximately $55 million of incremental revenue in the first quarter, comprising of $35 million in instrument placements and $20 million in sequencing consumables. As countries around the world battle the pandemic, we expect continued investment in genomic pathogen surveillance to expand national genomic epidemiology capabilities. While the initial focus of this infrastructure is COVID surveillance, there are durable longer-term needs, including tracking future emerging natural pathogens, bio terrorism, antimicrobial drug resistance and hospital-acquired infections, and determining how host genetics can impact the risk and severity of infectious disease. While the pandemic has certainly fueled demand for our sequencing, we also believe it has established a new baseline of awareness and infrastructure build out that will support sustained activity. As we work through the COVID-19 pandemic, we're also seeing acceleration in several population genomics programs, expanding our presence in national health systems around the world. In the US, all of us ramped up sample volumes in Q1 to a level that we expect to continue throughout 2021. In Japan, the Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization chose Illumina sequencing for a 40,000-sample multigenerational study to take place this year. In February, Egypt announced the first population genomics program in Africa, with the launch of their Egyptian genome project. This project is focused on establishing a map of the Egyptian human genome, with the goal of ushering the country into the world of precision medicine. Large population health initiatives serve as one good example of our focus on improving the health of patients, communities and our planet. Earlier this month, we published our second annual CSR report, outlining our specific commitments to help improve our world. This 2021 report is available on our website, and notable highlights include: expanded transparency on U.S. diversity demographics, climate resilience planning, disclosure on trade group membership and data assurance on energy and emissions. We look forward to continued investor feedback on the evolution of our environmental, social and governance programs. Our commitment to the advancement of human health is an Illumina core tenet, which brings me to GRAIL. We are pleased with the progress GRAIL is making and remain committed to pursue the completion of the GRAIL acquisition. GRAIL recently presented affirmative data from its CCGA 3 study at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, and is expecting to launch Gallery, its breakthrough multi-cancer early detection screening test in Q2. One of the many reasons we decided to acquire GRAIL was to accelerate patient access to breakthrough multi-cancer early detection blood tests, which could save tens of thousands of lives. We are committed to supporting all our customers and strongly believe that our acquisition of GRAIL is pro competitive. We expect the acquisition to accelerate the early detection of cancer market as a whole. We saw a similar dynamic play out in the noninvasive prenatal testing market, where, after Illumina's entry, the market grew and prices decreased, making these important tests accessible to a much larger population of pregnant women. And now I'll turn it over to Sam. Thank you, Sam. Illumina is off to a very strong start to 2021, and it's clear that momentum is building across our customers globally. We witnessed the diversity and strength of our growing community in our first annual customer conference over the last couple of days. About 8,500 people registered to hear from the world's leading genomic and healthcare pioneers, including Jennifer Doudna, Francis Collins, Bill Gates, Frances Arnold and James Suhail. The topics included the critical role of genomics in fighting the pandemic, making genomics a foundational element of a national standard of care, integrating multiomic readouts and harnessing the power of AI and machine learning in oncology, among others. From battling cancer to genetic disease diagnosis, defining the pandemic, the transformative impact genomics will have on human health is accelerating, and we, at Illumina, are proud of the key role that our customers, partners and employees are playing in making it happen. Now I'll invite the operator to open for Q&A. Great. Well, thanks for your questions, Puneet. I'll start by saying that, it is -- it's exciting to see how the world is sort of moving forward with putting out a surveillance infrastructure for pathogens. It's something, as you know, Puneet, we've been talking about from the beginning of last year and talking about the fact that in addition to testing, what we really need is this genomic epidemiology infrastructure. So it's encouraging to see that play out around the world and to see the big commitments here made in the U.S. Now to get to your question, in terms of what we're building into this year, the vast majority of the growth in that 25% to 28% is coming from our core business. So the way we've modeled this year is we said, look, we expect small contributions from the surveillance infrastructure over the course of the whole year. We saw some investment in Q1. And so we saw a bolus of $35 million in instrument purchases that we got in Q1 to lay out some of that infrastructure, and we saw some consumables infrastructure. So in terms of our model, we continue to model some consumable purchases over the course of the rest of the year, but not a lot in terms of additional infrastructure investment. Now the way we expect it to play out is we are seeing the bid commitment made even in the U.S. around the American Rescue Plan, and we expect some of that investment to be released towards the tail end of this year and start to play out more next year. And what's interesting is that this infrastructure, while it'll be very helpful in fighting the pandemic is really a durable plan by the nations that are rolling it out. And what they are thinking about is a long-term creation of a genomics-based pathogen surveillance infrastructure to help fight this pandemic and prepare as next -- for the next outbreak, whether it's a natural outbreak or bio terrorism or emerging antimicrobial resistance or hospital acquired infections. And so we do expect, as you point out, some tail on this. It's not a story of this year. In fact, we've modeled in very little this year, but it really is a story that plays out into next year and going forward. And so that's how thinking about it in terms of model. Obviously, as more details come out, we'll make sure to share them with you. In terms of GRAIL, as I said, we are committed to pursuing the acquisition of GRAIL. In the U.S. that means we are taking our case into district court. And we're also working with the European Commission on their review of the GRAIL acquisition. We continue to feel that the facts are on our side, the law is on our side. And we continue to expect that the deal will close and will close in the second half of this year. Great. Hey, Doug, so let me take both parts of your question. I'll talk first about our acquisition strategy, specifically touching on any impact from our experience with the FTC and how it changes power philosophy going forward. And then I'll talk about guidance for the rest of the year. And Sam may contribute then, too. So first, by saying, if you look at our acquisitions over the last couple of years, we have -- we attempted the PacBio acquisition, I think, so that three years ago, initiated that, and we obviously didn't get that through the FTC. But we were successful in closing the Edico acquisition, which was a huge success in terms of building in the DRAGEN technology into our sequencers and has been super well received by our customers, and so really create a positive momentum on the informatics side. We also completed, for example, the Enancio acquisition and brought lossless data compression technologies and capabilities into our -- into our sequencers as well. And so what we're seeing is we've had success in terms of buying innovative technologies that we can build into our sequencers and take to market. But we're also seeing that given how popular our sequencers are in our core market that we have work to do in terms of some of these bigger acquisitions. And so one, I think we're going to continue to scan the marketplace and look for acquisitions that make sensible technology tuck-ins, as well as from, time to time, larger acquisitions that make sense. We continue to believe that vertical acquisitions are well within bounds, and that's where we're going to go to court on the GRAIL acquisition. And we also recognize that given the scale we are and given our position in the market, we will have to do more work in terms of educating the regulators about our business and making sure they are up to speed on our business even before we do an acquisition. So that's another takeaway over the last couple of years. Strategically, though, I'd say, we're still continuing to focus on making sure that we are looking for places where we can allocate capital, both internally and externally, that deliver maximum shareholder value. And that focus hasn't changed at all. In terms of our guiding philosophy for the year, I think you touched on a couple of important points. It's a balanced point of view, we feel, that on the one hand, recognizes that we're coming into the year and we're coming off the quarter with a huge amount of momentum in our core business. So if you look at both the clinical side of the business and the research side of the business, we're seeing real strength, and that's showing up in terms of the revenue numbers that we had in Q4, but obviously, also in Q1, it's showing up in the orders numbers, it's showing up in the instrument, the huge instrument growth rate we saw year-on-year in Q1. And so a huge amount of momentum in our core business. You add to that, we're seeing very positive signs from the COVID surveillance add-on business. And so on the one hand, with the huge amount of momentum going into the rest of the year, but as you point out, there's still uncertainty because we're still dealing with the pandemic. And so we're still watching to see how the pandemic plays out as countries are grappling with the third wave and a fourth wave, and that could have impact on people's ability to go into the labs or run their clinical sequencing that they that they need. And so we're balancing those two. And the numbers we put out, although they are big numbers, we have confidence in and we think it strikes that appropriate balance. I don't know, Sam, if you have anything else to add. Great. Thanks, Tycho. All right. Had a bunch of questions in there, so let me make sure I capture them all. I will -- so first, you asked us about the strength we're seeing from the instrument portfolio, let's comment on what's driving that. Then you asked about COVID surveillance and said, look, we talked about, we will represent about 70% of the surveillance testing that was done and how is that playing out since we last talked about the numbers, which instruments play best for that. And then, sort of, a commentary on the competitive landscape. Okay. So let me start with instrument strength. Yes. We talked about the fact that we had enormous instrument strength in Q1, so more than doubling year-over-year in terms of the revenue in Q1 that we got from sequencing instruments, a huge amount of strength. And what's driving that is the strength in the core businesses, both the clinical side and the research side. We talked about the strength that we saw on the clinical side in oncology testing. That oncology testing, as a segment, is now not only our largest clinical segment, but it's actually our fastest-growing segment. And there's lots of drivers behind the strength in the oncology segment, right? And more broadly in the clinical segment. One of the big drivers is, we saw a very significant step forward in reimbursement across a number of clinical segments last year. Genetic disease testing, oncology, NIPT. And so what's happening is that the addressable market, in terms of people who have access to the tests in a reimbursed way, has expanded last year. And so that's driving increased business for our customers in the clinic, and that's driving their purchases. Other dynamics that are playing out are the strength of the clinical business in China, for example, and the clearance we received from the NMPA around NextSeq, and that's driving an instrument growth. And so, it's not catch up. It's just -- the market continues to build, right? So with more reimbursement, the addressable market expands. With more cleared products, the addressable market expands in terms of our ability to place instruments into hospitals, for example, in China. And that's really what's driving the instrument strength. And obviously, that's hugely exciting, because that talks well about future consumable spend from all the instruments that we placed in Q1. In terms of COVID, and what we talked about is if you look at GISAID or NCBI, you can track in terms of the number of genomes that are deposited, the platforms they have been run on. And so I think there was a helpful blog that came out in the last couple of days. I think Keith Robinson did a genomics clinic blog. And he did an analysis, and it's pretty close to what we did, too, which says that our share there is about -- it's gone up about 79%. Now of all the genomes in GISAID have been done on Illumina platforms. I think the next highest is O&T with about 17%, I believe, and that tapers off after that. And so similar, but maybe a little bit better than what we talked about last time. In terms of the instruments, there's a broad range of instruments that are being used for surveillance. Obviously, NovaSeqs are a very popular instrument in the high-volume shops. But we're seeing a lot of NextSeqs and MiSeqs being used as well. And so it's the blend, if you like, that are playing really well. In terms of competition, but there's always competition in the market. As you can imagine, a market that's this early and growing this quickly is going to continue to attract investment dollars. So like you were looking at some emerging players that are going to be investing in the next year or two, and I think you listed some of them, there are clearly players that are in the market right now, too, that we compete with. But that's been true every year. So I'd say every year, we face a new wave of venture-funded competitors. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and deliver more value to our customers. You're welcome. Yes. So as you point out, obviously, we work very closely with our customers, and we have terrific customers like FMI and Gardens and so on in oncology testing. And our perspective is that they -- if you were in the liquid biopsy space, so if you offer a blood-based test, you are actually more durable through the pandemic than many other types of clinical testing. And so some of our customers found very innovative ways in terms of mobile phlebotomy units or having home-based access to the test even for some patients. And that's possible if you have a blood test. And so in oncology testing, I think one of the stories of the pandemic is going to be that there was an acceleration of the acceptance of liquid biopsy, and I think that's a durable trend. I think we come out of the pandemic, and you'll continue to see the growth in liquid biopsy, because people realize that not only can you get high-quality results, but it's a much more patient-friendly way to do the test than a tissue-based test. So I think if possible, you'll see liquid biopsy being a preferred way to go. Now what that means, there isn't really a whole lot of catch-up to do in Q1 because you saw the durability of liquid biopsies. And so far and away, I think the biggest driver of the strength in oncology are things like: One, expanded reimbursement for things like CGP; two, the continued emergence of new therapeutics that leverage genomic biomarkers. And that's also showing up in terms of the companion diagnostic relationships that we're signing up for TSO 500. And then the availability of products like TSO 500 from us, from our -- from our partners that create products that make it easier for labs to stand up those steps. And so I think all of those factors are driving the durable strength in oncology testing, and there may be a little catch up, but frankly, if there was, it wasn't much, in my opinion. Yes. I think that's a good observation in terms of the fact that liquid biopsy or blood-based tests are used for various types of testing in oncology. So one type, as you point out, is multi-cancer early detection, which is what GRAIL does as well as other players that are looking to do that in the market. Another area that liquid biopsy is used is for therapy selection. So helping match patients -- cancer patients who were already diagnosed with the right therapies for them. We already have a product, a kit that serves that space. So our TSO 500 product is used for therapy selection. A completely different part of the market requires a different technology, looks for different things in the blood. And so liquid biopsy can be used for many things, but they're very different segments. And all of them are different and require sort of different technologies as part of a liquid biopsy approach. The answer is, we are going to continue to look at M&A going forward. It's going to be both technology tuck-ins that help us advance our mission and our strategic priorities and that could be a range of things. It could be technology tuck-ins. It look -- it could look for capabilities that extend the offerings as part of our sequencing offerings. And so we're going to continue to do that. Okay. So you got a few parts there. So I'll start, and we'll talk a little bit about COVID. And the question is, why not more, right? Because it's clearly there's now a very recognized value in terms of using sequencing for genomic pathogen-based surveillance, both for COVID and as a recognition that this infrastructure is going to be valuable for many, many, many years to come. So the question is, why not more? The second question you had is with arrays, have we bottomed out? Okay. So let's go to the first one. We absolutely sort of believe that we are laying an infrastructure here that's durable, that it's going to be an important part of all national -- major national health systems going forward. We absolutely believe that this infrastructure is going to be valuable, not just to protect the public health, but also from a national defense perspective. So we expect this is going to play out over a decade plus, right? And we are going to have, in most countries, some kind of genomic pathogen-based surveillance going forward. In terms of how we thought about it this year, so the way we thought about it this year, is we said, you see some bolus of instrument buying in Q1 and we expect -- that was the bulk of the instrument buying we should expect to see this year. And we've talked about the fact that many countries now, we engaged with them last year, they bought some sequencing. And so, for the rest of this year, we expect to continue to see consumable buying. But our expectation is what you saw, the bulk of the instrument buying for what's going to happen this year already happened. It is possible that more happens, and the things that would drive that are, obviously, the American Rescue Plan that talks about some very big numbers. Our expectations are that it's going to take a while for the details to be worked out. And so, while you'll see consumables being purchased over the course of the year, it won't really be towards the end of the year, we expect, that you'll start to see people talking about, okay, where are these 6 Centers of Excellence, how much sequencing infrastructure do they already have, how much additional hardware we need. And so it's going to be a story of the tail end of this year going into next year and beyond from an instruments perspective. And so that's how we thought about it. We'll keep you up-to-date if any of that accelerates over the course of this year. In terms of arrays, we did see some growth year-over-year. And there are different parts to that business. There's the direct-to-consumer part, and then there's sort of -- and maybe Sam will talk a little bit about how those parts play out. Yes. So, Thanks, Derik. So a couple of -- I guess, three questions, one around HiSeq, the second one about our guide, and then the third about stock-based comp. So I'll start talking with HiSeq, and then I'll turn it over to Sam to talk about the other two. So in terms of the HiSeqs, we -- well, when we first started the NovaSeq upgrade path, as you know, we talked about the fact there were 850 HiSeq customers that, over time, we expect that the majority -- the vast majority of them would move to NovaSeq. So between 2017 and then until the end of last year, we went from 850 that had to upgrade, and then we refresh the numbers and shared with you that we are now left with 320 that had to upgrade. And so that upgrade continued in Q1. I don't think there was a bolus or a catch-up. I think it was more of a steady course of upgrade as we've continued to see, and we expect to continue to see that play forward over the quarters of this year and going into future years. So there was definitely continued upgrading, but there wasn't really a giant bolus or a catch-up that happened. So now I'll turn over to you, Sam. Yes. And thanks, Sam. And maybe, Derik, I'll give you some more color on NovaSeq because the reality is we're seeing a huge amount of momentum in the NovaSeq business. So we talked about the fact that in Q4, we saw our highest order quarter for NovaSeq, since we first launched that product in Q1 of 2017, which is really impressive because we're entering the fifth year of NovaSeq, right? So we had huge amount of momentum in Q4, record orders, again, second only to when we launched. And then in Q1, we again had a huge amount of momentum. Just talked about the fact that it was our strongest placement order for first quarter of any year since we've launched NovaSeq. So you're absolutely right. We're seeing this huge amount of momentum. Now what's driving that? I talked about the fact that it wasn't any kind of catch-up in terms of upgrade. And what's interesting, and we called this out before, an it's continued, is that we're seeing a huge amount of strength from new to Illumina, new to high throughput customers. And that's something we didn't expect when we launched NovaSeq. About half -- were going to come from labs that were fundamentally enabled by the democratization of sequencing that we NovaSeq represents, and that continues the launch of version 1.5. And so what we're hearing from the market is 1.5 really catalyzed the elasticity of demand and was the accelerant that drove those large amount of orders of NovaSeq in Q4 and the placements that we saw in Q1. Yes. Sure, Patrick. Thanks for the question. So with regards to profitability, I mean, as you saw in terms of both our guidance and also results in Q1, obviously, we've made pretty significant strides here in terms of improving the profitability or building on the profitability of the business. And that's -- that goes with our -- as we mentioned all along, that as the volumes start to ramp, and we saw significant strength in the business in terms of the core business and some contribution from COVID, we're seeing leverage improvement. We saw in Q1 that operating margins were north of 30%. We're expecting approximately 26.5% for the year. And we're expecting that to improve as we look forward over time. What are some of the things that are maybe the contributors to that and the ingredients to that? Obviously, gross margins, which have improved since our last guidance, and we'll continue to improve as we get past some of the COVID aspects related to higher freight expenses, for instance. Obviously, as volumes have ramped, we're seeing improvements in gross margin. We are making investments, though, I want to mention in the business, both in terms of manufacturing capacity and in terms of OpEx investments. I mean, the growth that we're seeing in the business far exceeds our expectations, and we're incredibly encouraged by that. And we have to catch up in terms of making some investments in the infrastructure to catch up with some of the demand that we're seeing, both, as I said, in terms of manufacturing and in terms of OpEx, which is why we are -- we're committed to that. But as we look forward, we're also committed to improving leverage over time and getting back to historical levels. And we're still on that path. We made good strides in just one quarter, but we're still on that path. With regards to mid throughput -- was it mid throughput or low throughput? That was the question, sorry. Mid throughput. So with regards to the throughput, we're not at the stage yet where we can share what the expectations are for pull-through in terms of NextSeq 2000, NextSeq 1000. Suffice it to say, and I know you're asking more about consumables, but I can tell you, the level that we're seeing in terms of placements on mid throughput for 2000 and 1000 as well as 550 DX and 550, is incredibly encouraging. We're seeing record placements every quarter. We're expecting to continue at that level going forward to improve on those levels going forward. And so, when you're having -- still when you're early stage of the launch of this instrument and you're seeing this growth, it's really hard now to put a level of consumable pull-through range at this stage. So we have to still give it a few quarters before we can do that."

            "content": "As Francis outlined, first quarter revenue grew by 27% year-over-year to $1.093 billion, driven by 29% growth in sequencing and 15% growth in microarrays. Record revenue across all regions contributed to the first $1 billion quarter in the company's history. Total sequencing revenue reached a new high, with first quarter revenue of $979 million, growing 16% sequentially and representing 90% of total revenue. Sequencing consumables revenue grew 26% compared to the prior year period, driven by strong growth in clinical testing and demand for NovaSeq version 1.5 flow cells. Most clinical and research customers are running above pre-COVID activity levels, as Francis highlighted. COVID-19 surveillance initiatives contributed approximately $20 million in sequencing consumables revenue during the first quarter. Sequencing consumables also benefited by approximately $20 million from the timing of customer purchases during the first quarter. Sequencing instruments revenue grew 123% year-over-year, with revenue of $176 million in the first quarter, reflecting strong performance across all instrument categories. The first quarter marked another consecutive quarter of record mid throughput shipments, driven by strong adoption of NextSeq 1000 and 2000. COVID surveillance initiatives resulted in approximately $35 million of incremental instrument revenue due to some customers building additional capacity for genomic epidemiology. As expected, sequencing service and other revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to IVD partnership revenue recognized in the prior year period. Sequencing service and other words, roughly flat sequentially. Moving to regional results, the Americas delivered revenue of $562 million with 18% growth, compared to the prior year period. Revenue growth in the region was driven by strength in sequencing product revenue from clinical customers in oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing, and contributions from genomic epidemiology initiatives related to COVID surveillance. These items were partially offset by lower IVD partnership revenue as expected. EMEA delivered revenue of $305 million, representing 38% growth year-over-year. EMEA's performance was driven by strong sequencing demand for clinical testing applications that resulted in higher-than-expected sequencing consumables revenue in the first quarter and instrument demand by research customers, including initiatives for COVID surveillance and genomic epidemiology. Greater China revenue was $127 million, representing growth of 51% year-over-year and 32% sequentially due to continued strength in sequencing revenue, driven by clinical expansion in the region and growing demand in hospitals, including the successful launch of NextSeq 550Dx. Finally, APJ revenue of $99 million grew 29%, both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by sequencing consumables revenue growth in clinical applications, such as oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease testing, as well as end of fiscal year purchases. Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% improved sequentially by 360 basis points due to increased fixed cost leverage on higher volumes and a one-time inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin decreased 250 basis points due to IVD partnership revenue in the year ago quarter, higher freight costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and product mix, partially offset by fixed cost leverage on higher volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $420 million were up $81 million year-over-year, in line with expectations, due to increased performance-based compensation expenses, headcount growth and increased project spend during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly down sequentially, driven by an additional week in Q4 2020, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.1%, up from 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential improvement was better than expected due to higher revenues, gross margin and resulting increased fixed cost absorption in the quarter. Non-GAAP other expense of $3 million was $23 million lower sequentially as expected. This was due to fourth quarter gains on short-term investments that we sold as we repositioned our investment portfolio for the anticipated funding of the GRAIL acquisition. In addition, we had lower interest income in the first quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% was up from last quarter due to tax expense on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, partly due to the capital requirements associated with funding the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income was $147 million or $1 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $278 million or $1.89 per diluted share. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $282 million, DSO of 43 days compared to 50 days last quarter, driven by revenue linearity. First quarter 2021 capital expenditures were $42 million, and free cash flow was $240 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the first quarter. We ended the year with approximately $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we received approximately $1 billion in proceeds from bond issuances to fund the anticipated GRAIL acquisition. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 147 million. Moving now to 2021 guidance. We expect full year 2021 revenue to grow in the range of 25% to 28% or $4.05 billion to $4.15 billion. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an increase of approximately $858 million and a significant increase from our expectations earlier this year. For the full year 2021, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 29% year-over-year, driven by strong orders and instrument placements. This includes sequencing consumable growth of approximately 30% compared to 2020, driven by NovaSeq version 1.5 Reagent and growth in clinical markets. We expect sequencing system revenue to grow approximately 50% year-over-year, driven by NovaSeq placements to new to high throughput customers and continued HiSeq conversion, in addition to mid throughput demand across our NextSeq platforms. NovaSeq pull-through to be towards the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million. Our view is to grow approximately 5% compared to 2020. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to improve from 2020 levels, reflecting increased leverage on higher volumes, partially offset by product mix and IVD partnership revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We now expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 26.5%, reflecting our higher revenue expectations and our ongoing commitment to investment in research and development. We continue to maintain our focus on improving our core business operating margin leverage over time. We expect non-GAAP other income to be about $60 million lower than 2020, due to the gains realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower interest income on shorter duration investments in anticipation of the close of the GRAIL acquisition and interest expense from our recent bond issuances. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.05 and GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.97. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2021 to be approximately 148 million. Moving to the second quarter of 2021, we expect revenue to be up approximately 60% year-over-year due to the broader economic recovery and strength in our core business. We expect a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin due to the higher volumes and resulting leverage. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be down modestly on a sequential basis, due to mix and additional investments to support the higher-than-expected volume growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses did increase significantly on a year-over-year and sequential basis, due to investments supporting the growth of the business and research and development, as well as compensation-related expenses. Non-GAAP other expense to be modestly unfavorable on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. Non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 for the quarter and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. I'll hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. I think you hit it, Francis. I mean just to be very brief and add maybe a couple of comments. One is, we have a high degree of confidence about our guidance range. It is a balanced outlook for the year. What gives us a lot of that confidence, Doug, is the strength of the core business. We are enjoying tremendous strength in the core business, and that adds to the confidence that we have. I think the only potential headwind that I would call out or risk is the uncertainty related to the pandemic, as Francis mentioned. Yes. With regards to FX, Tycho. So for Q1, I would say, compared to Q1 of 2020, FX benefit contributed approximately 3% in terms of benefit year-over-year, and that was driven mostly by the euro and the RMB, so appreciation of those currencies. If we look at the full year, we're expecting that benefit to moderate as we look forward, so definitely, more of the benefit in the first half versus the second half. And we're expecting, for the full year, approximately, I would say, 2% in terms of overall benefit from currencies versus 2020. Yes. So I think the way you characterize the stay house [ph] is correct in the sense that the business is stabilizing, and we're seeing less of a negative -- definitely not a negative impact from arrays. We actually saw them grow in Q1. The fact of the matter is, DTC is now a very small part of our business. It's somewhere between 2% and 3% of our overall revenues. Back in 2018, DTC was a much bigger contributor to our overall revenue. So even though we're very pleased to see arrays growing in Q1, it's -- DTC specifically is less of a contributor, and we still see the mature arrays that we have, the mature business, whether it's agrigenomics or other applications continuing to grow as well and has continued to grow over time. Maybe to go to the last question that you had with regards to sequencing services and others, so let me explain the dynamics there, Tejas. Q1 over Q1 of last year, we do have a negative headwind related to a $25 million IVD licensing fee that we had in Q1 of 2020 that we didn't see in Q1 of this year. So that was a negative. And as you saw, sequencing and other were down for the quarter by 16%. As we look for the year, what our guidance assumes is no material licensing fees or IVD fees with regards to any significant transactions or partnerships, I should say, for the year. So we're expecting mostly sequencing service and other to be flattish for the year, quarter-over-quarter. And that's consistent with our original guidance that we had back in January. Yes. With regards to your other two questions, Derik, so first, let me talk about the linearity, which is I think what you're referring to with regards to the approximately $1 billion quarter. So first of all, let's keep in mind, for Q1, we did have a couple of, I would say, items that benefited Q1, one was with regards to the $35 million of instrument purchases with regards to COVID surveillance. We believe that was a one-timer in terms of building the infrastructure. We don't expect material instrument placements going forward with regards to COVID, at least. That's in our assumptions, in our guidance assumptions. The other one is we called it out, which was a $20 million roughly consumable purchases, what we're calling catch-up purchases in Q1. And because of the fact that the customers were maybe running a little bit lower on inventory and purchased by approximately $20 million higher than they would usually do, not a material amount, but some elements of that. So that's what elevates Q1. That's why Q2 is sequentially a step down. That's why the year and the second half is also not higher than the first half. The other contributor to the second half not being higher than the first half is the UK BioBank, which we expect to complete their sequencing in the second half. So actually, towards Q3, they will wrap up that project. So those are the contributions, and that's why I would say our linearity is flattish this year. With regards to stock-based compensation, I called out at the beginning of the year, roughly just over $50 million year-over-year impact from stock-based comp. That is now higher actually from an expense standpoint because also driven by our performance, our stock-based accruals, stock-based compensation accruals are actually higher. So we're expecting higher stock-based comp overall. So from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually north of that $50 million. We haven't called out 2022. It's still early to talk about 2022 for stock-based comp, but that impact, that negative impact, obviously moderates in 2022 versus 2021."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to an exciting start for Illumina and for genomics, and I'm pleased to announce that we've started shipping the first NovaSeq X Plus systems to customers. Later in my remarks, I'll share how we're scaling our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to ship 40 to 50 units in Q1 and over 300 units for the year.  First, I'll cover our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Illumina delivered fourth quarter revenue of approximately $1.1 billion and full year 2022 revenue of approximately $4.6 billion, in line with the upper end of our revised guidance range. We placed more than 3,200 instruments in 2022, increasing our installed base to approximately 23,000 instruments worldwide.  Delving now into each of our platforms, starting with high-throughput. We've had a fantastic customer response to the NovaSeq X series launch. Both orders and the advanced pipeline continue to grow. There's strong global interest with orders from more than 25 countries, 4x more than in the first quarter of the NovaSeq 6000 launch. We're also seeing stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers who are bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits.  The NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle. We also shipped more than 340 NovaSeq 6000s in 2022, with more than 1/3 of those instruments for oncology testing and nearly half to new to high-throughput or new to Illumina customers. Placements were strong in the first half of 2022 even after a record 2021. Second half placements were tempered by growing customer excitement for the NovaSeq X series. Across 2022, average consumable pull-through for the NovaSeq 6000 was approximately $1 million per instrument.  Moving to mid-throughput. In 2022, we shipped a record 1,215 instruments and saw the fourth consecutive record year for NextSeq shipments. The fourth quarter of 2022 was also the highest quarter on record for NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments. Customers appreciate NextSeq 1000/2000's unique capabilities as the only mid-throughput sequencer with built-in analysis and the first mid-throughput instrument to include the 2x300 kits. Close to 25% of NextSeq 1000/2000 units in 2022 were placed with new to Illumina customers.  For low-throughput, in 2022, we shipped approximately 1,670 instruments, bringing nearly 700 new customers to Illumina. Our low-throughput instruments consistently open new geographies and applications while serving as an effective entry point to sequencing.  Shifting to our markets. Our clinical markets currently include testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. In 2022, shipments to clinical customers represented 45% of core Illumina consumables. For 2022, oncology testing consumables grew 7% year-over-year from utilization of MGS-based molecular profiling across early detection, therapy selection and minimal residual disease. We see expanding opportunities for our oncology products globally. For our TruSight Oncology 500 distributed therapy selection assay, sample volume grew approximately 60% year-over-year across more than 500 accounts. And for 2023, we expect more than $100 million in revenue for TSO 500.  Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. Galleri is the only multi-cancer early detection test in a $40-plus billion market, and it had the fastest first year revenue ramp in cancer screening test history. GRAIL has established over 60 partnerships with leading health systems, self-insured employers and other health care stakeholders. In 2022 alone, more than 4,500 providers ordered the test, contributing to the more than 60,000 Galleri test orders that have been received to date.  The Galleri test has received FDA Breakthrough Designation and was recognized by Time as one of the best inventions of 2022, by The Atlantic as one of the Breakthroughs of the Year and by Fast Company as one of the world-changing ideas of 2022. Galleri was also featured in an AARP health story on game-changing medical breakthroughs, improving lives today. GRAIL expects this exciting momentum to continue and to translate into an expected revenue CAGR of 60% to 90% over the next 5 years.  Beyond oncology, genetic disease testing had a record quarter in Q4 and another strong year in 2022. For 2022, GDT consumable shipments grew 11% year-over-year, driven by broader adoption of whole genome sequencing globally and increased demand for rare disease treatment. We also saw additional evidence generation, with the European Society of Human Genetics updating its guidelines to recommend increased adoption of whole genome sequencing in diagnostics as well as increased coverage for rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases. Recently, 2 of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S., based on the number of patients served, announced that whole genome sequencing will be covered for patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases, starting this quarter.  And AIM Specialty Health, which provides lab benefits management services for more than a dozen regional health plans in the U.S. now considers comprehensive genomic profiling medically necessary for appropriate patients with advanced cancers. Tens of millions more Americans will be covered, a huge win for patients and our customers and for Illumina.  Turning to our research and applied markets. Consumable shipments represented 55% of core Illumina consumables in 2022. Boosting the diversity in genetic databases is a significant need for our customers as they work to understand the underlying cause of disease. Genomics, combined with clinical information, can increase drug discovery success by up to 150% and reduce costs by up to 50%. To achieve this, we need more samples over time and for more diverse populations. We recently announced an agreement with Amgen and its subsidiary, deCODE Genetics, to sequence the first 35,000 genomes in our collaboration with Nashville Biosciences. This sample cohort will represent the largest data set of African-Americans to date as we aim to accelerate equitable access to precision health therapies, and they've already begun sequencing the first samples.  Moving now to 2023. We're excited for this launch year and have now started shipping NovaSeq X Plus systems to our first customers. We're on track to ship 40 to 50 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1 and more than 300 instruments in 2023. To accomplish this, we boosted our operational capabilities. We've built state-of-the-art consumable manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Singapore and San Diego, adding 9 new production lines. At launch, we already have 2 to 3 months of inventory for each of the 6 core consumable SKUs.  In our instrument manufacturing facility in Hayward, we are fully staffed and ramping up production and capacity. Right now, there are more than 60 NovaSeq X instruments in various stages of the production process. All primary and secondary sequencing metrics are meeting or exceeding specifications. In addition, we've taken steps to ensure our supply chain is strong. We began adding and onboarding new suppliers 2 years ago to secure the material and component supply fueling NovaSeq X production. We're also equipping our global commercial team to guide our customers as they receive the first NovaSeq X shipments. In January, we brought together more than 800 sales team members in a 3-day training session, giving them new tools and insights to support customers as they accelerate genomics worldwide with this powerful new instrument.  The team is energized to bring these new capabilities to market and excited to see the outcome of years of preparation. We are confident that our organization's scale, reach and experience will enable our customers to sequence more samples, run more analyses and obtain more data than ever before. And NovaSeq X unlocks greater elasticity, we expect average pull-through for the X to comfortably exceed NovaSeq 6000 over time.  Illumina will remain focused on supporting our valued customers with transformative innovations and continue to advance our road map to accelerate the genome era. Customers' interest worldwide continues to be very strong, and they are eager to harness the capabilities of the X, the most powerful, most sustainable and most cost-effective sequencer ever developed to further unlock the power of the genome. You'll hear more about the customer experience and data at AGBT this week.  Now before I turn the call over to Joydeep, I'd like to thank him and welcome him to the role as Illumina's Chief Financial Officer. With over 2 decades experience in the industry, Joydeep brings strategic expertise, deep industry knowledge and extensive global business experience to the role. He is a proven and disciplined leader with a strong track record of creating value and an ideal partner to help drive the next phase of Illumina's growth.  I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep for more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook.\nJoydeep Goswami: Thanks, Francis, and thanks for the kind introduction. I'm excited to step into the role on a permanent basis and continue to work with all of you. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.08 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 7% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Non-GAAP earnings were $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $159 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were lower than expected due to approximately $87 million in incremental tax expense from the R&D capitalization requirements that were not repealed in Q4 2022 despite broad bipartisan support. The incremental tax expense includes approximately $80 million recorded in Q1 through Q3 that was ultimately not reversed in Q4.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.3% for the quarter and 26% for the full year 2022, which increased from 15.6% in Q4 2021 and 17.3% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million.  Moving to segment results. I'll start by discussing the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue was $1.07 billion, down 11% year-over-year or down 8% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was down 13% year-over-year. As expected, growth driven by pull-through on the increased installed base was offset by delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decrease in COVID surveillance revenue and headwinds from foreign exchange rates.  Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined 24% year-over-year to $146 million, driven primarily by the lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X. The decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments, which grew 31% year-over-year as we continue to see strong adoption by new to Illumina customers and demand for our new 2x300 kits that bring longer lead capabilities to our mid-throughput platform for the first time.  During the fourth quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $20 million in total revenue, comprised of $19 million in sequencing consumables and $1 million in sequencing instruments. This was in line with our expectations and down $30 million year-over-year, driven primarily by lower sample volumes. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $131 million was up 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.  Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas was $577 million, down 7% year-over-year, and EMEA revenue of $301 million represented a 14% decrease year-over-year or a 10% decrease on a constant currency basis. As expected, the base business in both regions was impacted by an anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research I mentioned earlier. We continue to see strong demand for NextSeq 1000/2000, with record shipments in the Americas up nearly 50% year-over-year, driven by strength across both research and clinical. In addition, NovaSeq Dx shipments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of launch with strong early demand by clinical customers in Europe.  Greater China revenue of $94 million represented a 22% decrease year-over-year or a 14% decrease on a constant currency basis. The region continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns that resulted in lower sample volumes year-over-year. We continue to expect our business in China to be impacted by headwinds from COVID-related disruptions, exchange rates and slowing GDP growth in the region, at least through the first half of 2023. Finally, APJ revenue of $93 million declined 10% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Strong growth across clinical markets was more than offset by the conclusion of a large research project in Japan and delayed high-throughput instrument purchases due to the introduction of NovaSeq X.  Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.3% decreased 430 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million were down $52 million year-over-year, primarily due to cost containment initiatives, lower performance-based compensation expense and a onetime partnership-related expense in Q4 2021.  Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $23 million for the quarter grew 130% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri as well as higher contributions from MRD pharma partnerships due to a milestone payment in Q4 '22 that GRAIL does not expect to repeat in Q1 2023. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $166 million and increased $35 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $147 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $88 million and free cash flow was $59 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash as of the close of the quarter included $991 million in net proceeds from the term notes issued on December 13, 2022, which will be used to repay upcoming debt maturities in 2023.  Moving now to 2023 guidance. We expect full year consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10% to approximately $4.9 billion to $5.03 billion. We expect full year 2023 core Illumina revenue to grow 6% to 9% to approximately $4.83 billion to $4.96 billion. These ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates. We expect quarterly revenue to ramp sequentially through 2023 with linearity trends similar to what we saw in 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000. GRAIL is expected to deliver revenue in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023, reflecting year-over-year growth of 82% at the midpoint, driven by accelerating adoption of the Galleri test.  For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $35 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect core Illumina sequencing instrument growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, driven by the NovaSeq X upgrade cycle and continued momentum in mid-throughput. We expect core Illumina sequencing consumables growth of approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the NovaSeq X launch as customers build consumables inventory and ramp utilization as well as continued growth in our mid-throughput consumables due to the growing installed base. This growth will be partially offset by further reduced COVID surveillance revenue.  We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $900,000 to $1 million per system in 2023 as customers transition to NovaSeq X. We expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000/2000 in the range of $120,000 to $170,000 per system in 2023 as the record instrument placements in '22 and continued strong placements in 2023 are brought fully online. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance.  We also expect revenue from COVID surveillance of approximately $30 million in 2023, which reflects a year-over-year headwind of $105 million or approximately 2 percentage points. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% in core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% for 2023. These margins reflect: one, an increase in core Illumina operating expenses from 2022, primarily driven by normalization of our performance-based compensation; two, a temporary decrease in gross margins as we launch NovaSeq X, consistent with what we saw in 2017 when we launched NovaSeq 6000; and three, an increase in GRAIL operating expenses due to the ongoing investments to support the FDA application, NHS trial and to continue to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  We also expect a consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 36%, which includes an approximately $75 million impact from the R&D capitalization requirements. If these requirements are repealed in 2023, we expect our 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million. And finally, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be approximately 160 million shares.  For the first quarter of 2023, we expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion for Q1 2023, reflecting a sequential decrease of 212 basis points from Q4 2022 at the midpoint, primarily driven by: historical seasonality of our core business due to year-end budget flushes not repeating in the first quarter; partially offset by an increase in high-throughput instrument shipments due to the launch of NovaSeq X in Q1; and a decrease in GRAIL revenue of approximately $5 million due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022.  We expect quarterly revenue to grow sequentially through 2023, driven by a ramp in NovaSeq X shipments and utilization, recovery from COVID disruptions in China, accelerating adoption of Galleri and an expected mitigation of macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of 2023. For the first quarter, we expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. We expect operating margins to improve throughout 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base.  We expect net other expense of approximately $9 million, primarily due to the interest expense on our new bond issuances. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 160 million shares, in line with fiscal 2023.  I'll now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Joydeep. Illumina continues to prioritize innovation. We know our customers invest in our road map, not just our instruments. I talked about the NovaSeq X series earlier. The X is a powerful catalyst for 2023 and beyond. We also prioritized sustainability. NovaSeq X features a 90% reduction in packaging waste and weight and a 50% reduction in plastic usage compared to the NovaSeq 6000. The enablement of ambient temperature shipping of reagents will result in nearly 500 tons of dry ice savings per year while significantly reducing waste streams for our customers. These improvements are game changers for our industry.  We're also excited to bring long-read capabilities to market through 2 upcoming products in our Illumina Complete Long-Reads offering. Our long-read human whole genome assay will be available in the first half of this year, while the enrichment panel will be available in the second half of this year. We recently announced that our enrichment panel will enable a comprehensive, high-accuracy, long-read view for as low as $600 per genome. More than a dozen customers have evaluated data from their own samples using Illumina Complete Long-Reads and their feedback has been strongly positive.  They find Illumina complete long-reads more convenient than other long-read technologies and more straightforward with flexible input requirements. They are impressed with the data accuracy, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers. Illumina Complete Long-Reads and NovaSeq X will continue to evolve the genomics industry. This year, we will celebrate Illumina's 25th anniversary. Over this quarter century, Illumina has remained at the forefront of a global genomics movement, and we're even more optimistic about the road ahead. We're honored to be driving a global health transformation with our customers. And together, we will seize the potential of the genome era.  I'll now invite the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Congrats on the permanent role, Joydeep. So my first question is, at AGBT, we saw that you had 150 orders as of this morning, and that's 10 more than what you had at the start of this year. So I just wanted to clarify sort of the number increase was only 10 versus what are the advanced pipeline prospects. Maybe if you can provide that number. Again, I appreciate that you're providing the full year 300-plus number, but last time, advanced pipeline prospects, I believe, were 200-plus so if you could clarify how much that increased by because the number increase here within a month was somewhat lower than what we had expected. And then I just wanted to clarify, Francis, on, what are you hearing from customers in those advanced pipeline prospects? What are they looking for at this point? How is -- what are they waiting for in order to convert their interest into orders? Are they looking for validation for customers, data or anything else? That would be super helpful.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. Thanks, Puneet. So let me start with the numbers, as you asked. So as we said, the customer demand for the X series has been very strong, exceeding our expectation. And you know that we recently shared, as you pointed out, that we had 340 instruments spoken for, between 140 in preorders and 200 in advanced pipeline. Now this momentum continued over the last few weeks in January, and we're currently at over 155 instruments in preorders and over 250 in advanced pipeline. So you've seen the progression as we work through January. Now going forward, we plan to update you quarterly, as usual, both on how we're doing with orders, but now as we've started shipping, obviously, we'll update you on shipments as well. What we're hearing from customers as we go through the pipeline is that they're incredibly excited about some of the things we expected them to be excited about. So they're excited about the power of the X series in terms of being able to run much -- many more samples concurrently than they could before. They're very excited about the economics associated with running the X.  And they're equally excited about the sustainability features that we put into the X, so the reduction in plastic and waste, but also the elimination of the need for dry ice as part of the shipping. All of these combined with the ease of use that they're seeing, so when we describe the specs to them at IGF, they got a sense of the power and the performance and the faster turnaround time. But one of the things that people have been, I think, pleasantly surprised about is they get to interact with the X is the investments we've made around ease of use of the workflow.  So this is even a significant step forward than the state-of-the-art with the 6000 before. And what that opens up is the ability for the sequencers to be used by a technical team that is not as -- doesn't necessarily require a degree in genomics, for example. And so that opens up workforce capabilities for them. Now what we're hearing from research customers is, increasingly, they're starting to see the X as a must-have in terms of being able to remain competitive for grants and grant dollars. And so we're starting to see people cost that into thinking about how they will apply for grants. On the clinical side, what we're hearing is that because of the superior workflow performance and cost associated with the X, clinical customers are designing their new assays and their new tests on the X with the anticipation that, that's how they'll roll out new testing. At the same time, they're starting to want to get familiar with the workflow so that they can plan a transition over on their existing tests. So that will take longer. So the first demand from clinical customers is about new testing that they want to do on the X. So that's some of the feedback we're getting from our customers.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. And maybe, Puneet -- thank you, first of all, for your kind words there. I think the other question you asked is what are customers waiting to convert from the funnel to the orders, right? And this is, remember, this is late-stage funnel so we have confirmed interest. They like what they see, as Francis mentioned, and they have line of sight to budget, right? So usually, it's the -- when are they going to get the budget? Maybe it's finishing up or confirming some of the grants, which then tips them over into orders. And we fully expect that, as we have seen in other years, to happen as we go through the year.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen.\nDaniel Brennan: Joydeep, congrats. Maybe first on the guidance. I believe at JPMorgan, you guys talked about the '23 guide reflected a conservative approach. I'm just wondering, just given the history in the back half of '22, have you learned anything? Has the process changed in terms of how you're guiding? Could you just walk through a little bit about the conservatism or however you want to quantify it, that's within the '23 guide? I know, Francis, you guys quantified a fair number of kind of headwinds. Just wondering how much maybe you baked in cumulatively for those headwinds or however you would kind of discuss the process and the conservatism. And then just, B, just on GRAIL. Would love an update assuming that the EC directive comes back here during Q1. I know you guys are going to apply for a stay, but I'm just -- if you can kind of walk us through the process as you see it. If you don't get a stay, then kind of what happens? And related to that, the GRAIL balance sheet. Just wondering, ultimately, if GRAIL has to be divested, how do we think about the capital that Illumina has to commit to that?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes, Dan. First of all, thank you. So in terms of '23 guidance, we have, as we mentioned earlier, right, pulled in a few things that were visible, of course, is, one, the transition to NovaSeq X. We have mentioned that this is -- demand is going to outstrip supply. And we've also told you about linearity, that we do expect the second half to be -- for revenue to step up in each quarter as the NovaSeq X gets out to market and people start bringing up the instrument and ordering NovaSeq X consumables. We also expect that -- we placed a large number of mid-throughput instruments late in 2022 and continue to expect to place additional NextSeq 1000/2000 instruments in -- throughout '23. So as those come online, right, then you would expect an increase in the consumables ramp up as we get through the year.  Also in 2023, we have talked a little bit about the recovery in China in the second half of the year. So we had seen China going into the end of '22 and then even the first quarter of 2023 with some COVID hangover and rollover from last year. So right now, we believe that those should abate. And we also have a lower impact of FX from first half from -- obviously, from first half into second half of the year. So for all those reasons, we do expect, even after taking into account some of the slowdown in recruitment that we have seen in large pop-gen projects, that we will see linearity and revenue step up throughout 2023. And I'll hand it over to Francis for the second part of the question.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. So Dan, in terms of the GRAIL process, we are expecting the divestiture order to come out at the end of Q1, so maybe beginning of Q2. And we are going to apply, if there isn't a stay associated with it pending the appeals, we're going to ask for one. And then we're going to pursue the dual track and we'd be pragmatic as we go down both paths. On the 1 hand, we're going to have a divestiture track where we work with the European Commission GRAIL and go down the path to -- on the divestiture sort of process. And we expect that to play out over the course of this year going into next year. And in parallel, we have our appeals, and we have 2 appeals underway. One is around the jurisdiction, and we expect a decision probably towards the end of this year and another one is on the prohibition order, and we expect a decision maybe towards the end of this year, maybe sometime into next year. And so those are the 2 paths.  In terms of the capitalization, part of the divestiture track is going to be around making sure that GRAIL is capitalized going forward. And that could be through a combination of strategic partners that invest in GRAIL. That could be a path. It could be a multistep path that includes initially investment into GRAIL from strategic partners heading towards an IPO. But all of that is dependent on what comes out in the divestiture order, and that's something we're still in conversations with. So we'll keep you updated as that makes progress.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDaniel Arias: I wanted to touch on GRAIL, too, if I may. Joydeep, on the dilution for 2023, the $670 million, I'm just curious how much flexibility you have to work with in that number and the investment associated with that number. Just with the point being that, obviously, the forecast for Galleri is tough to call at this stage in the game. So to the extent that the revenue picture were to start to look different down the road, I'm wondering just how much of what you might have to spend there might be variable in one way or another. And then Francis, on the GRAIL NHS project and part 1 of that study, the 140,000 asymptomatic population assessment. The documents from the NHS, if I remember correctly, stated that the initial results were expected to be available in late 2023. Is that still the time line we should be thinking about? I mean I'm just -- I'm thinking about your comment on potential IPO and just outcomes there and what might be important to that process.\nJoydeep Goswami: All right. Dan, thanks for the question. So in terms of the GRAIL dilution of about $670 million this year, right, a couple of points there. So a lot of that is going towards continuing to accelerate some of the clinical trials in advance of completion of the NHS trials, the submission to the FDA for the Galleri products and, of course, to ramp up the sales and marketing that is required as the product continues its successful commercial launch, right? They've had a really successful commercial launch.  The way we have projected revenues into next year and based on -- it's really based on the run rate that we have seen with Galleri as they have exited 2022 and some of what they had in the funnel into 2023 and certain assumptions of repeat testing around that. So given that, I will point out, and again, I will say that GRAIL is held separate, so Illumina and Francis and I don't really control their -- how they spend their money and how they operate the company.  But I will point out that in 2022, they have been very good with how they've managed to adjust operating expenses as revenues have been different from what their -- some of their original expectations were. So we have faith in GRAIL's management that they are -- they're good managers, they're good with how they allocate their money into the right places that really prioritize the clinical trials and the commercialization of the product.\nFrancis deSouza: And then, Dan, I'll respond about the NHS contracts. As you pointed out, the GRAIL team has a contract with the NHS that covers the 140,000-person clinical trial that is underway, but also covers the next phase pending performance of the trial. And so they've already got an agreement with the NHS that if the trial meets its performance criteria, that the NHS will roll this test out to 1 million participants in the U.K. over 2024 and 2025, and that will be paid for by the NHS. The time frame for that readout is the end of this year, maybe the beginning of next year. So it's still the time frame that was contemplated in the contract.\nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question with Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: I had a 3-part question here. Francis, one on revenues. If you look at Q1, I think the implied guidance, teens declines. So I think the back half implied is north of 20% year-on-year revenue growth to hit the high singles to low doubles for the annual. What gives you that back half ramp here when I look at this on a year-on-year basis? I know you mentioned the historical launch year as a comp. But can you just walk us through on the visibility you have on those numbers?  And Joydeep, one on margins here for you. Why did gross margin decline sequentially Q-on-Q when I look at Q4 versus Q3? And if you start in Q1 at 17% op margins for core Illumina, is the implied exit rate for core Illumina in the high 20s when we look at Q4 '23?\nJoydeep Goswami: Listen, let me start and I'll give you some piece in terms of back half ramp on revenues, right? So let me start with the first half -- the first quarter and first half, right? We had very strong quarters in 2021 for the first half. We had record shipments of NovaSeq 6000s, if you remember, at the beginning of the year, still ramping COVID surveillance revenues. So this year, because in Q1, we are -- we've said we're going to ship about 40 to 50 NovaSeq Xs, which is far short of what our demand is for that.  You would expect that the first half of the year, growth rates are constrained as we ramp up NovaSeq X and we ramp up consumables purchases related to that. In the second half of the year, the story kind of flips a little bit, right? So you have much more kind of full -- approaching full throttle of NovaSeq X shipments. You have the incremental benefit of people bringing on NovaSeq X consumables. You also have some of the effects, which were headwinds this year, in terms of China COVID, in terms of overall COVID surveillance going down in the back half of the year. So you're right, the percentage growth rates in the latter part of the year and the actual revenue both start to step up in the second part of the year. So hopefully, that part is clear. In terms of margins, so let me talk about gross margin first. Gross margin declines quarter-over-quarter and, of course, this being a launch year, primarily due to the impact of -- especially if you look at quarter-on-quarter, is really due to the impact of launching NovaSeq X in Q1, which, as we had told you, would start off this year with a lower margin. We expect that margin to continue to improve as we go into the latter part of 2023, as we have much more utilization of the factories and, of course, we start squeezing out efficiencies in the process, as is normal.  And I think the same thing with operating margin. I think your question there was, you start off with a fairly low operating margin. For us, it's -- as both gross margin and the revenue profile improves, operating margin should improve as we go into the second half of the year. And that's mostly just math in terms of much better revenue profile to cover operating expense, which remains relatively flat as we go through the year. So hopefully, that helps you understand a little bit of how we've thought through the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: So 2-parters here. First on GRAIL, Francis, just going back to Dan's question there. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that $670 million in OpEx this year is specifically related to that NHS clinical trial that presumably drops out starting in '24? And is there the possibility of a delay or a period of evaluation as the results come in from that before that 1 million paid pilot launches? And then second on NovaSeq X pull-through assumptions, if I look back to the 6000 launch, you guys were approaching almost 1 million in pull-through about 6 quarters into the launch. So is there any reason why you couldn't sort of easily exceed that, say, 6 quarters into the X launch or the back half of '24, should that number be sort of 1.3 million, 1.4 million-plus. Is that fair?\nFrancis deSouza: So thanks for the question, Tejas. Let me take some, and then Joydeep will chime in if he has anything to add. So let me start with the GRAIL question and around how much of that $670 million is associated with the NHS trial and is there a chance that the readout is delayed or the next phase is delayed. So a portion of it is, so we haven't actually broken out that $670 million. A portion of it is, but it's not the majority of it. So there are a number of things going on at GRAIL. In addition to the NHS trial, there is also the studies they're doing for the FDA submission, and they are looking to have the final submission done towards the end of next year. And so they're sort of in the thick of things with the FDA. However, there is the part associated with that NHS trial. And as you point out, that moves from being a pure cost to GRAIL right now for this 140,000-person trial to next year being a paid rollout, starting next year over 2 years to 1 million people. So a pretty significant shift in economics positively for GRAIL next year.  In terms of the time frame, the NHS did a very thorough sort of diligent job with GRAIL in terms of planning out this trial. And because GRAIL has done so many studies of such significant size before, they really had a good handle on how to analyze the data coming in and sort of what you would need to get to get to the decision that they're looking for. And so we don't expect and we haven't seen at this point any delays associated with the analysis that's happening of the data. And so we fully expect them to be getting to that readout at the end of this year, beginning of next year.  And then similarly, because of the power of this test and the NHS being so keen to really use this test as a core component in their war on cancer, their intent is to get through the readout as responsibly and quickly as possible. And once the demonstrated meets the performance criteria, to get to that rollout as quickly as possible. And so there's a huge motivation on the side of the NHS again because of the potential life-saving benefits of this test. And obviously, there's motivation on the GRAIL side, too. And so I don't expect there to be any delays that pop up between the readout and then rolling out the test.  In terms of the 6000 pull-through then, what we have said, and you've seen this before, is really we expect some time likely between the first and second year for us to get to a stable point in terms of pull-through. And you pointed that out that we got there on the 6000 in that kind of time frame. And so one, we do expect that to be the time frame and we'll keep you updated as we work through the process. And as you know, but for everyone else, before that, the numbers are still too volatile for it to be a useful modeling metric because as you put out a whole bunch of new instruments and people start to ramp up, the pull-through can move pretty significantly from 1 week to the next, 1 quarter to the next.  And so it takes that year for you to get enough instruments out there for the number to be significant. Now also, as you pointed out, as we get to a stable number for the X, we feel really confident that the ultimate pull-through number on the X will be comfortably above what we had with the 6000 because of the power of the X and the quick turnaround time and the ability to run just so much more on an X over a year.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question with Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\nSung Ji Nam: Another one on GRAIL. Would love to get your thoughts, Francis, in terms of you talked about the FDA Breakthrough Designation for the Galleri test kind of -- I know -- but it's still kind of an uncharted territory to get it going through the FDA process and also maybe gaining broader reimbursement from Medicare. So could you kind of talk about kind of what efforts are being made in order to move forward with those -- in that direction?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, sure. So let me talk about a few things. One, as you pointed out, GRAIL has been able to get Breakthrough Designation from the FDA. And they have been working now with the FDA for a number of years on designing the studies that will be part of the ultimate submission. And so they've been working collaboratively with the FDA. And although they've been working with them, they've already submitted some of the modules associated with the FDA submission, and they are planning to do the final module submission at the end of next year, maybe extending into the beginning of the year after. So they're making good progress. The other big step with the FDA, which really breaks new ground, is that they've been talking to the FDA about submitting data from the NHS trial as part of the FDA submission. Now that's really powerful because that's a very large trial. And so that continues to add to the bolus of evidence that GRAIL was able to get and submit into the FDA. And so I think it's -- we're starting to see the benefits of that good working relationship between GRAIL and the FDA.  And as you know, when you have the FDA approval, that's a pretty significant step forward in terms of getting broad reimbursement in the United States, which is a really, really big value creation point from a GRAIL perspective. So you'll see both things play out in the next couple of years. You'll see the big NHS move from going from a trial to a rollout, a population rollout, starting with the 1 million people and then going population-wide after the 1 million people rollout in the first 2 years. And at the same time, you'll see the progress in the U.S. with the final FDA submission at the end of next year and then the path towards broad reimbursement in the U.S.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and hear from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Congrats again to Joydeep. So 2 I'll just ask upfront. Many of the lab companies that we cover are talking about reduced cash burn, and they're really excited about NovaSeq X and how even some of them are kind of excited about going from NovaSeq from NextSeq. So can you help us reconcile their desire to reduce cash burn and your expectation of increased spend with you?  And then just my second one is just continuing on some of the price stuff. Why should we not be concerned about the new $99 Complete Genome -- Complete Genomics thing today?\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you for the question, Dave, so let me go through them in order. So first, we're hearing just like you're hearing from lab companies that are really excited about the -- again, it's the power, the performance, the turnaround time, but also the economics associated with the X. And I talked about the fact that increasingly, people are going to see those economics as table stakes for applying for and winning new grants. But for lab companies, too, especially in this environment, as they are looking to squeeze the most out of their operations, they see the X as a path to get there, and the superior economics will help them as they lower cash burn and reduce their capital needs going forward. And so we fully expect that to be part of the conversation with our customers.  Similarly, we're seeing that on the NextSeq side, right? So we're seeing customers that are seeing more demand come in. And the question for them is do they buy the next NextSeq or do they fundamentally transform their cost structure and move to the X? And that's part of the reason why we're seeing a higher-than-expected demand from 2 segments: one, from the clinical segment, and we talked about the preorders coming in represent a higher percentage of clinical customers than we expected; and two, from new to Illumina and new to high-throughput customers. And so that dynamic is already showing up in the preorder number.  In terms of the competitive dynamics. One of the things that we're really excited about is that when we talk to customers, they get very quickly that when they're comparing what system to buy, they really look at -- they need to look at the total cost of ownership in terms of running these sequencers. And that's one of the unique things about the Illumina portfolio around that, started with the NextSeq 1000/2000 but now with the NovaSeq X, is that we have built in capabilities like the compute associated with the primary, secondary and, in some cases, even parts of the tertiary pipelines that are baked into and built into the instrument, that we've built into the instrument capabilities like lossless data compression.  And so when they start to compare prices, it's not just the cost of sequencing that they need to look at but it's also the associated compute costs, the storage costs that they would need if they had any other sequencer in the market. And one of the things that I talked about when we talk about the X is that just the compute savings you get associated with the NovaSeq X will save you over $1 million over a 4-, 5-year period. And so that's really exciting for them. Forget about the real estate requirements, forget about the time it would take to post process your data. All of those are important, but they also see that the total cost of ownership of the X is so much superior because of those built-in capabilities.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. I mean, Francis, just to dovetail on that, right, David, you had asked about, yes, there are cash constraints with people trying to reduce cash burn. But it's important to understand that, A, sequencing is at the very heart of the value that these companies are generating and even academic institutions are generating, right? So they want to do more sequencing because sequencing gives them answers that other technologies are not giving them and at scale. I think the second point that Francis mentioned is really important, right, that when they look at their cash burn, something like the X or a NextSeq 1000/2000 actually allows them to reduce their expenditure elsewhere, like things around storage or compute or other things, right, and allows them to redirect their investments more positively into areas that add value. And that's a really important point as you think through.  And then the third thing is just what they're doing in elasticity, demand elasticity or new applications that Francis and Susan and others have pointed out earlier, which is moving to things that they have not done with the NovaSeq 6000s or any other instruments before, which really then pulls through the elasticity that we are expecting to see starting in 2023 but really picking up in 2024 and beyond as the Xs become fully entrenched.\nOperator: And with that, that is all the time we have for our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Salli Schwartz for any additional or closing remarks.\nSallilyn Schwartz: Well, thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. You may disconnect.",

            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thanks, Francis, and thanks for the kind introduction. I'm excited to step into the role on a permanent basis and continue to work with all of you. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website.  In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.08 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 7% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Non-GAAP earnings were $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $159 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were lower than expected due to approximately $87 million in incremental tax expense from the R&D capitalization requirements that were not repealed in Q4 2022 despite broad bipartisan support. The incremental tax expense includes approximately $80 million recorded in Q1 through Q3 that was ultimately not reversed in Q4.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.3% for the quarter and 26% for the full year 2022, which increased from 15.6% in Q4 2021 and 17.3% in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million.  Moving to segment results. I'll start by discussing the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue was $1.07 billion, down 11% year-over-year or down 8% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was down 13% year-over-year. As expected, growth driven by pull-through on the increased installed base was offset by delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decrease in COVID surveillance revenue and headwinds from foreign exchange rates.  Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined 24% year-over-year to $146 million, driven primarily by the lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X. The decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments, which grew 31% year-over-year as we continue to see strong adoption by new to Illumina customers and demand for our new 2x300 kits that bring longer lead capabilities to our mid-throughput platform for the first time.  During the fourth quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $20 million in total revenue, comprised of $19 million in sequencing consumables and $1 million in sequencing instruments. This was in line with our expectations and down $30 million year-over-year, driven primarily by lower sample volumes. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $131 million was up 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.  Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas was $577 million, down 7% year-over-year, and EMEA revenue of $301 million represented a 14% decrease year-over-year or a 10% decrease on a constant currency basis. As expected, the base business in both regions was impacted by an anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research I mentioned earlier. We continue to see strong demand for NextSeq 1000/2000, with record shipments in the Americas up nearly 50% year-over-year, driven by strength across both research and clinical. In addition, NovaSeq Dx shipments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of launch with strong early demand by clinical customers in Europe.  Greater China revenue of $94 million represented a 22% decrease year-over-year or a 14% decrease on a constant currency basis. The region continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns that resulted in lower sample volumes year-over-year. We continue to expect our business in China to be impacted by headwinds from COVID-related disruptions, exchange rates and slowing GDP growth in the region, at least through the first half of 2023. Finally, APJ revenue of $93 million declined 10% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Strong growth across clinical markets was more than offset by the conclusion of a large research project in Japan and delayed high-throughput instrument purchases due to the introduction of NovaSeq X.  Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.3% decreased 430 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $528 million were down $52 million year-over-year, primarily due to cost containment initiatives, lower performance-based compensation expense and a onetime partnership-related expense in Q4 2021.  Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $23 million for the quarter grew 130% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri as well as higher contributions from MRD pharma partnerships due to a milestone payment in Q4 '22 that GRAIL does not expect to repeat in Q1 2023. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $166 million and increased $35 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $147 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $88 million and free cash flow was $59 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash as of the close of the quarter included $991 million in net proceeds from the term notes issued on December 13, 2022, which will be used to repay upcoming debt maturities in 2023.  Moving now to 2023 guidance. We expect full year consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10% to approximately $4.9 billion to $5.03 billion. We expect full year 2023 core Illumina revenue to grow 6% to 9% to approximately $4.83 billion to $4.96 billion. These ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates. We expect quarterly revenue to ramp sequentially through 2023 with linearity trends similar to what we saw in 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000. GRAIL is expected to deliver revenue in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023, reflecting year-over-year growth of 82% at the midpoint, driven by accelerating adoption of the Galleri test.  For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $35 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect core Illumina sequencing instrument growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, driven by the NovaSeq X upgrade cycle and continued momentum in mid-throughput. We expect core Illumina sequencing consumables growth of approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the NovaSeq X launch as customers build consumables inventory and ramp utilization as well as continued growth in our mid-throughput consumables due to the growing installed base. This growth will be partially offset by further reduced COVID surveillance revenue.  We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $900,000 to $1 million per system in 2023 as customers transition to NovaSeq X. We expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000/2000 in the range of $120,000 to $170,000 per system in 2023 as the record instrument placements in '22 and continued strong placements in 2023 are brought fully online. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance.  We also expect revenue from COVID surveillance of approximately $30 million in 2023, which reflects a year-over-year headwind of $105 million or approximately 2 percentage points. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% in core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% for 2023. These margins reflect: one, an increase in core Illumina operating expenses from 2022, primarily driven by normalization of our performance-based compensation; two, a temporary decrease in gross margins as we launch NovaSeq X, consistent with what we saw in 2017 when we launched NovaSeq 6000; and three, an increase in GRAIL operating expenses due to the ongoing investments to support the FDA application, NHS trial and to continue to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  We also expect a consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 36%, which includes an approximately $75 million impact from the R&D capitalization requirements. If these requirements are repealed in 2023, we expect our 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million. And finally, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023 to be approximately 160 million shares.  For the first quarter of 2023, we expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion for Q1 2023, reflecting a sequential decrease of 212 basis points from Q4 2022 at the midpoint, primarily driven by: historical seasonality of our core business due to year-end budget flushes not repeating in the first quarter; partially offset by an increase in high-throughput instrument shipments due to the launch of NovaSeq X in Q1; and a decrease in GRAIL revenue of approximately $5 million due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022.  We expect quarterly revenue to grow sequentially through 2023, driven by a ramp in NovaSeq X shipments and utilization, recovery from COVID disruptions in China, accelerating adoption of Galleri and an expected mitigation of macroeconomic headwinds in the second half of 2023. For the first quarter, we expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. We expect operating margins to improve throughout 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base.  We expect net other expense of approximately $9 million, primarily due to the interest expense on our new bond issuances. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 160 million shares, in line with fiscal 2023.  I'll now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. And maybe, Puneet -- thank you, first of all, for your kind words there. I think the other question you asked is what are customers waiting to convert from the funnel to the orders, right? And this is, remember, this is late-stage funnel so we have confirmed interest. They like what they see, as Francis mentioned, and they have line of sight to budget, right? So usually, it's the -- when are they going to get the budget? Maybe it's finishing up or confirming some of the grants, which then tips them over into orders. And we fully expect that, as we have seen in other years, to happen as we go through the year. Yes, Dan. First of all, thank you. So in terms of '23 guidance, we have, as we mentioned earlier, right, pulled in a few things that were visible, of course, is, one, the transition to NovaSeq X. We have mentioned that this is -- demand is going to outstrip supply. And we've also told you about linearity, that we do expect the second half to be -- for revenue to step up in each quarter as the NovaSeq X gets out to market and people start bringing up the instrument and ordering NovaSeq X consumables. We also expect that -- we placed a large number of mid-throughput instruments late in 2022 and continue to expect to place additional NextSeq 1000/2000 instruments in -- throughout '23. So as those come online, right, then you would expect an increase in the consumables ramp up as we get through the year.  Also in 2023, we have talked a little bit about the recovery in China in the second half of the year. So we had seen China going into the end of '22 and then even the first quarter of 2023 with some COVID hangover and rollover from last year. So right now, we believe that those should abate. And we also have a lower impact of FX from first half from -- obviously, from first half into second half of the year. So for all those reasons, we do expect, even after taking into account some of the slowdown in recruitment that we have seen in large pop-gen projects, that we will see linearity and revenue step up throughout 2023. And I'll hand it over to Francis for the second part of the question. All right. Dan, thanks for the question. So in terms of the GRAIL dilution of about $670 million this year, right, a couple of points there. So a lot of that is going towards continuing to accelerate some of the clinical trials in advance of completion of the NHS trials, the submission to the FDA for the Galleri products and, of course, to ramp up the sales and marketing that is required as the product continues its successful commercial launch, right? They've had a really successful commercial launch.  The way we have projected revenues into next year and based on -- it's really based on the run rate that we have seen with Galleri as they have exited 2022 and some of what they had in the funnel into 2023 and certain assumptions of repeat testing around that. So given that, I will point out, and again, I will say that GRAIL is held separate, so Illumina and Francis and I don't really control their -- how they spend their money and how they operate the company.  But I will point out that in 2022, they have been very good with how they've managed to adjust operating expenses as revenues have been different from what their -- some of their original expectations were. So we have faith in GRAIL's management that they are -- they're good managers, they're good with how they allocate their money into the right places that really prioritize the clinical trials and the commercialization of the product. Listen, let me start and I'll give you some piece in terms of back half ramp on revenues, right? So let me start with the first half -- the first quarter and first half, right? We had very strong quarters in 2021 for the first half. We had record shipments of NovaSeq 6000s, if you remember, at the beginning of the year, still ramping COVID surveillance revenues. So this year, because in Q1, we are -- we've said we're going to ship about 40 to 50 NovaSeq Xs, which is far short of what our demand is for that.  You would expect that the first half of the year, growth rates are constrained as we ramp up NovaSeq X and we ramp up consumables purchases related to that. In the second half of the year, the story kind of flips a little bit, right? So you have much more kind of full -- approaching full throttle of NovaSeq X shipments. You have the incremental benefit of people bringing on NovaSeq X consumables. You also have some of the effects, which were headwinds this year, in terms of China COVID, in terms of overall COVID surveillance going down in the back half of the year. So you're right, the percentage growth rates in the latter part of the year and the actual revenue both start to step up in the second part of the year. So hopefully, that part is clear. In terms of margins, so let me talk about gross margin first. Gross margin declines quarter-over-quarter and, of course, this being a launch year, primarily due to the impact of -- especially if you look at quarter-on-quarter, is really due to the impact of launching NovaSeq X in Q1, which, as we had told you, would start off this year with a lower margin. We expect that margin to continue to improve as we go into the latter part of 2023, as we have much more utilization of the factories and, of course, we start squeezing out efficiencies in the process, as is normal.  And I think the same thing with operating margin. I think your question there was, you start off with a fairly low operating margin. For us, it's -- as both gross margin and the revenue profile improves, operating margin should improve as we go into the second half of the year. And that's mostly just math in terms of much better revenue profile to cover operating expense, which remains relatively flat as we go through the year. So hopefully, that helps you understand a little bit of how we've thought through the year. Yes. I mean, Francis, just to dovetail on that, right, David, you had asked about, yes, there are cash constraints with people trying to reduce cash burn. But it's important to understand that, A, sequencing is at the very heart of the value that these companies are generating and even academic institutions are generating, right? So they want to do more sequencing because sequencing gives them answers that other technologies are not giving them and at scale. I think the second point that Francis mentioned is really important, right, that when they look at their cash burn, something like the X or a NextSeq 1000/2000 actually allows them to reduce their expenditure elsewhere, like things around storage or compute or other things, right, and allows them to redirect their investments more positively into areas that add value. And that's a really important point as you think through.  And then the third thing is just what they're doing in elasticity, demand elasticity or new applications that Francis and Susan and others have pointed out earlier, which is moving to things that they have not done with the NovaSeq 6000s or any other instruments before, which really then pulls through the elasticity that we are expecting to see starting in 2023 but really picking up in 2024 and beyond as the Xs become fully entrenched."

            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to an exciting start for Illumina and for genomics, and I'm pleased to announce that we've started shipping the first NovaSeq X Plus systems to customers. Later in my remarks, I'll share how we're scaling our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to ship 40 to 50 units in Q1 and over 300 units for the year.  First, I'll cover our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Illumina delivered fourth quarter revenue of approximately $1.1 billion and full year 2022 revenue of approximately $4.6 billion, in line with the upper end of our revised guidance range. We placed more than 3,200 instruments in 2022, increasing our installed base to approximately 23,000 instruments worldwide.  Delving now into each of our platforms, starting with high-throughput. We've had a fantastic customer response to the NovaSeq X series launch. Both orders and the advanced pipeline continue to grow. There's strong global interest with orders from more than 25 countries, 4x more than in the first quarter of the NovaSeq 6000 launch. We're also seeing stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers who are bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits.  The NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle. We also shipped more than 340 NovaSeq 6000s in 2022, with more than 1/3 of those instruments for oncology testing and nearly half to new to high-throughput or new to Illumina customers. Placements were strong in the first half of 2022 even after a record 2021. Second half placements were tempered by growing customer excitement for the NovaSeq X series. Across 2022, average consumable pull-through for the NovaSeq 6000 was approximately $1 million per instrument.  Moving to mid-throughput. In 2022, we shipped a record 1,215 instruments and saw the fourth consecutive record year for NextSeq shipments. The fourth quarter of 2022 was also the highest quarter on record for NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments. Customers appreciate NextSeq 1000/2000's unique capabilities as the only mid-throughput sequencer with built-in analysis and the first mid-throughput instrument to include the 2x300 kits. Close to 25% of NextSeq 1000/2000 units in 2022 were placed with new to Illumina customers.  For low-throughput, in 2022, we shipped approximately 1,670 instruments, bringing nearly 700 new customers to Illumina. Our low-throughput instruments consistently open new geographies and applications while serving as an effective entry point to sequencing.  Shifting to our markets. Our clinical markets currently include testing for oncology, reproductive health and genetic disease. In 2022, shipments to clinical customers represented 45% of core Illumina consumables. For 2022, oncology testing consumables grew 7% year-over-year from utilization of MGS-based molecular profiling across early detection, therapy selection and minimal residual disease. We see expanding opportunities for our oncology products globally. For our TruSight Oncology 500 distributed therapy selection assay, sample volume grew approximately 60% year-over-year across more than 500 accounts. And for 2023, we expect more than $100 million in revenue for TSO 500.  Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. Galleri is the only multi-cancer early detection test in a $40-plus billion market, and it had the fastest first year revenue ramp in cancer screening test history. GRAIL has established over 60 partnerships with leading health systems, self-insured employers and other health care stakeholders. In 2022 alone, more than 4,500 providers ordered the test, contributing to the more than 60,000 Galleri test orders that have been received to date.  The Galleri test has received FDA Breakthrough Designation and was recognized by Time as one of the best inventions of 2022, by The Atlantic as one of the Breakthroughs of the Year and by Fast Company as one of the world-changing ideas of 2022. Galleri was also featured in an AARP health story on game-changing medical breakthroughs, improving lives today. GRAIL expects this exciting momentum to continue and to translate into an expected revenue CAGR of 60% to 90% over the next 5 years.  Beyond oncology, genetic disease testing had a record quarter in Q4 and another strong year in 2022. For 2022, GDT consumable shipments grew 11% year-over-year, driven by broader adoption of whole genome sequencing globally and increased demand for rare disease treatment. We also saw additional evidence generation, with the European Society of Human Genetics updating its guidelines to recommend increased adoption of whole genome sequencing in diagnostics as well as increased coverage for rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases. Recently, 2 of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S., based on the number of patients served, announced that whole genome sequencing will be covered for patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases, starting this quarter.  And AIM Specialty Health, which provides lab benefits management services for more than a dozen regional health plans in the U.S. now considers comprehensive genomic profiling medically necessary for appropriate patients with advanced cancers. Tens of millions more Americans will be covered, a huge win for patients and our customers and for Illumina.  Turning to our research and applied markets. Consumable shipments represented 55% of core Illumina consumables in 2022. Boosting the diversity in genetic databases is a significant need for our customers as they work to understand the underlying cause of disease. Genomics, combined with clinical information, can increase drug discovery success by up to 150% and reduce costs by up to 50%. To achieve this, we need more samples over time and for more diverse populations. We recently announced an agreement with Amgen and its subsidiary, deCODE Genetics, to sequence the first 35,000 genomes in our collaboration with Nashville Biosciences. This sample cohort will represent the largest data set of African-Americans to date as we aim to accelerate equitable access to precision health therapies, and they've already begun sequencing the first samples.  Moving now to 2023. We're excited for this launch year and have now started shipping NovaSeq X Plus systems to our first customers. We're on track to ship 40 to 50 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1 and more than 300 instruments in 2023. To accomplish this, we boosted our operational capabilities. We've built state-of-the-art consumable manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Singapore and San Diego, adding 9 new production lines. At launch, we already have 2 to 3 months of inventory for each of the 6 core consumable SKUs.  In our instrument manufacturing facility in Hayward, we are fully staffed and ramping up production and capacity. Right now, there are more than 60 NovaSeq X instruments in various stages of the production process. All primary and secondary sequencing metrics are meeting or exceeding specifications. In addition, we've taken steps to ensure our supply chain is strong. We began adding and onboarding new suppliers 2 years ago to secure the material and component supply fueling NovaSeq X production. We're also equipping our global commercial team to guide our customers as they receive the first NovaSeq X shipments. In January, we brought together more than 800 sales team members in a 3-day training session, giving them new tools and insights to support customers as they accelerate genomics worldwide with this powerful new instrument.  The team is energized to bring these new capabilities to market and excited to see the outcome of years of preparation. We are confident that our organization's scale, reach and experience will enable our customers to sequence more samples, run more analyses and obtain more data than ever before. And NovaSeq X unlocks greater elasticity, we expect average pull-through for the X to comfortably exceed NovaSeq 6000 over time.  Illumina will remain focused on supporting our valued customers with transformative innovations and continue to advance our road map to accelerate the genome era. Customers' interest worldwide continues to be very strong, and they are eager to harness the capabilities of the X, the most powerful, most sustainable and most cost-effective sequencer ever developed to further unlock the power of the genome. You'll hear more about the customer experience and data at AGBT this week.  Now before I turn the call over to Joydeep, I'd like to thank him and welcome him to the role as Illumina's Chief Financial Officer. With over 2 decades experience in the industry, Joydeep brings strategic expertise, deep industry knowledge and extensive global business experience to the role. He is a proven and disciplined leader with a strong track record of creating value and an ideal partner to help drive the next phase of Illumina's growth.  I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep for more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Thanks, Joydeep. Illumina continues to prioritize innovation. We know our customers invest in our road map, not just our instruments. I talked about the NovaSeq X series earlier. The X is a powerful catalyst for 2023 and beyond. We also prioritized sustainability. NovaSeq X features a 90% reduction in packaging waste and weight and a 50% reduction in plastic usage compared to the NovaSeq 6000. The enablement of ambient temperature shipping of reagents will result in nearly 500 tons of dry ice savings per year while significantly reducing waste streams for our customers. These improvements are game changers for our industry.  We're also excited to bring long-read capabilities to market through 2 upcoming products in our Illumina Complete Long-Reads offering. Our long-read human whole genome assay will be available in the first half of this year, while the enrichment panel will be available in the second half of this year. We recently announced that our enrichment panel will enable a comprehensive, high-accuracy, long-read view for as low as $600 per genome. More than a dozen customers have evaluated data from their own samples using Illumina Complete Long-Reads and their feedback has been strongly positive.  They find Illumina complete long-reads more convenient than other long-read technologies and more straightforward with flexible input requirements. They are impressed with the data accuracy, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers. Illumina Complete Long-Reads and NovaSeq X will continue to evolve the genomics industry. This year, we will celebrate Illumina's 25th anniversary. Over this quarter century, Illumina has remained at the forefront of a global genomics movement, and we're even more optimistic about the road ahead. We're honored to be driving a global health transformation with our customers. And together, we will seize the potential of the genome era.  I'll now invite the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Thank you. Sure. Thanks, Puneet. So let me start with the numbers, as you asked. So as we said, the customer demand for the X series has been very strong, exceeding our expectation. And you know that we recently shared, as you pointed out, that we had 340 instruments spoken for, between 140 in preorders and 200 in advanced pipeline. Now this momentum continued over the last few weeks in January, and we're currently at over 155 instruments in preorders and over 250 in advanced pipeline. So you've seen the progression as we work through January. Now going forward, we plan to update you quarterly, as usual, both on how we're doing with orders, but now as we've started shipping, obviously, we'll update you on shipments as well. What we're hearing from customers as we go through the pipeline is that they're incredibly excited about some of the things we expected them to be excited about. So they're excited about the power of the X series in terms of being able to run much -- many more samples concurrently than they could before. They're very excited about the economics associated with running the X.  And they're equally excited about the sustainability features that we put into the X, so the reduction in plastic and waste, but also the elimination of the need for dry ice as part of the shipping. All of these combined with the ease of use that they're seeing, so when we describe the specs to them at IGF, they got a sense of the power and the performance and the faster turnaround time. But one of the things that people have been, I think, pleasantly surprised about is they get to interact with the X is the investments we've made around ease of use of the workflow.  So this is even a significant step forward than the state-of-the-art with the 6000 before. And what that opens up is the ability for the sequencers to be used by a technical team that is not as -- doesn't necessarily require a degree in genomics, for example. And so that opens up workforce capabilities for them. Now what we're hearing from research customers is, increasingly, they're starting to see the X as a must-have in terms of being able to remain competitive for grants and grant dollars. And so we're starting to see people cost that into thinking about how they will apply for grants. On the clinical side, what we're hearing is that because of the superior workflow performance and cost associated with the X, clinical customers are designing their new assays and their new tests on the X with the anticipation that, that's how they'll roll out new testing. At the same time, they're starting to want to get familiar with the workflow so that they can plan a transition over on their existing tests. So that will take longer. So the first demand from clinical customers is about new testing that they want to do on the X. So that's some of the feedback we're getting from our customers. Sure. So Dan, in terms of the GRAIL process, we are expecting the divestiture order to come out at the end of Q1, so maybe beginning of Q2. And we are going to apply, if there isn't a stay associated with it pending the appeals, we're going to ask for one. And then we're going to pursue the dual track and we'd be pragmatic as we go down both paths. On the 1 hand, we're going to have a divestiture track where we work with the European Commission GRAIL and go down the path to -- on the divestiture sort of process. And we expect that to play out over the course of this year going into next year. And in parallel, we have our appeals, and we have 2 appeals underway. One is around the jurisdiction, and we expect a decision probably towards the end of this year and another one is on the prohibition order, and we expect a decision maybe towards the end of this year, maybe sometime into next year. And so those are the 2 paths.  In terms of the capitalization, part of the divestiture track is going to be around making sure that GRAIL is capitalized going forward. And that could be through a combination of strategic partners that invest in GRAIL. That could be a path. It could be a multistep path that includes initially investment into GRAIL from strategic partners heading towards an IPO. But all of that is dependent on what comes out in the divestiture order, and that's something we're still in conversations with. So we'll keep you updated as that makes progress. And then, Dan, I'll respond about the NHS contracts. As you pointed out, the GRAIL team has a contract with the NHS that covers the 140,000-person clinical trial that is underway, but also covers the next phase pending performance of the trial. And so they've already got an agreement with the NHS that if the trial meets its performance criteria, that the NHS will roll this test out to 1 million participants in the U.K. over 2024 and 2025, and that will be paid for by the NHS. The time frame for that readout is the end of this year, maybe the beginning of next year. So it's still the time frame that was contemplated in the contract. So thanks for the question, Tejas. Let me take some, and then Joydeep will chime in if he has anything to add. So let me start with the GRAIL question and around how much of that $670 million is associated with the NHS trial and is there a chance that the readout is delayed or the next phase is delayed. So a portion of it is, so we haven't actually broken out that $670 million. A portion of it is, but it's not the majority of it. So there are a number of things going on at GRAIL. In addition to the NHS trial, there is also the studies they're doing for the FDA submission, and they are looking to have the final submission done towards the end of next year. And so they're sort of in the thick of things with the FDA. However, there is the part associated with that NHS trial. And as you point out, that moves from being a pure cost to GRAIL right now for this 140,000-person trial to next year being a paid rollout, starting next year over 2 years to 1 million people. So a pretty significant shift in economics positively for GRAIL next year.  In terms of the time frame, the NHS did a very thorough sort of diligent job with GRAIL in terms of planning out this trial. And because GRAIL has done so many studies of such significant size before, they really had a good handle on how to analyze the data coming in and sort of what you would need to get to get to the decision that they're looking for. And so we don't expect and we haven't seen at this point any delays associated with the analysis that's happening of the data. And so we fully expect them to be getting to that readout at the end of this year, beginning of next year.  And then similarly, because of the power of this test and the NHS being so keen to really use this test as a core component in their war on cancer, their intent is to get through the readout as responsibly and quickly as possible. And once the demonstrated meets the performance criteria, to get to that rollout as quickly as possible. And so there's a huge motivation on the side of the NHS again because of the potential life-saving benefits of this test. And obviously, there's motivation on the GRAIL side, too. And so I don't expect there to be any delays that pop up between the readout and then rolling out the test.  In terms of the 6000 pull-through then, what we have said, and you've seen this before, is really we expect some time likely between the first and second year for us to get to a stable point in terms of pull-through. And you pointed that out that we got there on the 6000 in that kind of time frame. And so one, we do expect that to be the time frame and we'll keep you updated as we work through the process. And as you know, but for everyone else, before that, the numbers are still too volatile for it to be a useful modeling metric because as you put out a whole bunch of new instruments and people start to ramp up, the pull-through can move pretty significantly from 1 week to the next, 1 quarter to the next.  And so it takes that year for you to get enough instruments out there for the number to be significant. Now also, as you pointed out, as we get to a stable number for the X, we feel really confident that the ultimate pull-through number on the X will be comfortably above what we had with the 6000 because of the power of the X and the quick turnaround time and the ability to run just so much more on an X over a year. Yes, sure. So let me talk about a few things. One, as you pointed out, GRAIL has been able to get Breakthrough Designation from the FDA. And they have been working now with the FDA for a number of years on designing the studies that will be part of the ultimate submission. And so they've been working collaboratively with the FDA. And although they've been working with them, they've already submitted some of the modules associated with the FDA submission, and they are planning to do the final module submission at the end of next year, maybe extending into the beginning of the year after. So they're making good progress. The other big step with the FDA, which really breaks new ground, is that they've been talking to the FDA about submitting data from the NHS trial as part of the FDA submission. Now that's really powerful because that's a very large trial. And so that continues to add to the bolus of evidence that GRAIL was able to get and submit into the FDA. And so I think it's -- we're starting to see the benefits of that good working relationship between GRAIL and the FDA.  And as you know, when you have the FDA approval, that's a pretty significant step forward in terms of getting broad reimbursement in the United States, which is a really, really big value creation point from a GRAIL perspective. So you'll see both things play out in the next couple of years. You'll see the big NHS move from going from a trial to a rollout, a population rollout, starting with the 1 million people and then going population-wide after the 1 million people rollout in the first 2 years. And at the same time, you'll see the progress in the U.S. with the final FDA submission at the end of next year and then the path towards broad reimbursement in the U.S. Thank you for the question, Dave, so let me go through them in order. So first, we're hearing just like you're hearing from lab companies that are really excited about the -- again, it's the power, the performance, the turnaround time, but also the economics associated with the X. And I talked about the fact that increasingly, people are going to see those economics as table stakes for applying for and winning new grants. But for lab companies, too, especially in this environment, as they are looking to squeeze the most out of their operations, they see the X as a path to get there, and the superior economics will help them as they lower cash burn and reduce their capital needs going forward. And so we fully expect that to be part of the conversation with our customers.  Similarly, we're seeing that on the NextSeq side, right? So we're seeing customers that are seeing more demand come in. And the question for them is do they buy the next NextSeq or do they fundamentally transform their cost structure and move to the X? And that's part of the reason why we're seeing a higher-than-expected demand from 2 segments: one, from the clinical segment, and we talked about the preorders coming in represent a higher percentage of clinical customers than we expected; and two, from new to Illumina and new to high-throughput customers. And so that dynamic is already showing up in the preorder number.  In terms of the competitive dynamics. One of the things that we're really excited about is that when we talk to customers, they get very quickly that when they're comparing what system to buy, they really look at -- they need to look at the total cost of ownership in terms of running these sequencers. And that's one of the unique things about the Illumina portfolio around that, started with the NextSeq 1000/2000 but now with the NovaSeq X, is that we have built in capabilities like the compute associated with the primary, secondary and, in some cases, even parts of the tertiary pipelines that are baked into and built into the instrument, that we've built into the instrument capabilities like lossless data compression.  And so when they start to compare prices, it's not just the cost of sequencing that they need to look at but it's also the associated compute costs, the storage costs that they would need if they had any other sequencer in the market. And one of the things that I talked about when we talk about the X is that just the compute savings you get associated with the NovaSeq X will save you over $1 million over a 4-, 5-year period. And so that's really exciting for them. Forget about the real estate requirements, forget about the time it would take to post process your data. All of those are important, but they also see that the total cost of ownership of the X is so much superior because of those built-in capabilities."

Illumina delivered revenue of $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and 3% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations despite deepening macroeconomic challenges. Looking at our Q3 performance across platforms, in high throughput, we shipped 65 NovaSeq 6000 in Q3, down from the prior year, in line with our expectations. We had a fantastic customer response to the NovaSeq X Series launch at the Illumina Genomics Forum, where we reached more than 12,000 viewers in our innovation road map sessions. Labs are excited by NovaSeq X's industry-leading power, efficiency and cost effectiveness and they love in their words, it's unexpected and revolutionary sustainability breakthroughs including ambient shipping and a 90% reduction in packaging, weight and waste. Customer traction for NovaSeq X is exceeding our expectations. We already have an advanced pipeline of more than 170 instruments in addition to 50 orders that we have already received. Our manufacturing scaling is proceeding well and we expect to ship 40 to 50 NovaSeq X units in Q1 2023 and over 300 units in the year. At the Illumina Genomics Forum, we also launched the NovaSeq 6000 DX, the first-ever FDA registered and CE-marked IVD high-throughput sequencer. We're excited to now provide DX offerings across the throughput spectrum. In mid-throughput, we saw record NextSeq 1K, 2K shipments which were up 40% year-over-year. This increase was driven by accelerated adoption of multiomics primarily in cancer research and cellular and molecular biology, both by new and existing customers. And as part of our ongoing innovation road map, our launch of X leap SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1K, 2K remains on track for 2024. Finally, low throughput shipments were up 13% year-over-year. These instruments continue to provide a great entry point to sequencing. This continued demand for our sequencing platforms across the throughput spectrum will contribute to a larger installed base and drive future consumables revenue. We're also receiving positive feedback from early access customers of Illumina complete long reads and complete long reads with enrichment and are expanding to additional customer sites. Customer appreciate Illumina's unique ability to deliver a high-quality, cost-effective and complete view of the genome on a single platform, enhancing utility across our installed base. Shifting to our market segments. Clinical sequencing consumable shipments were up 5% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in oncology testing and genetic disease testing. Sequencing run activity by our clinical customers remains. As expected though, lab expansion delays and consumables inventory deleveraging have persisted due to broader macro dynamics. Oncology testing consumables grew 9% year-over-year as our larger customers continue to shift towards high-throughput applications, our decentralized clinical testing customers ramped up business and new customers came online. Our market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, grew 17% year-over-year as large customers took advantage of the assays utility, reimbursement and proficiency. TSO 500 adoption continues to grow, with total accounts approaching $500 million. Also in oncology, GRAIL continued to make good progress in Q3, delivering clinical results and signing up a broad range of customers across the health care ecosystem, including health systems and life insurance providers. GRAIL announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Karim Health, the first digital health company, connecting employers and employees to centers of excellence through a value-based care platform. The partnership provides Galleri as part of Karim's oncology offering to self-insured employers. Also, John Hancock, the U.S. division of Manulife with over 1.5 million life insurance participants recently became the first life insurance carrier to offer Galleri. The GRAIL team expanded its clinical sales force in Q3 and has seen test orders increase. Evidence for Galleri's efficacy also continues to grow. In September at ESMO, GRAIL presented compelling final results from its PATHFINDER study. The study demonstrated that when added to standard of care screening, Galleri multi-cancer early detection testing more than doubled the number of cancers detected compared to standard screening alone. In fact, Galleri detected more cancers than all U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommended single cancer screenings combined. And Galleri's positive predictive value of about 40% is significantly higher than commonly used screening tests like the annual screen for colorectal cancer which has a PPV of 8.7%, are the biennial mammography screen with a PPV of 4.4%. Galleri is the only multi-cancer detection test available on the market. An analysis of the first 38,154 Galleri commercial test results in a real-world setting shows high concordance with the PATHFINDER study results. In addition, PATINA study participants experienced with the Galleri test has also been positive with 97.1% of participants reporting a high level of satisfaction with the test. In genetic disease testing, sequencing consumable shipments grew 11% year-over-year. National health system funding for rare diseases is increasing in multiple geographies, including EMEA and China and evidence generation continues to grow. For example, in September, Genetics in Medicine published a study from Karolinska Institute, indicating that genome sequencing is a sensitive first-line test for neurodevelopment disorders. We're also seeing customer excitement around the potential for NovaSeq X to create efficiencies for both whole genome and whole exome sequencing. Turning to our research and applied markets. Sequencing consumable shipments were down 8% year-over-year as customers continue to manage inventory and capital spend and due to expected headwinds from COVID surveillance and the completion of the UK Biobank project in Q3 2021. We continue to support our customers through these dynamics and at the same time, are making ongoing progress in facilitating genomic-based drug discovery. As this area continues to grow, we will partner with a range of pharmaceutical companies like our recent collaboration with AstraZeneca to help accelerate genomics and find promising drug targets based on OMIC insights. In our infectious disease and microbiology markets, we are broadening genomic opportunities across disease states. For example, we recently announced a partnership with General Screen to help countries impacted by tuberculosis to more effectively detect and combat multidrug resistant strains. TB claims more than 1.5 million lives each year and for the first time in a decade, deaths are on the rise after the pandemic. We hope that with this work, we can help vulnerable populations and make progress towards eliminating TB worldwide. Turning now towards the end of 2022 and entering 2023. We expect the macroeconomic challenges we have previously discussed to persist into 2023 and feel that it's prudent to adjust our near-term guidance accordingly. Joydeep will address our revised FY '22 guidance shortly. Despite the near-term challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory. Customers around the world continue to share their excitement for our latest innovations. We're staying focused on supporting them and advancing our innovation road map to accelerate the genome era. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep for more detail on the quarter and our year-end outlook.\nJoydeep Goswami: Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2022. I will be discussing results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to view the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's earnings release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.12 billion, up 1% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. net of the effects of hedging. As expected, our core business growth was impacted by anticipated headwinds from customer supply chain issues that delayed lab expansions as well as tighter customer inventory and capital as inflation and the negative impact of FX. These dynamics have persisted and, in some cases, accelerated through the third quarter leading to our guidance reduction for the full year 2022 which I will address later in my remarks. For the third quarter, GAAP net loss was $3.82 billion, or a net loss of $24.26 per diluted share which includes goodwill impairment of $3.91 billion related to the GRAIL segment, primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates, including a stand-alone risk premium on the fair value calculation of the GRAIL segment. Non-GAAP earnings were $54 million or $0.34 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $148 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 43.2% which increased from 25.8% last quarter and 13.2% in Q3 2021, primarily due to the increased impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $159 million. Moving to segment results. I will start by discussing the financial results of Core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion was approximately flat year-over-year or up 3% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $725 million was approximately flat year-over-year. As expected, growth driven by the increased installed base was muted by the year-over-year impact of customer inventory and cash management, headwinds from foreign exchange rates, the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank project in quarter 3 of 2021 and the anticipated decrease in COVID surveillance revenue. Sequencing activity on our connected instruments for clinical customers remains strong. While the pace of research sequencing activity was tempered by various macroeconomic challenges, Francis mentioned. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina declined 10% year-over-year to $162 million driven by lower NovaSeq shipments due to expected customer lab expansion delays and capital management as well as purchasing DLAs in advance of next year's availability of NovaSeq X. This decline was partially offset by record NextSeq 1K, 2K shipments which grew 40% year-over-year as we continue to see strong adoption by new to Illumina customers. During the third quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $28 million in total revenue comprised of $23 million in sequencing consumables and $5 million in instruments. This was in line with our expectations and down nearly 50% year-over-year, driven by lower testing samples and a decline in instrument shipments as COVID surveillance capacity was largely established in 2021. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $123 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base and an increase in core licensing revenue. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas was $592 million, up 2% year-over-year primarily driven by NovaSeq consumables growth due to demand from genetic testing, oncology testing and cancer research customers. As expected, growth in the region was largely offset by customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management as well as a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. EMEA revenue of $290 million represented a 7% decrease year-over-year or a 2% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. Strong growth in mid-throughput instrument shipments driven by clinical demand was more than offset by the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank program and a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. Greater channel revenue of $133 million represent a 9% increase year-over-year or a 14% increase on a constant currency basis. Record quarterly revenue in the region was driven by a growth in sequencing consumables for routine NGS-based research that resumed after the COVID restrictions that began in March this year were lifted as well as strong sales of NovaSeq 6000 primarily to clinical customers for oncology testing. We continue to expect base business growth to be impacted by headwinds from the 0 COVID-19 policy, exchange rates and slowing GDP growth in the region. Finally, APG revenue of $95 million grew 6% year-over-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in the region was driven by strong demand in emerging markets, notably in India, Indonesia and Thailand and continued strength in NIPT and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 68.9% decreased 240 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes and higher freight costs, partially offset by favorable product mix. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $514 million were up $36 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth and investments we are making in R&D to support the continued advancements of our innovation road map. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP Core Illumina operating expenses were approximately $25 million lower than we had originally planned. As a result of lower performance-based compensation expense given our lower revenue outlook as well as cost containment initiatives focused on prioritizing hiring and discretionary spend, including travel. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. Grail revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. Grail non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $149 million for the quarter and consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow used in operations was negative $52 million, a net outflow due to a onetime payment related to the litigation settlement with BGI and mentioned to you last quarter. DSO was 51 days compared to 50 days last quarter due to revenue linearity. Third quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $67 million and free cash flow was negative $119 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year, including approximately flat core Illumina revenue compared to 2021 and GRAIL revenue in the range of $55 million to $65 million. Our revised outlook for the full year reflects the more challenging expected macroeconomic headwinds we observed through October. For core Illumina, approximately 1/3 of the reduction in our 2022 guidance from our previous expectations is primarily driven by delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe and the impact of inflation on research customers in Europe. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is split approximately 70-30 across 2 higher-than-expected factors. One, delays in instruments and consumables purchases primarily due to the excitement around NovaSeq X; and two, negative FX impact and consumables inventory deleveraging. For the full year, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This continues to include intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million which are eliminated in consolidation. Within core Illumina sequencing revenue, we now expect instrument revenue to be down slightly year-over-year and consumables revenue slightly below our guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per system for 2022, primarily driven by recruitment challenges at some large research and PopGen customers. The remainder of our pull-through ranges are in line with the historical guidance ranges that we have previously provided. For full year 2022, we now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 9.5% to 10% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%, reflecting our lower revenue outlook. We expect a consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% which continues to assume that the R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be repealed in Q4. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.35 to $2.50 which includes a lower than previously expected non-GAAP operating loss dilution from GRAIL of approximately $600 million. Lastly, we continue to expect diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares for 2022. We expect the macroeconomic headwinds we are experiencing to persist into 2023. As we noted in our last earnings call, we are proactively and prudently managing operating expenses with a continued focus on sustainable long-term revenue growth. We are well positioned to seize opportunities to scale in key areas that align to customers' future needs and our innovation road map. At the same time, you'll see us gain additional scale and efficiencies from other areas. We will continue to adapt our investments and expenses to support our customers, drive further progress in the genomics industry and enable our long-term growth. I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Joydeep. As Joydeep shared, we will continue to identify opportunities to mitigate the near-term effects of the global economic environment. At the same time, we are prioritizing our innovation road map and remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory. As I shared earlier, we're hearing high praise for the innovations we announced at the Illumina Genomics Forum, from Illumina complete long reads to our most powerful and most sustainable sequencer yet the NovaSeq X Series. These innovations will continue to evolve the genomics industry and we look ahead with tremendous optimism over the long term. We will help our customers through the current challenges and seize the potential of the genome era together. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dan Brennan with Cowen.\nDan Brennan: I wanted to -- there's a lot to talk about but I guess I'll focus on the NovaSeq X and the 300 shipment guide, including the 50 in 1Q ahead of our model. Maybe Francis and Joydeep, could you speak about some color regarding customer, early customer activity? Where are the orders coming from in terms of large research customers like genome centers versus more smaller customers on the clinical side? And then secondarily, with 50 orders in hand and you mentioned 170 advanced order books, so you're north of 200 already, would you characterize the 300 shipments while very attractive as possibly conservative, given expected future order momentum that you would expect to get over the next 6 to 9 months?\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Thanks for the question, Dan. So let me work through those questions. First of all, you're right, we are very, very pleased with the very strong response we've gotten from customers around the NovaSeq X. Frankly, it's been stronger than we expected and we had high expectations going into the Illumina Genomics Forum. The customers are coming from a sort of broad swath of customer segments. We're seeing more of a mix from clinical in addition to the usual genome centers that you'd expect to be some of the early adopters. And we're seeing a mix both from U.S. customers as well as customers from outside the U.S. So sort of a nice broad brush of early adopter customers and maybe even a little bit more on the clinical side than we saw when we first launched the NovaSeq 6000 a few years ago. As you pointed, the initial orders we've got that you pointed out, 50 orders already in hand, that means that our Q1 shipments are already sold out. So we're really entering the year in a really strong position for NovaSeq X shipments. And move a very healthy pipeline of 170 customers that are down the pipeline already. So when you look at the shipment number for the year, the number that I called out, the 300 units, it's clear that the shipment number is going to be more constrained by supply availability next year than it is for demand. Because as you point out, we're entering the year with a very strong demand book. And the way we think about it is that over the first couple of quarters of the year, you can expect us to have more demand than we can ship just as we continue to ramp up the manufacturing capability for NovaSeq X and we'll start to service that backlog as we get into the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Francis, I had a 2-parter, if you will, just on the prior Nova X. The constraints here at the to mention. Can you give us some color on how this cycle compares to the prior NovaSeq X. I mean, we're like a month into a product announcement north of 200 orders. This looks like it could be a really big year for you guys from an order perspective next year. So maybe compare versus the prior cycle and the implied Q4 guidance here on for. I think revenues are minus 13%. And if I think about first Q1 of next year being in the negative territory, maybe next year shaping out to be maybe a mid-single to high top line. So any color on how to think about fiscal '22 would be helpful.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. So as I said to the last question, you're right in the sense that the customer reaction to NovaSeq X has certainly even stronger than we anticipated. And we modeled the reaction based on our previous launches which have been really strong. But if we look at the number of orders we have already, the 50 orders we have the 170 in the advanced pipeline. If I were to compare it to where we were at a similar time with previous launches, I'd say we are better off than we've been with some of the other previous launches. So certainly in a very strong position going into next year. Again, the next year, NovaSeq shipments number is going to be supply constrained. And we ramped up an entirely new manufacturing line because we've redone every component of this instrument, right? So entirely new chemistry, new FFM, new flow cells, new manufacturing process for the flow cells. And so we're really happy with the way that scale-up is happening. So if I compare the number I gave you for the Q1 shipments that would be ahead. So the 40 to 50 shipments we expect in Q1, that would be more shipments than we did in the first quarter when we launched the NovaSeq 6000, so slightly ahead of where we were before. And then the 300 units that we're expecting to ship would be ahead of where we were with the first year of NovaSeq x 6000 as well. So that's how it compares with previous launches. Maybe I'll turn it over now to Joydeep.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So maybe just 1 thing on the -- what's changed for NovaSeq, right? We are seeing, as Francis mentioned earlier, strong demand, early strong demand from clinical customers as well, right? And this we attribute to the trend of continued strong clinical research coming in which is now shifting to NovaSeq X for some of these studies. So I think that's a positive trend. I think your next question was about the relationship with -- for Q4 and then into 2023. So a few things on Q4, as we pointed out, right, towards the end of Q3 and early into October, we have seen a deepening of some of the macroeconomic conditions we talked about, including inflation and FX. And that caused us to be prudent for the reasons I mentioned earlier to take a more conservative approach into our call for Q4 but also we now see these conditions persist into 2023. So we're taking a look at some of those conditions. And as we know some of the factors that have changed to the negative. FX has definitely worsened and accelerated for us and we expect will be continued headwind into 2023. I talked about the macroeconomic conditions. We've already mentioned that COVID surveillance is likely to decline further into 2023. So this kind of is some of the factors that moderate what we had expected earlier for -- and continue to see in terms of the interest in NovaSeq X and of course, some of the other technologies that we mentioned during IGF, including the Illumina complete long reads. Overall, Dan, I think we feel at this point and we haven't gone to guidance and budgeting yet. But at this point, I feel like we are probably expect revenue growth in 2023 to be closer to the 10% range rather than where we had guided before.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Francis, can you just touch on the lab delay issue a little bit. It sounded like last quarter, the delays were a 2Q to 3Q phenomenon more than they weren't. You were in line this quarter. So the fourth quarter assumption is obviously getting adjusted here which just seems a little bit more extended than we would think. So can you just sort of talk to what's going on there? And then when your expectations call for some of these labs actually getting going and being where they need to be?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, sure. So when we talked about the results last time on the call, we talked about the fact that we've seen some delays that we're looking to get ramped up later this year and some that were going into next year. And what we found is in both of those cases, ended up being a little later than those customers had expected. And so we're seeing a push out from what was expected to come this quarter being pushed out into next year. And then even the dates for next year opening have been pushed out somewhat too. So the pandemic-related effects around supply chain are definitely persisting and are impacting those lab delays.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: So first one, I just want to clarify that 10% growth that you mentioned for 2023, that's on the entire top line. And then I just wanted to also get a little bit around the 10 and the 25 B sort of flow cells. 10b is launching earlier, 25 is going to be later in next year. It appears to us that the 10 billion read flow cell could be most meaningful in your portfolio, just given that it can turn around samples in 24 hours and to still give the NovaSeq capacity that is delivered through NovaSeq 6000 today on. So maybe just walk us through how do you see the ramp for that? And what does that all mean in terms of sort of pull-through into 20 -- into 2023.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Puneet. So let me talk to both. I'll start by saying that the answer we gave around the 10% wasn't intended guide for next year. It was intended to just talk about how we were thinking about some of the factors that are at play Q4 going into Q1 and we'll give a specific guide as we get into next year once we've done the bottoms of budget. In terms of the flow cells, I think you're absolutely right. That comparing it to the existing instrument they have because it's very similar in terms of footprint, in terms of output and we'll probably take on some of the same workloads. And so customers will feel we'll see a sense of familiarity and move to the X with that flow cell. And so you'll see customers that start with that. And then the $25 billion we close call is really intended to unlock the next generation of studies, the very large programs that customers have been talking to us about and have been waiting for the price points of the X that are fundamentally enabling to those studies. And so you can think about it as there will be the first flow cell that existing NovaSeq 6000 customers will view is very familiar to them in terms of output and the workloads that it does and we'll start using as sort of their entry point into the X series. And then it's the bigger flow cell that unlocks the next wave of elasticity in demand.\nJoydeep Goswami: Dan, maybe Puneet, to add, right? We expect the transition, obviously, to move forward on the consumables side much faster with research customers and clinical customers because they're invalidated workflows will switch a little bit later into the cycle.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Julia Qin with JPMorgan.\nJulia Qin: I remember, you noted at the Analyst Day that enabled by NovaSeq, it could be a meaningful catalyst event for some of the PopSeq initiatives around the world. But at the same time, I think you noted in 4Q, there will be some research project delays, including recruitment challenges for some of the POPC program. So I guess, in light of that, how should we think about how meaningful the POPSEQ programs will be in terms of our revenue contribution next year?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me address both parts of your question. One is around the effects we're seeing in Q4 around some of these past programs. And then two, about the X being enabling to future proxy programs and how important that will be. In Q4, what we said is that there are some -- a small number of very specific ongoing population sequencing programs that are experiencing some recruiting delays associated with those programs. It's a small handful and they're experiencing delays in these existing projects. We have no doubt that these projects will continue on and complete and they will get the recruiting they did. But a little bit slower in Q4 than they were expecting to go. Now if we think about what X enables that the next generation, if you like. So what customers have been talking to us about for a while and then in earnest over the last 5 weeks since we announced the X is the very large projects that they want to do. Where the number of samples are measured sometimes in the millions. And they're talking about very large exome projects, very large genome projects that, frankly, we're just not economically viable until we brought out the X. And one of the things we talked about on Investor Day that's relevant here is that our team, in some cases, plays an important role in making those projects. So not only a technology enabler role by putting out a scalable instrument at the price points that make these projects viable -- but in many cases, we are also helpful in bringing together the parties, whether it's pharma companies or biobanks or national health systems. We are responsible for helping bring to convene those parties together to get those projects off the ground. And I can tell you that over the last few weeks, Susan and our commercial team have been very busy in high demand around health systems around the world that are interested in leveraging the power of the X to put together programs to create, for example, cohorts that are that's more diverse than we have today or much bigger than they are today. And so I think the X will be a very substantial needle mover on that front.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Sorry on a continuation of the question I asked last quarter on consumable ordering behavior. I know there's usually an expiration date on some of these consumables I know there was a little bit -- you mentioned, Joe, I think some of that continued dynamics around burn down lasting into the fourth quarter. Maybe it's a little bit -- maybe it's right on your expectation but it does look like compared to my model that, that is 1 of the corporates that continues to happen. So how are we not interpreting this is a slowdown for sequencing or the market in general in context of a lot of your customers have budgets? They have NIH budgets flowing in. They have -- they have tests that they have to get ordered and what I'm getting into is, if it's not this, why still at 10% in 2023, given the fact that I would think that there would then be catch up from all these consumables missed in Q3 and Q4? And sorry if that was a really one question.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. Let me try to stand again. As Francis said, we are still in the process of budget. So the 10% wasn't meant as a guide. It's more of a -- from the macroeconomic conditions we see. So I think that maybe 2 parts, David. first, in terms of your question about are we seeing inventory deleveraging has it accelerated or decelerated, right? So we were actually quite on point with what we had expected in terms of inventory deleveraging with maybe a very small part of the additional guidance we provided on Q4, actually coming from incremental inventory deleveraging. So that's part one, right? Now in terms of whether things have slowed up slowed down rather from what we had communicated at the end of Q2. We did see 2 specific things that we mentioned which had been slower than we had expected, right, in terms of demand or activity. So 1 of them were the few key customers a handful of customers that Francis mentioned, that had these large research and PopGen projects that had some issues with recruit, right? So those are things that we expect will cut will recover over time. This is not a budget issue. This is not mostly an inflation related -- not an inflation-related issue. The other thing that we did see was inflation and FX related, specifically related to research customers in Europe, right? So there, we did see a slowdown happening. We expect that some of this will continue into next year as some of these headwinds persist. But again, it's not a structural change. It's a temporary change that are caused by very specific macroeconomic factors.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. I want to try to squeeze in a couple but they're all on the same topic. One, for the GRAIL write-down, the $3.91 billion. Could you talk through the rationale, the underlying reason we've taken out this quarter? Does that have any impact on divestment discussions or sort of the puts and takes on what goes into that decision, especially if you sort of think back to a year ago I think the deal goes right around a year ago for $8 billion? And then also, did you clarify like Grail was down sequentially, $12 million in the second quarter to $10 million in the third but the midpoint of the fiscal year since. So was it just some lumpy orders coming through? Just what's going on there?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So let me take the first part of your question. So the reassessment of GRAIL's book value was really more of an accounting requirement triggered by some of the regulatory decisions coming out of Europe. Again, the primary driver of the valuation change was the higher discount used really as a result of the current capital and equity market conditions, right? The underlying the performance of GRAIL in terms of how it's progressing on its clinical results and signing up customers really has not changed and in fact, has improved a little bit over the last few quarters. Impairment, again, is an accounting change, it has no impact on our pursuant of various options on the GRAIL front and those are continuing as we had described earlier in our -- on our Investor Day. I'll turn it over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, in terms of the GRAIL number. So the way the quarter played out, the first month of the quarter of July was slow in terms of test ordering. And then the pace really picked up in September, partially driven by the ramp-up in the sales force that GRAIL has brought on board and we talked about that on the Q2 call. And so that's paid off in the last month of last quarter and in the first few weeks of this quarter. And so that's what's driving the shape of the curve. In terms of the expectations for the year, they're off to a strong start for Q4 and the midpoint of guide remains the same. And then the other factor that's playing out in Q4 is the revenue they're getting from their pharma partnerships associated with their MRD development.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.\nKyle Mikson: Just a quick mortgage part question for me. On NovaSeq X, I was wondering what your expectations are for trade-ins and bundles in the near term, just given the X is basically like the equivalent of multiple 6000. So maybe you could talk about that in the context of the '23 shipment numbers that you provided today maybe kind of spoke to earlier? And then on kind of separately Francis, just wondering if you can share your thoughts on the complete offering in the long-read space, just given the updates from PacBio others recently?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So let me take the first part first which was around our expectation of trade-ins. So our customers, based on their experience with us know that we have always help keep customers whole when we launch a new platform. And so as we've always done when we've launched a new platform, we have trade-in programs for customers that have recently purchased to 6,000. And we actually have programmed even now that if you want to buy a 6,000 now to get going, you can trade it in, so you can buy now and trade it in once we launch the next year. And certainly, there have been customers that appreciated that very much and have taken us up on that. And we expect some more to take us up on that through this quarter and going into next year. So that's a standard part of our launching a new product. In terms of our complete long reads, we've seen a really enthusiastic response from our customers around being able to use their existing installed base across the throughput sizes. So whether you're a MiSeq, all the way to Nova 6000 or the X to do both long-read and short-read workloads and to do that in a way that allows them to take advantage of low sample inputs lower than they can perhaps on other platforms. And so we expect that to be fundamentally enabling to that space. And if you especially if you combine the existing platforms you have with the complete long read it enrichment, you end up with the ability to do long reads much, much more cost effectively than you could do on other platforms without compromising accuracy in any way. So, you still get the gold standard of accuracy and you can do it much more cost effectively. So that's really exciting. What it does is it opens up that last bit of the genome, the last few percent is genome that historically was hard to read with short read technology.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Francis, a 2-parter for you here. So I want to talk about the metered ramp down for the NovaSeq 6000 consumables, you alluded to at the Analyst Day because of a higher proportion of clinical users. But then today, you guys out a higher clinical mix for the X. So I'm just trying to juxtapose those 2 dynamics as we think about the NovaSeq 6000 consumables tail off over the next couple of years here? And my second question is really around some of the PopGen recruitment delays that you called out over here. If I remember right, in the last product cycle, essentially, ops had to be removed from the guide because it became so unpredictable in terms of timing. Can you just call out sort of what you see is different this time around that drives your confidence that at least as far as POPSEQ goes, you will continue to get that sort of elasticity of demand?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, great question. So let me take the first 1 first. So you're absolutely right in the sense that if you are running production clinical workloads today, you are going to continue to run them on the NovaSeq 6000 for a while. And then it will be a -- there'll be a metered transition that will be measured in quarters and years before you move that entire production workload on to the. So that continues to be what we believe that continues to be the feedback we're getting from our customers. What's really exciting, though, is that clinical customers are talking to us about and their purchases are really about new workloads. And so it's areas that they want to expand into that they're saying instead of starting on the 6,000, they'd like to start that development on the with an idea then, of course, to ramp it up into production on the X. And so that has been more substantial than we expected. So that means that there are a bunch of our large clinical customers that are expanding into new clinical areas. And so it's an exciting development for the field. It's also an exciting development for as well. In terms of POPSEQ, the -- what we have talked about is that when we are bringing on new POPSEQ deals, new big POPSEQ deals, we'll tend to binary them out of our of our guide, if they are big and we're still trying to figure out when they land. And as you know, that's a learning we had in terms of how these deals develop. But once they're in production, they are in the guys right? And so there, the variability isn't quite as big as whether a big deal will come on or not. It may ramp up or down in a quarter and then certainly, we'll call it out for you if that happens or if we see that starting to happen which is what we're doing for Q4. So that's more -- less variability rather than entirely new deal coming on which again, we'll tend to be more conservative in terms of building that into our guide.\nJoydeep Goswami: And Francis, I'd just add, I think it is a great question about the clinical side, right? I think we are seeing some of these newer tests that Francis called out going more towards NovaSeq because these are also the higher intensity tests which have much higher throughput requirements which is consistent with what we mentioned regarding elasticity and continuing to go up with the introduction of new technologies.\nOperator: And moving on to Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse.\nDan Leonard: I just want to make sure I understand the change in the 2022 guide for core Illumina. It seems like you attributed half of the guidance reduction to delays associated with the X, if I'm doing the math right, 70% of the 2/3, you knew you were launching the X. So what evolved differently from your expectations?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, you're absolutely right. We knew we were launching the X and we sort of modeled the customer interest based on the previous launches we've done. Frankly, we've been really surprised in a positive way around how much interest there has been from our customers in getting to the X. And again, as I said, we fully expected our clinical customers to be a little bit slower in terms of coming on board for the X. And what we're finding is that they're not the reasons we talked about that while they're keeping production workflows on the 6,000 and they are excited about using the X for their new applications which, as Joydeep said, tend to be more sequencing-intensive applications. And so that has been an upside surprise in terms of the enthusiasm for the X but has a knock-on effect and the people are saying, look, I'm going to hold on the 6,000 in Q4 and wait for the X as it starts to ship in Q1.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Francis, maybe 1 just on the customer base, more on the kind of clinical diagnostics side. I know in the past quarter, you kind of called out there being a little more conservative with cash, particularly kind of speaking to the inventory question. Are you still seeing that piece? What are the conversations like and kind of the outlook for that market?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So we're definitely seeing that continue to play out. We think 2 things glad. One, activity levels in terms of runs on the instruments that they have continue to be robust and generally in line with the commentary we shared in Q2. At the same time, we are seeing concern around their cash position and our desire to want to manage their inventory levels more conservatively perhaps than they have historically. That's also enabled by the fact that they've seen that our supply has been very consistent and robust and stable even through the pandemic. And we have confidence in saying, look, we can run at a lower inventory level for a while and still maintain the integrity of their operations capability. And so we're definitely seeing that dynamic continue to play.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Luke Sergott with Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: Can you give us a sense of the margin profile of what X LEAP is going to come through? I think it's important to think about as you ramp on the NovaSeq X next year. And as that continues to come up and you're having the higher pull-through, we need to kind of figure out where the operating margin is going to come through?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, sure, Luke. The expectation and the design point is to maintain similar margins with the instruments that use the new X chemistry as the instruments that they're replacing. So if you look at the X, for example, you should think about it over time as it scales to have a similar margin profile to the NovaSeq 6000, both in the generally on the instrument side and certainly on the consumable side. And so that's the design criteria we use. The idea is to invest in technology that fundamentally lowers the cost to make the product and then pass on those savings our customers. So maintain the same margins and pass on the savings to our customers associated with the innovations that we're bringing like X, like the new optics, like the new flow cells and so on.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to talk a little bit about the guide here for the fourth quarter. So I think for the year, the new consumables guide is flat by my math and you can check me on this a lot of earnings tonight. I think that implies down 16% in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk us through what's going on there maybe between price and volume? And it just seems like given you're talking about it's kind of concentrate in one part of the customer base, it just feels like a big move.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So overall, Jack, the -- for the full year, you're right, it's sequencing consumables tends to be -- is tending to be flat. Pricing actually is not impacted, right? This is mostly volume track the price piece pretty carefully and it is in line with what we have seen in previous quarters. I think the reasons for the volume reduction is what we have stated earlier, right? So there is a component of it. By the way, if you look at the revenues, as a component of FX that has come through. And then in terms of the volumes, there is -- there are two components, right? So primarily on the -- there's an inventory deleveraging part which we had, some of which most of it which called out earlier and then there's some additional piece. And then the two specific pieces around large research customers and the recruitment delays and some slow down inflation-related and FX related that we have seen in Europe. So those continue to be the largest sources of a slowdown. And then one of the things that Francis had mentioned as well is on the NovaSeq X side, right? The increased interest in NovaSeq halted some of the consumables purchases on NovaSeq X as well, right? So that is a component there.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update with you at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our third quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2022. I will be discussing results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to view the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's earnings release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.12 billion, up 1% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. net of the effects of hedging. As expected, our core business growth was impacted by anticipated headwinds from customer supply chain issues that delayed lab expansions as well as tighter customer inventory and capital as inflation and the negative impact of FX. These dynamics have persisted and, in some cases, accelerated through the third quarter leading to our guidance reduction for the full year 2022 which I will address later in my remarks. For the third quarter, GAAP net loss was $3.82 billion, or a net loss of $24.26 per diluted share which includes goodwill impairment of $3.91 billion related to the GRAIL segment, primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates, including a stand-alone risk premium on the fair value calculation of the GRAIL segment. Non-GAAP earnings were $54 million or $0.34 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $148 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 43.2% which increased from 25.8% last quarter and 13.2% in Q3 2021, primarily due to the increased impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $159 million. Moving to segment results. I will start by discussing the financial results of Core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion was approximately flat year-over-year or up 3% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $725 million was approximately flat year-over-year. As expected, growth driven by the increased installed base was muted by the year-over-year impact of customer inventory and cash management, headwinds from foreign exchange rates, the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank project in quarter 3 of 2021 and the anticipated decrease in COVID surveillance revenue. Sequencing activity on our connected instruments for clinical customers remains strong. While the pace of research sequencing activity was tempered by various macroeconomic challenges, Francis mentioned. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina declined 10% year-over-year to $162 million driven by lower NovaSeq shipments due to expected customer lab expansion delays and capital management as well as purchasing DLAs in advance of next year's availability of NovaSeq X. This decline was partially offset by record NextSeq 1K, 2K shipments which grew 40% year-over-year as we continue to see strong adoption by new to Illumina customers. During the third quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $28 million in total revenue comprised of $23 million in sequencing consumables and $5 million in instruments. This was in line with our expectations and down nearly 50% year-over-year, driven by lower testing samples and a decline in instrument shipments as COVID surveillance capacity was largely established in 2021. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $123 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base and an increase in core licensing revenue. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas was $592 million, up 2% year-over-year primarily driven by NovaSeq consumables growth due to demand from genetic testing, oncology testing and cancer research customers. As expected, growth in the region was largely offset by customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management as well as a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. EMEA revenue of $290 million represented a 7% decrease year-over-year or a 2% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. Strong growth in mid-throughput instrument shipments driven by clinical demand was more than offset by the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank program and a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. Greater channel revenue of $133 million represent a 9% increase year-over-year or a 14% increase on a constant currency basis. Record quarterly revenue in the region was driven by a growth in sequencing consumables for routine NGS-based research that resumed after the COVID restrictions that began in March this year were lifted as well as strong sales of NovaSeq 6000 primarily to clinical customers for oncology testing. We continue to expect base business growth to be impacted by headwinds from the 0 COVID-19 policy, exchange rates and slowing GDP growth in the region. Finally, APG revenue of $95 million grew 6% year-over-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in the region was driven by strong demand in emerging markets, notably in India, Indonesia and Thailand and continued strength in NIPT and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 68.9% decreased 240 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes and higher freight costs, partially offset by favorable product mix. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $514 million were up $36 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth and investments we are making in R&D to support the continued advancements of our innovation road map. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP Core Illumina operating expenses were approximately $25 million lower than we had originally planned. As a result of lower performance-based compensation expense given our lower revenue outlook as well as cost containment initiatives focused on prioritizing hiring and discretionary spend, including travel. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. Grail revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. Grail non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $149 million for the quarter and consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow used in operations was negative $52 million, a net outflow due to a onetime payment related to the litigation settlement with BGI and mentioned to you last quarter. DSO was 51 days compared to 50 days last quarter due to revenue linearity. Third quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $67 million and free cash flow was negative $119 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year, including approximately flat core Illumina revenue compared to 2021 and GRAIL revenue in the range of $55 million to $65 million. Our revised outlook for the full year reflects the more challenging expected macroeconomic headwinds we observed through October. For core Illumina, approximately 1/3 of the reduction in our 2022 guidance from our previous expectations is primarily driven by delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe and the impact of inflation on research customers in Europe. The remaining 2/3 of this reduction is split approximately 70-30 across 2 higher-than-expected factors. One, delays in instruments and consumables purchases primarily due to the excitement around NovaSeq X; and two, negative FX impact and consumables inventory deleveraging. For the full year, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This continues to include intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million which are eliminated in consolidation. Within core Illumina sequencing revenue, we now expect instrument revenue to be down slightly year-over-year and consumables revenue slightly below our guidance range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per system for 2022, primarily driven by recruitment challenges at some large research and PopGen customers. The remainder of our pull-through ranges are in line with the historical guidance ranges that we have previously provided. For full year 2022, we now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 9.5% to 10% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23%, reflecting our lower revenue outlook. We expect a consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% which continues to assume that the R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be repealed in Q4. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.35 to $2.50 which includes a lower than previously expected non-GAAP operating loss dilution from GRAIL of approximately $600 million. Lastly, we continue to expect diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares for 2022. We expect the macroeconomic headwinds we are experiencing to persist into 2023. As we noted in our last earnings call, we are proactively and prudently managing operating expenses with a continued focus on sustainable long-term revenue growth. We are well positioned to seize opportunities to scale in key areas that align to customers' future needs and our innovation road map. At the same time, you'll see us gain additional scale and efficiencies from other areas. We will continue to adapt our investments and expenses to support our customers, drive further progress in the genomics industry and enable our long-term growth. I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. So maybe just 1 thing on the -- what's changed for NovaSeq, right? We are seeing, as Francis mentioned earlier, strong demand, early strong demand from clinical customers as well, right? And this we attribute to the trend of continued strong clinical research coming in which is now shifting to NovaSeq X for some of these studies. So I think that's a positive trend. I think your next question was about the relationship with -- for Q4 and then into 2023. So a few things on Q4, as we pointed out, right, towards the end of Q3 and early into October, we have seen a deepening of some of the macroeconomic conditions we talked about, including inflation and FX. And that caused us to be prudent for the reasons I mentioned earlier to take a more conservative approach into our call for Q4 but also we now see these conditions persist into 2023. So we're taking a look at some of those conditions. And as we know some of the factors that have changed to the negative. FX has definitely worsened and accelerated for us and we expect will be continued headwind into 2023. I talked about the macroeconomic conditions. We've already mentioned that COVID surveillance is likely to decline further into 2023. So this kind of is some of the factors that moderate what we had expected earlier for -- and continue to see in terms of the interest in NovaSeq X and of course, some of the other technologies that we mentioned during IGF, including the Illumina complete long reads. Overall, Dan, I think we feel at this point and we haven't gone to guidance and budgeting yet. But at this point, I feel like we are probably expect revenue growth in 2023 to be closer to the 10% range rather than where we had guided before. Dan, maybe Puneet, to add, right? We expect the transition, obviously, to move forward on the consumables side much faster with research customers and clinical customers because they're invalidated workflows will switch a little bit later into the cycle. Yes. Let me try to stand again. As Francis said, we are still in the process of budget. So the 10% wasn't meant as a guide. It's more of a -- from the macroeconomic conditions we see. So I think that maybe 2 parts, David. first, in terms of your question about are we seeing inventory deleveraging has it accelerated or decelerated, right? So we were actually quite on point with what we had expected in terms of inventory deleveraging with maybe a very small part of the additional guidance we provided on Q4, actually coming from incremental inventory deleveraging. So that's part one, right? Now in terms of whether things have slowed up slowed down rather from what we had communicated at the end of Q2. We did see 2 specific things that we mentioned which had been slower than we had expected, right, in terms of demand or activity. So 1 of them were the few key customers a handful of customers that Francis mentioned, that had these large research and PopGen projects that had some issues with recruit, right? So those are things that we expect will cut will recover over time. This is not a budget issue. This is not mostly an inflation related -- not an inflation-related issue. The other thing that we did see was inflation and FX related, specifically related to research customers in Europe, right? So there, we did see a slowdown happening. We expect that some of this will continue into next year as some of these headwinds persist. But again, it's not a structural change. It's a temporary change that are caused by very specific macroeconomic factors. Yes. So let me take the first part of your question. So the reassessment of GRAIL's book value was really more of an accounting requirement triggered by some of the regulatory decisions coming out of Europe. Again, the primary driver of the valuation change was the higher discount used really as a result of the current capital and equity market conditions, right? The underlying the performance of GRAIL in terms of how it's progressing on its clinical results and signing up customers really has not changed and in fact, has improved a little bit over the last few quarters. Impairment, again, is an accounting change, it has no impact on our pursuant of various options on the GRAIL front and those are continuing as we had described earlier in our -- on our Investor Day. I'll turn it over to Francis. Yes. So let me take the first part first which was around our expectation of trade-ins. So our customers, based on their experience with us know that we have always help keep customers whole when we launch a new platform. And so as we've always done when we've launched a new platform, we have trade-in programs for customers that have recently purchased to 6,000. And we actually have programmed even now that if you want to buy a 6,000 now to get going, you can trade it in, so you can buy now and trade it in once we launch the next year. And certainly, there have been customers that appreciated that very much and have taken us up on that. And we expect some more to take us up on that through this quarter and going into next year. So that's a standard part of our launching a new product. In terms of our complete long reads, we've seen a really enthusiastic response from our customers around being able to use their existing installed base across the throughput sizes. So whether you're a MiSeq, all the way to Nova 6000 or the X to do both long-read and short-read workloads and to do that in a way that allows them to take advantage of low sample inputs lower than they can perhaps on other platforms. And so we expect that to be fundamentally enabling to that space. And if you especially if you combine the existing platforms you have with the complete long read it enrichment, you end up with the ability to do long reads much, much more cost effectively than you could do on other platforms without compromising accuracy in any way. So, you still get the gold standard of accuracy and you can do it much more cost effectively. So that's really exciting. What it does is it opens up that last bit of the genome, the last few percent is genome that historically was hard to read with short read technology. And Francis, I'd just add, I think it is a great question about the clinical side, right? I think we are seeing some of these newer tests that Francis called out going more towards NovaSeq because these are also the higher intensity tests which have much higher throughput requirements which is consistent with what we mentioned regarding elasticity and continuing to go up with the introduction of new technologies. Yes. So overall, Jack, the -- for the full year, you're right, it's sequencing consumables tends to be -- is tending to be flat. Pricing actually is not impacted, right? This is mostly volume track the price piece pretty carefully and it is in line with what we have seen in previous quarters. I think the reasons for the volume reduction is what we have stated earlier, right? So there is a component of it. By the way, if you look at the revenues, as a component of FX that has come through. And then in terms of the volumes, there is -- there are two components, right? So primarily on the -- there's an inventory deleveraging part which we had, some of which most of it which called out earlier and then there's some additional piece. And then the two specific pieces around large research customers and the recruitment delays and some slow down inflation-related and FX related that we have seen in Europe. So those continue to be the largest sources of a slowdown. And then one of the things that Francis had mentioned as well is on the NovaSeq X side, right? The increased interest in NovaSeq halted some of the consumables purchases on NovaSeq X as well, right? So that is a component there."

            "content": "Thank you, Sally. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered revenue of $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year and 3% on a constant currency basis and in line with our expectations despite deepening macroeconomic challenges. Looking at our Q3 performance across platforms, in high throughput, we shipped 65 NovaSeq 6000 in Q3, down from the prior year, in line with our expectations. We had a fantastic customer response to the NovaSeq X Series launch at the Illumina Genomics Forum, where we reached more than 12,000 viewers in our innovation road map sessions. Labs are excited by NovaSeq X's industry-leading power, efficiency and cost effectiveness and they love in their words, it's unexpected and revolutionary sustainability breakthroughs including ambient shipping and a 90% reduction in packaging, weight and waste. Customer traction for NovaSeq X is exceeding our expectations. We already have an advanced pipeline of more than 170 instruments in addition to 50 orders that we have already received. Our manufacturing scaling is proceeding well and we expect to ship 40 to 50 NovaSeq X units in Q1 2023 and over 300 units in the year. At the Illumina Genomics Forum, we also launched the NovaSeq 6000 DX, the first-ever FDA registered and CE-marked IVD high-throughput sequencer. We're excited to now provide DX offerings across the throughput spectrum. In mid-throughput, we saw record NextSeq 1K, 2K shipments which were up 40% year-over-year. This increase was driven by accelerated adoption of multiomics primarily in cancer research and cellular and molecular biology, both by new and existing customers. And as part of our ongoing innovation road map, our launch of X leap SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1K, 2K remains on track for 2024. Finally, low throughput shipments were up 13% year-over-year. These instruments continue to provide a great entry point to sequencing. This continued demand for our sequencing platforms across the throughput spectrum will contribute to a larger installed base and drive future consumables revenue. We're also receiving positive feedback from early access customers of Illumina complete long reads and complete long reads with enrichment and are expanding to additional customer sites. Customer appreciate Illumina's unique ability to deliver a high-quality, cost-effective and complete view of the genome on a single platform, enhancing utility across our installed base. Shifting to our market segments. Clinical sequencing consumable shipments were up 5% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in oncology testing and genetic disease testing. Sequencing run activity by our clinical customers remains. As expected though, lab expansion delays and consumables inventory deleveraging have persisted due to broader macro dynamics. Oncology testing consumables grew 9% year-over-year as our larger customers continue to shift towards high-throughput applications, our decentralized clinical testing customers ramped up business and new customers came online. Our market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, grew 17% year-over-year as large customers took advantage of the assays utility, reimbursement and proficiency. TSO 500 adoption continues to grow, with total accounts approaching $500 million. Also in oncology, GRAIL continued to make good progress in Q3, delivering clinical results and signing up a broad range of customers across the health care ecosystem, including health systems and life insurance providers. GRAIL announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Karim Health, the first digital health company, connecting employers and employees to centers of excellence through a value-based care platform. The partnership provides Galleri as part of Karim's oncology offering to self-insured employers. Also, John Hancock, the U.S. division of Manulife with over 1.5 million life insurance participants recently became the first life insurance carrier to offer Galleri. The GRAIL team expanded its clinical sales force in Q3 and has seen test orders increase. Evidence for Galleri's efficacy also continues to grow. In September at ESMO, GRAIL presented compelling final results from its PATHFINDER study. The study demonstrated that when added to standard of care screening, Galleri multi-cancer early detection testing more than doubled the number of cancers detected compared to standard screening alone. In fact, Galleri detected more cancers than all U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommended single cancer screenings combined. And Galleri's positive predictive value of about 40% is significantly higher than commonly used screening tests like the annual screen for colorectal cancer which has a PPV of 8.7%, are the biennial mammography screen with a PPV of 4.4%. Galleri is the only multi-cancer detection test available on the market. An analysis of the first 38,154 Galleri commercial test results in a real-world setting shows high concordance with the PATHFINDER study results. In addition, PATINA study participants experienced with the Galleri test has also been positive with 97.1% of participants reporting a high level of satisfaction with the test. In genetic disease testing, sequencing consumable shipments grew 11% year-over-year. National health system funding for rare diseases is increasing in multiple geographies, including EMEA and China and evidence generation continues to grow. For example, in September, Genetics in Medicine published a study from Karolinska Institute, indicating that genome sequencing is a sensitive first-line test for neurodevelopment disorders. We're also seeing customer excitement around the potential for NovaSeq X to create efficiencies for both whole genome and whole exome sequencing. Turning to our research and applied markets. Sequencing consumable shipments were down 8% year-over-year as customers continue to manage inventory and capital spend and due to expected headwinds from COVID surveillance and the completion of the UK Biobank project in Q3 2021. We continue to support our customers through these dynamics and at the same time, are making ongoing progress in facilitating genomic-based drug discovery. As this area continues to grow, we will partner with a range of pharmaceutical companies like our recent collaboration with AstraZeneca to help accelerate genomics and find promising drug targets based on OMIC insights. In our infectious disease and microbiology markets, we are broadening genomic opportunities across disease states. For example, we recently announced a partnership with General Screen to help countries impacted by tuberculosis to more effectively detect and combat multidrug resistant strains. TB claims more than 1.5 million lives each year and for the first time in a decade, deaths are on the rise after the pandemic. We hope that with this work, we can help vulnerable populations and make progress towards eliminating TB worldwide. Turning now towards the end of 2022 and entering 2023. We expect the macroeconomic challenges we have previously discussed to persist into 2023 and feel that it's prudent to adjust our near-term guidance accordingly. Joydeep will address our revised FY '22 guidance shortly. Despite the near-term challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory. Customers around the world continue to share their excitement for our latest innovations. We're staying focused on supporting them and advancing our innovation road map to accelerate the genome era. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep for more detail on the quarter and our year-end outlook. Thanks, Joydeep. As Joydeep shared, we will continue to identify opportunities to mitigate the near-term effects of the global economic environment. At the same time, we are prioritizing our innovation road map and remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory. As I shared earlier, we're hearing high praise for the innovations we announced at the Illumina Genomics Forum, from Illumina complete long reads to our most powerful and most sustainable sequencer yet the NovaSeq X Series. These innovations will continue to evolve the genomics industry and we look ahead with tremendous optimism over the long term. We will help our customers through the current challenges and seize the potential of the genome era together. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Great. Thanks for the question, Dan. So let me work through those questions. First of all, you're right, we are very, very pleased with the very strong response we've gotten from customers around the NovaSeq X. Frankly, it's been stronger than we expected and we had high expectations going into the Illumina Genomics Forum. The customers are coming from a sort of broad swath of customer segments. We're seeing more of a mix from clinical in addition to the usual genome centers that you'd expect to be some of the early adopters. And we're seeing a mix both from U.S. customers as well as customers from outside the U.S. So sort of a nice broad brush of early adopter customers and maybe even a little bit more on the clinical side than we saw when we first launched the NovaSeq 6000 a few years ago. As you pointed, the initial orders we've got that you pointed out, 50 orders already in hand, that means that our Q1 shipments are already sold out. So we're really entering the year in a really strong position for NovaSeq X shipments. And move a very healthy pipeline of 170 customers that are down the pipeline already. So when you look at the shipment number for the year, the number that I called out, the 300 units, it's clear that the shipment number is going to be more constrained by supply availability next year than it is for demand. Because as you point out, we're entering the year with a very strong demand book. And the way we think about it is that over the first couple of quarters of the year, you can expect us to have more demand than we can ship just as we continue to ramp up the manufacturing capability for NovaSeq X and we'll start to service that backlog as we get into the second half of the year. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. So as I said to the last question, you're right in the sense that the customer reaction to NovaSeq X has certainly even stronger than we anticipated. And we modeled the reaction based on our previous launches which have been really strong. But if we look at the number of orders we have already, the 50 orders we have the 170 in the advanced pipeline. If I were to compare it to where we were at a similar time with previous launches, I'd say we are better off than we've been with some of the other previous launches. So certainly in a very strong position going into next year. Again, the next year, NovaSeq shipments number is going to be supply constrained. And we ramped up an entirely new manufacturing line because we've redone every component of this instrument, right? So entirely new chemistry, new FFM, new flow cells, new manufacturing process for the flow cells. And so we're really happy with the way that scale-up is happening. So if I compare the number I gave you for the Q1 shipments that would be ahead. So the 40 to 50 shipments we expect in Q1, that would be more shipments than we did in the first quarter when we launched the NovaSeq 6000, so slightly ahead of where we were before. And then the 300 units that we're expecting to ship would be ahead of where we were with the first year of NovaSeq x 6000 as well. So that's how it compares with previous launches. Maybe I'll turn it over now to Joydeep. Yes, sure. So when we talked about the results last time on the call, we talked about the fact that we've seen some delays that we're looking to get ramped up later this year and some that were going into next year. And what we found is in both of those cases, ended up being a little later than those customers had expected. And so we're seeing a push out from what was expected to come this quarter being pushed out into next year. And then even the dates for next year opening have been pushed out somewhat too. So the pandemic-related effects around supply chain are definitely persisting and are impacting those lab delays. Thank you, Puneet. So let me talk to both. I'll start by saying that the answer we gave around the 10% wasn't intended guide for next year. It was intended to just talk about how we were thinking about some of the factors that are at play Q4 going into Q1 and we'll give a specific guide as we get into next year once we've done the bottoms of budget. In terms of the flow cells, I think you're absolutely right. That comparing it to the existing instrument they have because it's very similar in terms of footprint, in terms of output and we'll probably take on some of the same workloads. And so customers will feel we'll see a sense of familiarity and move to the X with that flow cell. And so you'll see customers that start with that. And then the $25 billion we close call is really intended to unlock the next generation of studies, the very large programs that customers have been talking to us about and have been waiting for the price points of the X that are fundamentally enabling to those studies. And so you can think about it as there will be the first flow cell that existing NovaSeq 6000 customers will view is very familiar to them in terms of output and the workloads that it does and we'll start using as sort of their entry point into the X series. And then it's the bigger flow cell that unlocks the next wave of elasticity in demand. Yes. So let me address both parts of your question. One is around the effects we're seeing in Q4 around some of these past programs. And then two, about the X being enabling to future proxy programs and how important that will be. In Q4, what we said is that there are some -- a small number of very specific ongoing population sequencing programs that are experiencing some recruiting delays associated with those programs. It's a small handful and they're experiencing delays in these existing projects. We have no doubt that these projects will continue on and complete and they will get the recruiting they did. But a little bit slower in Q4 than they were expecting to go. Now if we think about what X enables that the next generation, if you like. So what customers have been talking to us about for a while and then in earnest over the last 5 weeks since we announced the X is the very large projects that they want to do. Where the number of samples are measured sometimes in the millions. And they're talking about very large exome projects, very large genome projects that, frankly, we're just not economically viable until we brought out the X. And one of the things we talked about on Investor Day that's relevant here is that our team, in some cases, plays an important role in making those projects. So not only a technology enabler role by putting out a scalable instrument at the price points that make these projects viable -- but in many cases, we are also helpful in bringing together the parties, whether it's pharma companies or biobanks or national health systems. We are responsible for helping bring to convene those parties together to get those projects off the ground. And I can tell you that over the last few weeks, Susan and our commercial team have been very busy in high demand around health systems around the world that are interested in leveraging the power of the X to put together programs to create, for example, cohorts that are that's more diverse than we have today or much bigger than they are today. And so I think the X will be a very substantial needle mover on that front. Yes, in terms of the GRAIL number. So the way the quarter played out, the first month of the quarter of July was slow in terms of test ordering. And then the pace really picked up in September, partially driven by the ramp-up in the sales force that GRAIL has brought on board and we talked about that on the Q2 call. And so that's paid off in the last month of last quarter and in the first few weeks of this quarter. And so that's what's driving the shape of the curve. In terms of the expectations for the year, they're off to a strong start for Q4 and the midpoint of guide remains the same. And then the other factor that's playing out in Q4 is the revenue they're getting from their pharma partnerships associated with their MRD development. Yes, great question. So let me take the first 1 first. So you're absolutely right in the sense that if you are running production clinical workloads today, you are going to continue to run them on the NovaSeq 6000 for a while. And then it will be a -- there'll be a metered transition that will be measured in quarters and years before you move that entire production workload on to the. So that continues to be what we believe that continues to be the feedback we're getting from our customers. What's really exciting, though, is that clinical customers are talking to us about and their purchases are really about new workloads. And so it's areas that they want to expand into that they're saying instead of starting on the 6,000, they'd like to start that development on the with an idea then, of course, to ramp it up into production on the X. And so that has been more substantial than we expected. So that means that there are a bunch of our large clinical customers that are expanding into new clinical areas. And so it's an exciting development for the field. It's also an exciting development for as well. In terms of POPSEQ, the -- what we have talked about is that when we are bringing on new POPSEQ deals, new big POPSEQ deals, we'll tend to binary them out of our of our guide, if they are big and we're still trying to figure out when they land. And as you know, that's a learning we had in terms of how these deals develop. But once they're in production, they are in the guys right? And so there, the variability isn't quite as big as whether a big deal will come on or not. It may ramp up or down in a quarter and then certainly, we'll call it out for you if that happens or if we see that starting to happen which is what we're doing for Q4. So that's more -- less variability rather than entirely new deal coming on which again, we'll tend to be more conservative in terms of building that into our guide. Yes, you're absolutely right. We knew we were launching the X and we sort of modeled the customer interest based on the previous launches we've done. Frankly, we've been really surprised in a positive way around how much interest there has been from our customers in getting to the X. And again, as I said, we fully expected our clinical customers to be a little bit slower in terms of coming on board for the X. And what we're finding is that they're not the reasons we talked about that while they're keeping production workflows on the 6,000 and they are excited about using the X for their new applications which, as Joydeep said, tend to be more sequencing-intensive applications. And so that has been an upside surprise in terms of the enthusiasm for the X but has a knock-on effect and the people are saying, look, I'm going to hold on the 6,000 in Q4 and wait for the X as it starts to ship in Q1. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So we're definitely seeing that continue to play out. We think 2 things glad. One, activity levels in terms of runs on the instruments that they have continue to be robust and generally in line with the commentary we shared in Q2. At the same time, we are seeing concern around their cash position and our desire to want to manage their inventory levels more conservatively perhaps than they have historically. That's also enabled by the fact that they've seen that our supply has been very consistent and robust and stable even through the pandemic. And we have confidence in saying, look, we can run at a lower inventory level for a while and still maintain the integrity of their operations capability. And so we're definitely seeing that dynamic continue to play. Yes, sure, Luke. The expectation and the design point is to maintain similar margins with the instruments that use the new X chemistry as the instruments that they're replacing. So if you look at the X, for example, you should think about it over time as it scales to have a similar margin profile to the NovaSeq 6000, both in the generally on the instrument side and certainly on the consumable side. And so that's the design criteria we use. The idea is to invest in technology that fundamentally lowers the cost to make the product and then pass on those savings our customers. So maintain the same margins and pass on the savings to our customers associated with the innovations that we're bringing like X, like the new optics, like the new flow cells and so on."

Illumina delivered revenues of $1.16 billion in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis. While sequencing activity across our markets was robust in the second quarter, with sequencing runs on our connected high and mid-throughput platforms growing more than 15% year-over-year and clinical growing even faster, our second quarter results were impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we expect to play out over the next couple of quarters. Specifically, some customers experienced supply chain pressures that delayed their lab expansions and others manage inventory and capital more conservatively. We also saw adverse effects of foreign exchange and anticipated COVID-related shutdowns in China. The robust sequencing activity levels, underlying growth of our target markets and our conversations with customers across the globe indicate these dynamics are temporary. During the quarter, we also made terrific progress on our innovation road map, and are poised to soon deliver the next generation of breakthrough technologies that will fuel the next era of genomics. Turning now to performance across our platforms. In high throughput, NovaSeq shipments in Q2 grew 23% year-over-year, our highest second quarter ever. Consistent with prior quarters, clinical customers, primarily in oncology testing, drove half of our NovaSeq shipments. In mid-throughput, NextSeq 1000, 2000 orders were up 20% year-over-year. Despite some shipments shifting from Q2 to Q3 due to supply delays, Q2 NextSeq 1000, 2000 shipments increased slightly year-over-year. Low throughput shipments were relatively flat year-over-year, even with the comparison to last year's COVID surveillance-driven volume. Turning to our markets. We continue to gain traction in clinical, with sequencing consumable shipments for the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year, and all of our clinical markets contributing to the increase. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen continued growth in our oncology markets. In Q2, oncology consumables grew almost 20% year-over-year. An area of note is our market-leading TruSight Oncology Assay. Shipments of TSO grew 45% year-over-year, and we now have delivered distributed comprehensive genomic profiling tests to every major market in the world. We have worked closely with large evidence programs to facilitate clinical utility and drive market access. And we have more than 10 pharma partners developing CDx claims with us. Most recently, we expanded our portfolio by co-developing a new TSO 500 HRD test with Merck, that leverages Illumina's work with Myriad Genetics. We also co-developed a pan-cancer companion diagnostic for TSO comprehensive EU with Bayer. Also in oncology, June marks the one-year anniversary of GRAIL's launch of Galleri. In that time, Galleri delivered the fastest ever first year revenue ramp of a cancer screening test. GRAIL continues to drive progress in clinical evidence generation and commercial use of their multi-cancer early detection test, Galleri. The number of U.S. health systems, partnering with GRAIL to offer Galleri continues to grow, most recently with the addition of Mercy, one of the 25 largest U.S. health systems and Ochsner Health, the largest Gulf South Health system. Also, GRAIL recently partnered with AstraZeneca to develop companion diagnostic tests that will identify patients with high-risk early-stage disease. AstraZeneca will use GRAIL technology to recruit patients with early-stage cancer for AstraZeneca's clinical studies, making cancer medicines available where there is greater potential to transform outcomes. More broadly, the trials currently underway for Galleri continue to progress. The NHS-Galleri trial in the UK, the largest multi-cancer early detection study, has enrolled 140,000 volunteers in just over 10 months, an unprecedented speed, especially for a trial of this size. The pending successful completion of the trial, the NHS plans to roll out Galleri to an additional 1 million people starting in 2024. This collaboration supports the NHS long-term plan to transform cancer care with three and four cancers diagnosed at an early stage by 2028. Additionally, GRAIL has completed a final analysis of its PATHFINDER study, with data to be presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress September 9 through 13. GRAIL has made substantial progress building a network of partners that will support ongoing adoption of Galleri. The commercial progress is proceeding at a more measured pace as health systems ramp-up. For these reasons, GRAIL has revised its revenue guidance for the full year 2022 to a range of $50 million to $70 million. Turning to infectious disease and microbiology, the genomic surveillance infrastructure built on Illumina instruments during the pandemic in more than 100 countries is now being used for other diseases like monkeypox. This network is enabling a quicker genetic assessment of this new disease as momentum continues to build for a robust global pathogen infrastructure. We're expanding our surveillance portfolio accordingly. In June, we provided select customers access to our novel viral surveillance panel, based on workflows implemented for COVID-19. The panel provides targeted sequencing for the 66 most critical viruses of global public health concern, including monkeypox and polio, and will be commercially available later this year. Our research and applied markets were relatively flat year-over-year, with growth in the Americas and APJ, offset by declines in EMEA and China. In the quarter, we announced our partnership with Precision Health Research Singapore or PRECISE, to sequence whole genomes of 100,000 Singaporean participants. Together, we will develop Southeast Asia's most comprehensive population study and gather deep insights into Asian genomic diversity and key genetic, social, environmental and other factors associated with disease. Before I update you on further advances in our innovation road map, I'll turn the call over to Joydeep.\nJoydeep Goswami: Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our second quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2022. I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.16 billion, up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Revenue was impacted by the macroeconomic factors that Francis referenced. As you know, we had anticipated the headwinds from the China shutdowns, the negative impact of FX and slowing COVID surveillance. Each of these were slightly worse than we expected, and collectively, they drove one-quarter of the variance between our expectations and actual results. The remainder of this variance was driven by the lab expansion delays encountered by a few of our large customers as a result of global supply chain constraints, as well as customer inventory and capital management. Nonetheless, overall sequencing activity on our connected instruments was strong in the second quarter, with sequencing runs in our high and mid-throughput instruments growing more than 15% year-over-year. We believe this is a useful reference that shows the general activity trend across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. For the second quarter, GAAP net loss was $535 million or a loss of $3.40 per diluted share, which included $609 million in legal contingencies recorded in Q2 due to the potential fine that the European Commission may impose related to our GRAIL acquisition and settlement of our litigation with BGI. Non-GAAP earnings were $91 million or $0.57 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, which increased 790 basis points year-over-year and 800 basis points from Q1 2022, primarily due to the increased impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to segment results, I will start by discussing the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue of $1.16 billion grew 3% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables grew 6% year-over-year to $744 million, driven by almost 20% growth in oncology testing. Core consumables growth more than offset headwinds from lockdowns in China, the completion of the UK Biobank program in quarter three of 2021, reductions in COVID surveillance, and negative FX impacts. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 1% year-over-year to $119 million, driven by 23% growth in NovaSeq shipments, offset by a 14% decrease in the mid-throughput shipments year-over-year. The decrease in mid-throughput shipments was primarily due to headwinds from COVID surveillance and COVID lockdowns in China with NextSeq 1000, 2000 growth more than offset by a decrease in NextSeq 550. NextSeq 1000, 2000 instruments continued to grow year-over-year and the growth would have been stronger had it not been for temporary supply constraints that delayed shipments into the third quarter. NextSeq 1000, 2000 orders were up 20% year-over-year, with continuing strong adoption of our newest platform. During the second quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $25 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $2 million in incremental instruments revenue, representing a decline of 55% year-over-year. This decline was driven by lower than expected testing samples and the expected decline in instrument shipments as COVID surveillance capacity was largely established in 2021. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $125 million was down 2% year-over-year driven by $20 million of one-time revenue recognized in 2021 from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement, partially offset by increased instrument service contracts and contributions from oncology co-development partnerships. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $633 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to NovaSeq strength with continued demand from oncology testing customers, driving instrument placements, and consumables grow. Growth in the region was nonetheless lower than expected primarily due to customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management we have mentioned during the call. EMEA revenue of $308 million represented a 4% decrease year-over-year, but a 1% increase on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. Sequencing growth driven by clinical and large-scale research projects was more than offset by the UK Biobank program in 2021 and a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. Cumulatively, these significant headwinds and FX negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth by 20 percentage points. Greater China revenue of $118 million represented an 11% decrease year-over-year and a 10% decrease on a constant currency basis. This was slightly more negative than the approximately $35 million headwind to guidance we provided last quarter. As expected, the region continued to be impacted by prolonged COVID-19 restrictions and shutdowns that began in March this year. Finally, APJ revenue of $97 million grew 14% year-over-year or 20% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in the region was primarily due to increased NovaSeq shipments, which doubled year-over-year, driven by large-scale research project demand as well as strength in NIPT and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. For Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 69.8% decreased 200 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, margin impact from one-time revenue from a patent litigation settlement in 2021 and increased freight costs attributable to broader global supply chain pressures. These factors were partially offset by a more favorable product mix, as well as a number of productivity initiatives we continue to execute. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $519 million were up $48 million year-over-year, due primarily to headcount growth and investments we're making in R&D to support the continued advancements of our innovation road map. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP core Illumina operating expenses were lower than we originally planned, as a result of lower performance-based compensation expense, given our lower revenue outlook and cost containment initiatives focused on select hires and discretionary spend, including travel. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $12 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $156 million for the quarter and consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. These expenses were lower than expected, as GRAIL managed its project spend in light of its lower quarterly outlook. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $125 million. DSO was 50 days compared to 46 days last quarter due to revenue linearity. Second quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $71 million and free cash flow was $54 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We have revised our outlook for the full year to represent the macroeconomic factors we observed through early August, and we assume will continue for the rest of the year. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to grow in the range of 4% to 5%, including core Illumina revenue growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%, and GRAIL revenue of $50 million to $70 million. For the full year, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 4.5%. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. Within core Illumina sequencing revenue, we now expect instrument growth of 1.5% and consumables growth of 5%, which reflects NovaSeq pull-through in the range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million for a system for 2022. We continue to expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000, 2000 in the range of $130,000 to $180,000 per system, and for the NextSeq 550 in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 per system. For MiSeq, we continue to expect pull-through in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 per system. And for MiniSeq, we continue to expect pull-through in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 per system. We now expect revenue from COVID surveillance in the range of $110 million to $130 million. While we anticipated a decline in COVID surveillance in 2022, the deceleration has occurred at a more rapid pace than we previously forecasted. As we navigate the macroeconomic factors we have mentioned, we're implementing multiple strategies, including prioritizing key innovation investments and critical hires, while pausing investments that can be made at later times. We've retained all critical investments in our innovation road map, including NovaSeqDx, Chemistry X, our Infinity long-read technology and our TSO portfolio. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 11.5% to 12% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 24.5% to 25%. We expect the consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14%, which continues to assume that the R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be repealed or deferred in Q4. And we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.75 to $2.90, which includes dilution from GRAIL non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $610 million, in line with previous expectations. Lastly, we continue to expect diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares for 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect consolidated revenue to be flat to 1% higher year-over-year from the third quarter of 2021. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 5%. We expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 20%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which continues to reflect the negative impact from the R&D capitalization requirements, we expect will be repealed or deferred in the fourth quarter of this year. And lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares. I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Joydeep. Turning to our innovation road map, we have significant opportunities to reimagine the power and potential of genomics. Development and registration activities for NovaSeqDx, the first-ever high throughput clinical sequencer are progressing as planned and on track for a Q4 launch. We continue to get good feedback from initial customers on our Infinity Long Read technology with many saying it has the potential to replace on-market long reads for a broad range of applications, including human rare diseases. Infinity is on track to be available later this year for early access customers. In Multiomics, our partnership with SomaLogic to accelerate NGS into proteomics is progressing, and we expect to deliver our ultra-high throughput ultra-high plexity assay in 2024. Turning now to Chemistry X. Our next-generation breakthrough SBS chemistry, we've made fantastic progress over the last quarter. We're now producing flow cells using our new manufacturing process based on 300-millimeter wafers. We successfully tested Chemistry X on the new flow cells and the results exceed our expectations for quality, cost and speed. We're excited to showcase these breakthroughs and reveal how they come to life at the Illumina Genomics Forum. And we look forward to hosting you at our Investor Day on October 3rd, where we will discuss these technologies and our long-term growth strategies. If you haven't already registered, please be sure to do so soon. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi. Good afternoon. So Francis, I'm a bit perplexed on the lab expansion comments, are channel checks and discussions at AGBT in June didn't suggest that this was happening. So is this more of an issue with your clinical customers not expanding? And how do you know it wasn't the impact of potential them evaluating competing products? And just exactly how much consumable inventory is there still in the channel? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Hi, Derik. So in terms of the lab expansion, what we saw happen in Q2 was a few of our customers that had plans to launch new labs or expanded labs experienced some delays on their own because of their own supply chain issues, equipment that they were expecting to get for those expanded labs didn't come in as they expected. And so we saw a few lab expansion plans delayed, some into Q2, into Q3 and then one into Q4 of next year. As you can imagine, we are very close to our customers. So we know the specifics of those lab expansions. And to be clear, those lab expansions are delayed, but still progressing. And so that's what's driving the number we talked about, both in Q2 and for the rest of the year. In terms of inventory, what's playing out is some of our customers that are looking to manage their capital more closely are holding less inventory on their site. They have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our supply chain. And so they're looking to trim back the inventory levels that they hold on their own site. And so from our perspective, we expect that to play out. It started to play out in Q2. It will play out a little bit in three and four as well. But in the end, their demand activity levels are going to match what we are seeing from the data that we get from monitoring their instruments. And there, the activity and therefore, demand continues to be very robust. As we said in Q2, the activity levels that we're monitoring on the high and mid-throughput instruments reflected a growth rate in runs that are greater than 15%. And so as we work through these transitory impacts, we fully expect both demand and therefore, orders to more closely match the activity levels that we're seeing.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up to Derik's question and then a related one. So just the magnitude of the second half decline, Francis. So the guidance -- the new updated guidance for core Illumina growth suggests kind of flat growth in the back half of the year versus kind of the high teens that you were initially guiding to. So just the magnitude from a few customers. Maybe you can just speak a little bit more to just -- any more color on that front, just kind of is there a healthy amount of conservatism that you're baking in here, or just kind of how do you -- how do we reconcile the magnitude of the cut with a few customers kind of holding back? And then kind of as a related question, to Derik's point, Mike, are you seeing any delay, whether it be ahead of Chemistry X launching, so customers might be pausing or any impact from some of the competitive noise that's out there, which I think would be more palatable, I think, so the cut if it was like a pause on as we're waiting to evaluate new products. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks for that question, Dan. And maybe I'll start with the second half, and then I'll turn it over to Joydeep to sort of size the magnitude of the factors that we talked about. From what we are seeing and what we are hearing from our customers, the challenges that our customers are addressing are around their lab expansion delays, as I said, related to dealing with their own supply chain for the expansion of their labs. And again, tighter management of their inventory levels. And that really were some of the big drivers of the change in addition to a little bit of foreign exchange and so on. And so what they're telling us is this isn't really related to Chemistry X or any competitive issues. In fact, they're excited to hear about Chemistry X, and they're looking forward to learning more about it at the Illumina Genomics Forum. But really, what's driving the change are the factors that we talked about. And maybe I'll turn it over to you, Joydeep, to shed some more color on the size of that.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. Thanks, Francis. So I think, first of all, our -- Dan, you asked about the forecast for the second half conservative, we believe, based on trends we've seen that it's actually a balanced forecast, right? There's always upsides and downsides. There are -- the factors that we saw in the second quarter, we believe will continue into the next -- through the rest of this year. To size them up, approximately 25% of the decline from our forecast, it really is coming from factors such as FX, the faster-than-expected acceleration on the COVID side and some of the declines we have seen in China, which are really more GDP-related effects on the research side of our business in China. The other 75% or so are related to the factors that Francis referred to, which are really around lab expansion delays due to broader supply chain constraints that are impacting the construction of labs at our customers and them bringing up new assays and instruments. And then, the impacts we're seeing from the macroeconomic headwinds on our customers that are causing a temporary reduction in inventory levels and also some capital push-outs.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Francis, maybe just back on the consumable side. You've talked a lot about the fact that the outlook for sequencing there is good, because that work essentially has to be done in order to support patient assessment. So what's slamming the brakes on purchasing so abruptly? Is it more development on the commercial side related to things like liquid biopsy work, or are you actually seeing lower spending patient-facing institutions, clinical oncology institutions, et cetera? And then just a follow-up, why no preannouncement when Sam left, only three weeks left in the quarter. So it seems like a miss was well on its way at that point. Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let me take both parts of the question, Dan. So let me start by addressing the consumables and demand point. You're right. We end up -- because we serve clinical customers, a lot of our customers continue to see robust demand. They're targeting, for example, cancer patients that need their tissue biopsy to then sequenced or ctDNA tests. And that is reflected in the activity levels that we saw in Q2. That even as customers were looking to manage their inventories more tightly, they continue to run their machines hard, right? So we said, overall, if you look at the run activity on the mid and high throughput instruments that we monitor, across our customer base, so we monitor, the runs grew 15% year-over-year. But in the clinical markets, that was actually higher, for exactly the reasons you talked about that our customers in the clinical markets, especially in areas like oncology therapy selection testing, which represents for us the largest segment that we serve, that they continue to see robust demand, and that was reflected in their activity levels. Now, as we said, our customers are looking to manage their cash more conservatively, so they trim back the amount of inventory that they're holding on their sites. I think they can do that as a one-time sort of rebalancing down. But ultimately, their ordering levels will match the activity levels that they have on their instruments. And so that's why we expect this impact to play out a little bit in Q2, a little bit in the coming quarters, but then order rates will match, we believe, the actual activity that we're seeing on their machines. Let me talk a little bit about the Sam point. So when Sam left, as we said, he left because of personal reasons, and he needed to be on the East Coast. And that's what we said when he left, obviously. From our perspective, our quarters tend to be more back-end loaded. And so, the impact that I talked about became more clear at the end of the quarter. And so hence, there was no color commentary at the time Sam left.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Yes. I\u2019m sorry, I'm going to go back to kind of the quantification of the guidance here. You back out the guidance, it looks like $400 million. FX got worse. I don't know if you want to quantify that. COVID surveillance, what that number is? I know GRAIL was $20 million and then lab expansion. I mean, is there anything in addition to those factors that maybe you can point out? And then I want to go back to like the instrument or I mean the backlog here. You guys felt really good about the backlog exiting the quarter. It seems like maybe that didn't -- those orders didn't go as expected or fill out as expected, or what's going on with that? Thank you.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So Dave, thanks for the question. Let me reiterate what I said earlier, right? So two broad buckets, about 25% or so of that -- of the miss was really around things which included FX, the faster than expected decline in COVID surveillance. China and some of the effects, the macroeconomic effects that we are seeing in the second half of the year, which are not related directly to the lockdown with the slower than expected GDP growth that they're having, right? And then the other bucket, the 75% really was the two factors, the lab expansion delays, which, again, we expect to see coming back in 2023. So these are comments that we have heard directly from our customers. And then the second piece was around the slower than expected accumulation or restocking of inventory and some capital pushouts from a broader set of customers. Again, as Francis mentioned, we expect these to be transitory. I think in terms of the backlog, I will say that the backlog that we're exiting Q2 with a strong backlog of $1.1 billion. This is in line with what we have seen in the previous six quarters. Again, backlog does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter as you would expect. But this, again, is very much in line with what we have seen in the past six quarters, which, as you will remember, were pretty strong.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julia Qin with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJulia Qin: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two specific follow-ups on the guidance. On NovaSeq, I noticed you took down the pull-through guidance to $1.1 million to $1.2 million. Given you noted there's pretty strong volume utilization. Are there pricing factors at play for your updated guidance? And then on GRAIL, you take it down by $20 million. So could you -- given that NHS seems to be progressing well, could you explain what the factors are played there? Thank you.\nJoydeep Goswami: So, thanks, Julia, for the question. So let me take the NovaSeq pull-through question first. So no, first, let me address -- I mean, this is not about pricing pressures. What we -- as you know, the pull-through is really an output of a number of factors, right? So, shipments in the quarter divided by a number of instruments that we expect to have activated at a certain point in time. Now both these played out this quarter in a way that are transitory and we had not expected. So first, although the -- as Francis mentioned, right, the number of runs in our instruments were strong due to the inventory deleveraging, the actual number of shipments, which is the numerator of that calculation was slightly low. Also because we had customers that bought a large number of NovaSeqs in previous quarters and because of some of the lab expansion delays that you heard about, some of these instruments didn't come online, right? So the denominator, because of the way we calculate pull-through, was inflated. So we do see this pull-through number being lower in this quarter as a result of those two factors. However, as we look forward, given the strong number of runs growth that our instruments are seeing across a broad range of our high throughput customers, and given the strong market factors that are very intensive in sequencing, like MRD, like oncology testing, and things like spatial and proteomics, we do expect that in the long run, this number will continue to grow. And then I think you had a second question, which was \u2013 oh, the GRAIL factor. So, a couple of things, right? As Francis mentioned, GRAIL has already proven itself to be a very well adopted test. It is the fastest revenue growth first year after launch of any screening test on the market ever. So while GRAIL numbers have been somewhat lower than expected, from the earlier guidance, it is nonetheless a very strong test, and we see a really strong adoption in multiple hospital systems across the country. So we believe that the test ordering from these systems that have already committed to GRAIL will pick up. But for the time being, I think we remain very optimistic about the quality of the test and it's potential.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening. Just a quick follow-up to kick things off there on the pricing, but from a more forward-looking perspective here. Francis, you mentioned some customers thinking harder about CapEx. Some of them are even undergoing restructuring as we've seen this quarter. I was curious as to how you're thinking about this weighing on growth in 2023 and perhaps more importantly, in the near term. How, if at all, does this change how you're thinking about pricing for Chemistry X, backward compatibility options for Chemistry X and so on?\nFrancis deSouza: Sure, Tejas. So in terms of helping our customers as they're working through the macro challenges, obviously, we remain close to them. The reality is we are core to their business and their revenue generation, and we are a very important supplier to these customers. And so while we can help them in the sense that, because of the strength and the resilience of our supply chain, they're more confident in maintaining less inventory on site that obviously helps them with cash outlays. The reality is they need to continue to service the demand they're getting, because that's what drives their revenues and their growth and their long-term success. And so we are not seeing a pullback in terms of activity levels from those customers, again, because we are core to their revenue generation and their success. And we'll stay \u2013 we're staying close to them. We're also very staying close to the lab expansion plans and making sure we were on top of when they expect to get equipment for the labs as they come online. In terms of pricing from our perspective, our thesis continues to believe that, there is a huge opportunity to expand the genomics market by continuing to drive the price for high-quality sequencing, highly accurate sequencing down. That thesis continues to hold certainly in the research markets, but also in terms of opening up new clinical markets. We're seeing promising work, for example, happening in areas like cardiovascular disease and neurological disease. And those will require both very large experiments from a research perspective, but also maybe different price points from a clinical perspective. And so we continue to march forward with the idea that part of our mission is to make genomics more accessible by driving costs down. In terms of Chemistry X and the instruments, the way we are thinking about it is there certainly -- we're certainly capable from a technology perspective of making Chemistry X available on instruments that are already on the market. So, that is a lever available to us. And as we look at the market, we want to be sensitive to the fact that if customers have bought an instrument that we launched fairly recently, that they may not have gone through their depreciation cycle. And so we'll think more about making Chemistry X available on those kinds of platforms. But if it's been an instrument that's been on the market for a while, and they've gone through a depreciation cycle, then there is an opportunity for us to help that market upgrade and not just take advantages of the innovations in Chemistry X, but take advantage of the innovations across all the other technology components, whether it's optics, for example, of data pads, and really deliver transformative new instruments. And that's how we're thinking about it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi Francis. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is really -- could you talk a little bit about, at a high level, maybe about who these customers are? Just trying to understand in terms of are these customers more COVID customers or oncology customers or genome center customers and their lab expansion plans because I think that's where the challenge is because when we look at the life science tools companies, the peer group that you have, some of those companies have delivered very strong growth. They had supply chain challenges in the first quarter. In fact, supply chain challenges were even more pronounced. And these labs have taken delivery of a lot of these instruments. That's why peer group companies have delivered strongly. So, just wondering what is different here with Illumina instruments or what's unique about these customers? And then on GRAIL, I mean, you're pointing out as the fastest adopted test, but at the same time, you're lowering your guide. So, just trying to understand, is there anything -- any unique dynamic with certain customers there? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So, let's take both. In terms of the labs, and I think you're asking about the labs that are delaying their expansion plans. Who are they? And you're saying, look, some of the other life science tools companies haven't seen that. So, I'll describe them a little bit for you. First of all, it's a few customers. Second, they're obviously genomics-focused customers. They run genomics labs. And so you may not see that in the general life sciences tools market, but you'll certainly see that in the sequencing market. They tend to be customers that are growing. These are the ones that have expansion plans. So, they are successful customers. They're experiencing robust growth. And in fact, they're serving markets like oncology, for example, where they see significant increased demand coming and are expecting to -- and are building significant labs. And so these are large customers, they are growing customers and they are customers that are facing significantly increased demand and are looking to expand their labs. Now, their genomics labs and the primary -- they're pretty much Illumina customers. And so obviously, we are the ones that ride that cycle with them. And that's why you'd see it with us. And that's why you'll see it as those labs come online, that's why you'll see the benefit of crude to Illumina. So, that's the characteristics of the customers we're talking about. In terms of GRAIL, it really has been just quite remarkable to see the fantastic growth they've had in their first year. If you look at their first 12 months of June and in this June, they just lapsed their first 12 months. They are the fastest revenue growth of any cancer screening test in history. Now that's quite remarkable, right? They're also doing a fantastic job in terms of signing up health systems and employers.  And I'll give you another example of just how fast things are moving. So, in the last quarter, they fully recruited the 140,000-person trial that they're running for the NHS. Now typically, a trial like that would take years to fully enroll. And the NHS working with GRAIL was able to do that in 10.5 months. That gives you some sense of just the acceptance, the hunger in the market, the demand in the market for just such a breakthrough test, right?  The fact that you can identify 50 cancers across all stages and people are starting to get a sense of the results of they're making it into the market. Now what we're looking at. Now even with that toward growth base is, we're looking at the rest of the year, and we're looking at the ramp-up that's happening in some of the \u2013 in some of the health systems that have signed up and some of the employers. The GRAIL team has tuned back some of their estimates for the rest of the year. That doesn't take away, again, this is the fastest-growing cancer screening test we've ever seen in history.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord. Please go ahead. \nKyle Mikson: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just a few on the guidance. So I was just curious about components of instrument revenue for \u201922, 1.5% year-over-year. Maybe Joydeep, can you talk about expectations for placements versus orders versus pricing, maybe pricing is locked in or not locked in at this point? Just given the backlog commentary, it was a very strong kind of like entering the year and recently, just how is that trending recently and going forward? And kind of relatedly, the year-over-year decline in mid-throughput shipments in 2Q. I mean I hear you on China and the other factors, but any chance that's partially due to the platform evaluation process as these new vendors into the market or at least make some noise because obviously, the large clinical labs already test driving these products, so it's just worth asking? Thanks.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. Thanks, Kyle. So let me start with the 2Q piece on the mid throughput, right? So as I mentioned right there, the orders for med throughput really were very strong, right? So we saw continued interest in strong orders for NextSeq 1000, 2000. This is our latest platform on that, pickup considerably and while there was a temporary supply chain issue at our end, which prevented us from delivering these orders in 2Q. They have subsequently been delivered already in this quarter. So we are very optimistic, and we see very, very strong demand and interest in our mid-throughput platform, both on our research and our clinical customers. On the full year, so a couple of things, right? So you start with NovaSeq first, right? So we've had a strong first half of the year. Our orders for the first part \u2013 first half of the year were up 30% year-over-year. And as we mentioned, right, 23% growth in the second quarter.  Now this is for a platform that has -- it's now six years from launch, right? So we see extremely strong unprecedented demand even on the back of a very strong 2021 and we're excited about that. Remember also that these instruments have -- most of these instruments have now been deployed. We expect now that the pull-through on consumables on these instruments will come and will continue to accelerate in subsequent quarters and years. So, we feel very good about our portfolio, both in the high throughput and the mid-throughput segment.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. \nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Francis, maybe one for you just in terms of kind of the operational spend that you guys are doing. You obviously kind of talked about the op margin pull down in the back half. Can you talk about how you're balancing some of the growth investments with also being mindful of kind of insulating the margins, protecting the bottom line.  Obviously, you have Chemistry X and Infinity coming up. I would assume you'd want to invest in kind of the launches there. So maybe just talk about, again, kind of that balance of investing for growth and at the same time, kind of realizing with things slowing, you protect the bottom-line a bit and where you're pulling back and where you're pushing forward? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Sure, Patrick. So obviously, with the revised revenue outlook for the year, we are taking a look at our spend and exactly as you said, doing that balance. On the one hand, we're looking for areas where we can contain costs. That means pulling back on discretionary items, for example like travel and other discretionary spend. And we're also prioritizing the hiring that we're doing.  And so, there are some hires that we will put off because we don't think it's essential to do right now. So, the team is absolutely doing that book. Having said that and we're also protecting our innovation roadmap, as well as essential hires in other parts of the company as we scale the business.  We have very ambitious product plans, as you know and we're going to continue to protect that roadmap because that's what drives the success of our customers and our long-term success and that's what creates the long-term shareholder value in the company. So that's the balance we're doing. We're protecting the innovation roadmaps. We're protecting activities that drive that long-term shareholder growth, including things like capacity expansions, IVD capabilities commercial expansions in targeted markets and sort of maintaining that balance.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes, I would also add, we continue to have productivity improvements on our gross margin side as well, right? So that's, of course, despite the reduced volume that we have seen this year. Some of those improvements are contributing to increased gross and operating margin as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Francis, maybe a 2-part question for you. Your guidance for the back half, it implies 1% growth. You just did 3% in 2Q. Are you \u2013 is the guide assuming things to worsen from 2Q levels? Because if I understood you, some of these are temporal factors. If I look at your inventory on-hand, I don't think your customers stock up 12 months.  So, shouldn't some of these factors were \u2013 how conservative is this guidance for the back half? And on Chemistry X, I think we've heard a 30% price cut 20%, 30%, somewhere in the ballpark. Does it have any implication to revenue growth for fiscal '23? Thank you. \nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So, thank you. Let me start with the first part of the question, which is Q3 guidance, sort of what's driving that number? And so I'll talk about some of the factors that are driving that number. If you -- and if you normalize the impacts I'm talking about, the growth is higher, and I'll come back to that as well. So, some of the factors that are driving it are the headwinds that I talked about. There is a headwind around COVID surveillance demand pulling back, that's playing out in Q3 as well. There's obviously a foreign exchange headwind and the tough compare with the UK Biobank that concludes in Q3. So, that's another factor playing out in Q3. We also expect the continued slower GDP growth in China growth and that will play on us. And then the two factors I talked about, sort of inventory management and the lab expansion. So, those are some of the factors that we factored in and giving the guide for Q3. And obviously, if you normalize for those factors, and you're looking at a significantly higher growth rate in Q3.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Francis, I have a two-part question for you on GRAIL. So, the first is just given the prolonged regulatory uncertainty here, is there a point where you could choose to walk away? What's your conviction level on getting this done? And then second off, that obviously now isn't the most accommodative environment for capital markets activity. So, in a scenario where you might have to spin GRAIL out? How would you fund the ongoing operations? I look at your balance sheet after the BGI payment and that you define you have your marks through European Commission, you have roughly $550 million of unrestricted cash. So, just talk about if you got to that, how would you finance a spin if it ends up there?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So, I'll start by saying that our focus is going to be continually to focus on and think about the things that create the most long-term shareholder value. And as we embarked on this process, as you said, we clearly felt that combining GRAIL and Illumina creates the most long-term shareholder value. I'll give an example, right. So, even on their own largely, the GRAIL team was able to achieve the fastest 12-month ramp of any cancer screening test in history, as we've said. And I imagine what that could have been in the power of Illumina behind it. And if we think forward, what could we do if we were able to take that test into markets like Europe and Asia and Africa, beyond the plans that GRAIL could happen. So, that's sort of what drove our thinking. Having said that, we're going to continue to assess as we work through this process. What are the right next steps? And there obviously are a set of nodes on the decision tree that would lead us to either spinning out GRAIL because the regulatory process doesn't go our way or contemplate other forms of exits, whether its dividend in the back or -- and so we're going to continue to assess that as we work through the regulatory process. In terms of your question around funding the operations, that's absolutely going to be a consideration as we contemplate the options and how we have to spin GRAIL out, right? So, the idea is that what you'd want to do is make sure that you protected the asset value to allow GRAIL to continue to execute on its mission. And so that means making sure that it's capitalized, so it can continue to be successful as well as it has access to future capital that will need for its own expansion plans. And that's going to be a combination of Illumina, but other shareholders too potentially and other people who would get capital both maybe at the time people who would get capital both maybe at the time of divestiture, but then over time as well. And so those are some of the considerations as we think about what a divestment would look like. How do we -- how would we set it up to be successful? And what's the path for it to continue to be successful? Obviously, those are not decisions that we're making today, but those are some of the considerations that would go into it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to our next update with you at Investor Day on October 3.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our second quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2022. I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.16 billion, up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Revenue was impacted by the macroeconomic factors that Francis referenced. As you know, we had anticipated the headwinds from the China shutdowns, the negative impact of FX and slowing COVID surveillance. Each of these were slightly worse than we expected, and collectively, they drove one-quarter of the variance between our expectations and actual results. The remainder of this variance was driven by the lab expansion delays encountered by a few of our large customers as a result of global supply chain constraints, as well as customer inventory and capital management. Nonetheless, overall sequencing activity on our connected instruments was strong in the second quarter, with sequencing runs in our high and mid-throughput instruments growing more than 15% year-over-year. We believe this is a useful reference that shows the general activity trend across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. For the second quarter, GAAP net loss was $535 million or a loss of $3.40 per diluted share, which included $609 million in legal contingencies recorded in Q2 due to the potential fine that the European Commission may impose related to our GRAIL acquisition and settlement of our litigation with BGI. Non-GAAP earnings were $91 million or $0.57 per diluted share, including dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, which increased 790 basis points year-over-year and 800 basis points from Q1 2022, primarily due to the increased impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to segment results, I will start by discussing the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue of $1.16 billion grew 3% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables grew 6% year-over-year to $744 million, driven by almost 20% growth in oncology testing. Core consumables growth more than offset headwinds from lockdowns in China, the completion of the UK Biobank program in quarter three of 2021, reductions in COVID surveillance, and negative FX impacts. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina grew 1% year-over-year to $119 million, driven by 23% growth in NovaSeq shipments, offset by a 14% decrease in the mid-throughput shipments year-over-year. The decrease in mid-throughput shipments was primarily due to headwinds from COVID surveillance and COVID lockdowns in China with NextSeq 1000, 2000 growth more than offset by a decrease in NextSeq 550. NextSeq 1000, 2000 instruments continued to grow year-over-year and the growth would have been stronger had it not been for temporary supply constraints that delayed shipments into the third quarter. NextSeq 1000, 2000 orders were up 20% year-over-year, with continuing strong adoption of our newest platform. During the second quarter, COVID surveillance contributed approximately $25 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $2 million in incremental instruments revenue, representing a decline of 55% year-over-year. This decline was driven by lower than expected testing samples and the expected decline in instrument shipments as COVID surveillance capacity was largely established in 2021. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $125 million was down 2% year-over-year driven by $20 million of one-time revenue recognized in 2021 from NIPT royalties received related to a patent litigation settlement, partially offset by increased instrument service contracts and contributions from oncology co-development partnerships. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $633 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to NovaSeq strength with continued demand from oncology testing customers, driving instrument placements, and consumables grow. Growth in the region was nonetheless lower than expected primarily due to customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management we have mentioned during the call. EMEA revenue of $308 million represented a 4% decrease year-over-year, but a 1% increase on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. Sequencing growth driven by clinical and large-scale research projects was more than offset by the UK Biobank program in 2021 and a decline in COVID surveillance revenue. Cumulatively, these significant headwinds and FX negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth by 20 percentage points. Greater China revenue of $118 million represented an 11% decrease year-over-year and a 10% decrease on a constant currency basis. This was slightly more negative than the approximately $35 million headwind to guidance we provided last quarter. As expected, the region continued to be impacted by prolonged COVID-19 restrictions and shutdowns that began in March this year. Finally, APJ revenue of $97 million grew 14% year-over-year or 20% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in the region was primarily due to increased NovaSeq shipments, which doubled year-over-year, driven by large-scale research project demand as well as strength in NIPT and oncology testing. Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. For Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 69.8% decreased 200 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, margin impact from one-time revenue from a patent litigation settlement in 2021 and increased freight costs attributable to broader global supply chain pressures. These factors were partially offset by a more favorable product mix, as well as a number of productivity initiatives we continue to execute. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $519 million were up $48 million year-over-year, due primarily to headcount growth and investments we're making in R&D to support the continued advancements of our innovation road map. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP core Illumina operating expenses were lower than we originally planned, as a result of lower performance-based compensation expense, given our lower revenue outlook and cost containment initiatives focused on select hires and discretionary spend, including travel. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $12 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $156 million for the quarter and consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. These expenses were lower than expected, as GRAIL managed its project spend in light of its lower quarterly outlook. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $125 million. DSO was 50 days compared to 46 days last quarter due to revenue linearity. Second quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $71 million and free cash flow was $54 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We have revised our outlook for the full year to represent the macroeconomic factors we observed through early August, and we assume will continue for the rest of the year. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated revenue to grow in the range of 4% to 5%, including core Illumina revenue growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%, and GRAIL revenue of $50 million to $70 million. For the full year, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we now expect core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 4.5%. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $25 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. Within core Illumina sequencing revenue, we now expect instrument growth of 1.5% and consumables growth of 5%, which reflects NovaSeq pull-through in the range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million for a system for 2022. We continue to expect pull-through for NextSeq 1000, 2000 in the range of $130,000 to $180,000 per system, and for the NextSeq 550 in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 per system. For MiSeq, we continue to expect pull-through in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 per system. And for MiniSeq, we continue to expect pull-through in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 per system. We now expect revenue from COVID surveillance in the range of $110 million to $130 million. While we anticipated a decline in COVID surveillance in 2022, the deceleration has occurred at a more rapid pace than we previously forecasted. As we navigate the macroeconomic factors we have mentioned, we're implementing multiple strategies, including prioritizing key innovation investments and critical hires, while pausing investments that can be made at later times. We've retained all critical investments in our innovation road map, including NovaSeqDx, Chemistry X, our Infinity long-read technology and our TSO portfolio. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 11.5% to 12% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 24.5% to 25%. We expect the consolidated non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14%, which continues to assume that the R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be repealed or deferred in Q4. And we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.75 to $2.90, which includes dilution from GRAIL non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $610 million, in line with previous expectations. Lastly, we continue to expect diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares for 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect consolidated revenue to be flat to 1% higher year-over-year from the third quarter of 2021. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 5%. We expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 20%. We expect consolidated non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which continues to reflect the negative impact from the R&D capitalization requirements, we expect will be repealed or deferred in the fourth quarter of this year. And lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares. I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yes. Thanks, Francis. So I think, first of all, our -- Dan, you asked about the forecast for the second half conservative, we believe, based on trends we've seen that it's actually a balanced forecast, right? There's always upsides and downsides. There are -- the factors that we saw in the second quarter, we believe will continue into the next -- through the rest of this year. To size them up, approximately 25% of the decline from our forecast, it really is coming from factors such as FX, the faster-than-expected acceleration on the COVID side and some of the declines we have seen in China, which are really more GDP-related effects on the research side of our business in China. The other 75% or so are related to the factors that Francis referred to, which are really around lab expansion delays due to broader supply chain constraints that are impacting the construction of labs at our customers and them bringing up new assays and instruments. And then, the impacts we're seeing from the macroeconomic headwinds on our customers that are causing a temporary reduction in inventory levels and also some capital push-outs. Yes. So Dave, thanks for the question. Let me reiterate what I said earlier, right? So two broad buckets, about 25% or so of that -- of the miss was really around things which included FX, the faster than expected decline in COVID surveillance. China and some of the effects, the macroeconomic effects that we are seeing in the second half of the year, which are not related directly to the lockdown with the slower than expected GDP growth that they're having, right? And then the other bucket, the 75% really was the two factors, the lab expansion delays, which, again, we expect to see coming back in 2023. So these are comments that we have heard directly from our customers. And then the second piece was around the slower than expected accumulation or restocking of inventory and some capital pushouts from a broader set of customers. Again, as Francis mentioned, we expect these to be transitory. I think in terms of the backlog, I will say that the backlog that we're exiting Q2 with a strong backlog of $1.1 billion. This is in line with what we have seen in the previous six quarters. Again, backlog does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter as you would expect. But this, again, is very much in line with what we have seen in the past six quarters, which, as you will remember, were pretty strong. So, thanks, Julia, for the question. So let me take the NovaSeq pull-through question first. So no, first, let me address -- I mean, this is not about pricing pressures. What we -- as you know, the pull-through is really an output of a number of factors, right? So, shipments in the quarter divided by a number of instruments that we expect to have activated at a certain point in time. Now both these played out this quarter in a way that are transitory and we had not expected. So first, although the -- as Francis mentioned, right, the number of runs in our instruments were strong due to the inventory deleveraging, the actual number of shipments, which is the numerator of that calculation was slightly low. Also because we had customers that bought a large number of NovaSeqs in previous quarters and because of some of the lab expansion delays that you heard about, some of these instruments didn't come online, right? So the denominator, because of the way we calculate pull-through, was inflated. So we do see this pull-through number being lower in this quarter as a result of those two factors. However, as we look forward, given the strong number of runs growth that our instruments are seeing across a broad range of our high throughput customers, and given the strong market factors that are very intensive in sequencing, like MRD, like oncology testing, and things like spatial and proteomics, we do expect that in the long run, this number will continue to grow. And then I think you had a second question, which was \u2013 oh, the GRAIL factor. So, a couple of things, right? As Francis mentioned, GRAIL has already proven itself to be a very well adopted test. It is the fastest revenue growth first year after launch of any screening test on the market ever. So while GRAIL numbers have been somewhat lower than expected, from the earlier guidance, it is nonetheless a very strong test, and we see a really strong adoption in multiple hospital systems across the country. So we believe that the test ordering from these systems that have already committed to GRAIL will pick up. But for the time being, I think we remain very optimistic about the quality of the test and it's potential. Yes. Thanks, Kyle. So let me start with the 2Q piece on the mid throughput, right? So as I mentioned right there, the orders for med throughput really were very strong, right? So we saw continued interest in strong orders for NextSeq 1000, 2000. This is our latest platform on that, pickup considerably and while there was a temporary supply chain issue at our end, which prevented us from delivering these orders in 2Q. They have subsequently been delivered already in this quarter. So we are very optimistic, and we see very, very strong demand and interest in our mid-throughput platform, both on our research and our clinical customers. On the full year, so a couple of things, right? So you start with NovaSeq first, right? So we've had a strong first half of the year. Our orders for the first part \u2013 first half of the year were up 30% year-over-year. And as we mentioned, right, 23% growth in the second quarter.  Now this is for a platform that has -- it's now six years from launch, right? So we see extremely strong unprecedented demand even on the back of a very strong 2021 and we're excited about that. Remember also that these instruments have -- most of these instruments have now been deployed. We expect now that the pull-through on consumables on these instruments will come and will continue to accelerate in subsequent quarters and years. So, we feel very good about our portfolio, both in the high throughput and the mid-throughput segment. Yes, I would also add, we continue to have productivity improvements on our gross margin side as well, right? So that's, of course, despite the reduced volume that we have seen this year. Some of those improvements are contributing to increased gross and operating margin as well."

            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered revenues of $1.16 billion in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year or 5% on a constant currency basis. While sequencing activity across our markets was robust in the second quarter, with sequencing runs on our connected high and mid-throughput platforms growing more than 15% year-over-year and clinical growing even faster, our second quarter results were impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we expect to play out over the next couple of quarters. Specifically, some customers experienced supply chain pressures that delayed their lab expansions and others manage inventory and capital more conservatively. We also saw adverse effects of foreign exchange and anticipated COVID-related shutdowns in China. The robust sequencing activity levels, underlying growth of our target markets and our conversations with customers across the globe indicate these dynamics are temporary. During the quarter, we also made terrific progress on our innovation road map, and are poised to soon deliver the next generation of breakthrough technologies that will fuel the next era of genomics. Turning now to performance across our platforms. In high throughput, NovaSeq shipments in Q2 grew 23% year-over-year, our highest second quarter ever. Consistent with prior quarters, clinical customers, primarily in oncology testing, drove half of our NovaSeq shipments. In mid-throughput, NextSeq 1000, 2000 orders were up 20% year-over-year. Despite some shipments shifting from Q2 to Q3 due to supply delays, Q2 NextSeq 1000, 2000 shipments increased slightly year-over-year. Low throughput shipments were relatively flat year-over-year, even with the comparison to last year's COVID surveillance-driven volume. Turning to our markets. We continue to gain traction in clinical, with sequencing consumable shipments for the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year, and all of our clinical markets contributing to the increase. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen continued growth in our oncology markets. In Q2, oncology consumables grew almost 20% year-over-year. An area of note is our market-leading TruSight Oncology Assay. Shipments of TSO grew 45% year-over-year, and we now have delivered distributed comprehensive genomic profiling tests to every major market in the world. We have worked closely with large evidence programs to facilitate clinical utility and drive market access. And we have more than 10 pharma partners developing CDx claims with us. Most recently, we expanded our portfolio by co-developing a new TSO 500 HRD test with Merck, that leverages Illumina's work with Myriad Genetics. We also co-developed a pan-cancer companion diagnostic for TSO comprehensive EU with Bayer. Also in oncology, June marks the one-year anniversary of GRAIL's launch of Galleri. In that time, Galleri delivered the fastest ever first year revenue ramp of a cancer screening test. GRAIL continues to drive progress in clinical evidence generation and commercial use of their multi-cancer early detection test, Galleri. The number of U.S. health systems, partnering with GRAIL to offer Galleri continues to grow, most recently with the addition of Mercy, one of the 25 largest U.S. health systems and Ochsner Health, the largest Gulf South Health system. Also, GRAIL recently partnered with AstraZeneca to develop companion diagnostic tests that will identify patients with high-risk early-stage disease. AstraZeneca will use GRAIL technology to recruit patients with early-stage cancer for AstraZeneca's clinical studies, making cancer medicines available where there is greater potential to transform outcomes. More broadly, the trials currently underway for Galleri continue to progress. The NHS-Galleri trial in the UK, the largest multi-cancer early detection study, has enrolled 140,000 volunteers in just over 10 months, an unprecedented speed, especially for a trial of this size. The pending successful completion of the trial, the NHS plans to roll out Galleri to an additional 1 million people starting in 2024. This collaboration supports the NHS long-term plan to transform cancer care with three and four cancers diagnosed at an early stage by 2028. Additionally, GRAIL has completed a final analysis of its PATHFINDER study, with data to be presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress September 9 through 13. GRAIL has made substantial progress building a network of partners that will support ongoing adoption of Galleri. The commercial progress is proceeding at a more measured pace as health systems ramp-up. For these reasons, GRAIL has revised its revenue guidance for the full year 2022 to a range of $50 million to $70 million. Turning to infectious disease and microbiology, the genomic surveillance infrastructure built on Illumina instruments during the pandemic in more than 100 countries is now being used for other diseases like monkeypox. This network is enabling a quicker genetic assessment of this new disease as momentum continues to build for a robust global pathogen infrastructure. We're expanding our surveillance portfolio accordingly. In June, we provided select customers access to our novel viral surveillance panel, based on workflows implemented for COVID-19. The panel provides targeted sequencing for the 66 most critical viruses of global public health concern, including monkeypox and polio, and will be commercially available later this year. Our research and applied markets were relatively flat year-over-year, with growth in the Americas and APJ, offset by declines in EMEA and China. In the quarter, we announced our partnership with Precision Health Research Singapore or PRECISE, to sequence whole genomes of 100,000 Singaporean participants. Together, we will develop Southeast Asia's most comprehensive population study and gather deep insights into Asian genomic diversity and key genetic, social, environmental and other factors associated with disease. Before I update you on further advances in our innovation road map, I'll turn the call over to Joydeep. Thanks, Joydeep. Turning to our innovation road map, we have significant opportunities to reimagine the power and potential of genomics. Development and registration activities for NovaSeqDx, the first-ever high throughput clinical sequencer are progressing as planned and on track for a Q4 launch. We continue to get good feedback from initial customers on our Infinity Long Read technology with many saying it has the potential to replace on-market long reads for a broad range of applications, including human rare diseases. Infinity is on track to be available later this year for early access customers. In Multiomics, our partnership with SomaLogic to accelerate NGS into proteomics is progressing, and we expect to deliver our ultra-high throughput ultra-high plexity assay in 2024. Turning now to Chemistry X. Our next-generation breakthrough SBS chemistry, we've made fantastic progress over the last quarter. We're now producing flow cells using our new manufacturing process based on 300-millimeter wafers. We successfully tested Chemistry X on the new flow cells and the results exceed our expectations for quality, cost and speed. We're excited to showcase these breakthroughs and reveal how they come to life at the Illumina Genomics Forum. And we look forward to hosting you at our Investor Day on October 3rd, where we will discuss these technologies and our long-term growth strategies. If you haven't already registered, please be sure to do so soon. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Hi, Derik. So in terms of the lab expansion, what we saw happen in Q2 was a few of our customers that had plans to launch new labs or expanded labs experienced some delays on their own because of their own supply chain issues, equipment that they were expecting to get for those expanded labs didn't come in as they expected. And so we saw a few lab expansion plans delayed, some into Q2, into Q3 and then one into Q4 of next year. As you can imagine, we are very close to our customers. So we know the specifics of those lab expansions. And to be clear, those lab expansions are delayed, but still progressing. And so that's what's driving the number we talked about, both in Q2 and for the rest of the year. In terms of inventory, what's playing out is some of our customers that are looking to manage their capital more closely are holding less inventory on their site. They have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our supply chain. And so they're looking to trim back the inventory levels that they hold on their own site. And so from our perspective, we expect that to play out. It started to play out in Q2. It will play out a little bit in three and four as well. But in the end, their demand activity levels are going to match what we are seeing from the data that we get from monitoring their instruments. And there, the activity and therefore, demand continues to be very robust. As we said in Q2, the activity levels that we're monitoring on the high and mid-throughput instruments reflected a growth rate in runs that are greater than 15%. And so as we work through these transitory impacts, we fully expect both demand and therefore, orders to more closely match the activity levels that we're seeing. Yes. Thanks for that question, Dan. And maybe I'll start with the second half, and then I'll turn it over to Joydeep to sort of size the magnitude of the factors that we talked about. From what we are seeing and what we are hearing from our customers, the challenges that our customers are addressing are around their lab expansion delays, as I said, related to dealing with their own supply chain for the expansion of their labs. And again, tighter management of their inventory levels. And that really were some of the big drivers of the change in addition to a little bit of foreign exchange and so on. And so what they're telling us is this isn't really related to Chemistry X or any competitive issues. In fact, they're excited to hear about Chemistry X, and they're looking forward to learning more about it at the Illumina Genomics Forum. But really, what's driving the change are the factors that we talked about. And maybe I'll turn it over to you, Joydeep, to shed some more color on the size of that. Yes. So let me take both parts of the question, Dan. So let me start by addressing the consumables and demand point. You're right. We end up -- because we serve clinical customers, a lot of our customers continue to see robust demand. They're targeting, for example, cancer patients that need their tissue biopsy to then sequenced or ctDNA tests. And that is reflected in the activity levels that we saw in Q2. That even as customers were looking to manage their inventories more tightly, they continue to run their machines hard, right? So we said, overall, if you look at the run activity on the mid and high throughput instruments that we monitor, across our customer base, so we monitor, the runs grew 15% year-over-year. But in the clinical markets, that was actually higher, for exactly the reasons you talked about that our customers in the clinical markets, especially in areas like oncology therapy selection testing, which represents for us the largest segment that we serve, that they continue to see robust demand, and that was reflected in their activity levels. Now, as we said, our customers are looking to manage their cash more conservatively, so they trim back the amount of inventory that they're holding on their sites. I think they can do that as a one-time sort of rebalancing down. But ultimately, their ordering levels will match the activity levels that they have on their instruments. And so that's why we expect this impact to play out a little bit in Q2, a little bit in the coming quarters, but then order rates will match, we believe, the actual activity that we're seeing on their machines. Let me talk a little bit about the Sam point. So when Sam left, as we said, he left because of personal reasons, and he needed to be on the East Coast. And that's what we said when he left, obviously. From our perspective, our quarters tend to be more back-end loaded. And so, the impact that I talked about became more clear at the end of the quarter. And so hence, there was no color commentary at the time Sam left. Sure, Tejas. So in terms of helping our customers as they're working through the macro challenges, obviously, we remain close to them. The reality is we are core to their business and their revenue generation, and we are a very important supplier to these customers. And so while we can help them in the sense that, because of the strength and the resilience of our supply chain, they're more confident in maintaining less inventory on site that obviously helps them with cash outlays. The reality is they need to continue to service the demand they're getting, because that's what drives their revenues and their growth and their long-term success. And so we are not seeing a pullback in terms of activity levels from those customers, again, because we are core to their revenue generation and their success. And we'll stay \u2013 we're staying close to them. We're also very staying close to the lab expansion plans and making sure we were on top of when they expect to get equipment for the labs as they come online. In terms of pricing from our perspective, our thesis continues to believe that, there is a huge opportunity to expand the genomics market by continuing to drive the price for high-quality sequencing, highly accurate sequencing down. That thesis continues to hold certainly in the research markets, but also in terms of opening up new clinical markets. We're seeing promising work, for example, happening in areas like cardiovascular disease and neurological disease. And those will require both very large experiments from a research perspective, but also maybe different price points from a clinical perspective. And so we continue to march forward with the idea that part of our mission is to make genomics more accessible by driving costs down. In terms of Chemistry X and the instruments, the way we are thinking about it is there certainly -- we're certainly capable from a technology perspective of making Chemistry X available on instruments that are already on the market. So, that is a lever available to us. And as we look at the market, we want to be sensitive to the fact that if customers have bought an instrument that we launched fairly recently, that they may not have gone through their depreciation cycle. And so we'll think more about making Chemistry X available on those kinds of platforms. But if it's been an instrument that's been on the market for a while, and they've gone through a depreciation cycle, then there is an opportunity for us to help that market upgrade and not just take advantages of the innovations in Chemistry X, but take advantage of the innovations across all the other technology components, whether it's optics, for example, of data pads, and really deliver transformative new instruments. And that's how we're thinking about it. Yes. So, let's take both. In terms of the labs, and I think you're asking about the labs that are delaying their expansion plans. Who are they? And you're saying, look, some of the other life science tools companies haven't seen that. So, I'll describe them a little bit for you. First of all, it's a few customers. Second, they're obviously genomics-focused customers. They run genomics labs. And so you may not see that in the general life sciences tools market, but you'll certainly see that in the sequencing market. They tend to be customers that are growing. These are the ones that have expansion plans. So, they are successful customers. They're experiencing robust growth. And in fact, they're serving markets like oncology, for example, where they see significant increased demand coming and are expecting to -- and are building significant labs. And so these are large customers, they are growing customers and they are customers that are facing significantly increased demand and are looking to expand their labs. Now, their genomics labs and the primary -- they're pretty much Illumina customers. And so obviously, we are the ones that ride that cycle with them. And that's why you'd see it with us. And that's why you'll see it as those labs come online, that's why you'll see the benefit of crude to Illumina. So, that's the characteristics of the customers we're talking about. In terms of GRAIL, it really has been just quite remarkable to see the fantastic growth they've had in their first year. If you look at their first 12 months of June and in this June, they just lapsed their first 12 months. They are the fastest revenue growth of any cancer screening test in history. Now that's quite remarkable, right? They're also doing a fantastic job in terms of signing up health systems and employers.  And I'll give you another example of just how fast things are moving. So, in the last quarter, they fully recruited the 140,000-person trial that they're running for the NHS. Now typically, a trial like that would take years to fully enroll. And the NHS working with GRAIL was able to do that in 10.5 months. That gives you some sense of just the acceptance, the hunger in the market, the demand in the market for just such a breakthrough test, right?  The fact that you can identify 50 cancers across all stages and people are starting to get a sense of the results of they're making it into the market. Now what we're looking at. Now even with that toward growth base is, we're looking at the rest of the year, and we're looking at the ramp-up that's happening in some of the \u2013 in some of the health systems that have signed up and some of the employers. The GRAIL team has tuned back some of their estimates for the rest of the year. That doesn't take away, again, this is the fastest-growing cancer screening test we've ever seen in history. Yes. Sure, Patrick. So obviously, with the revised revenue outlook for the year, we are taking a look at our spend and exactly as you said, doing that balance. On the one hand, we're looking for areas where we can contain costs. That means pulling back on discretionary items, for example like travel and other discretionary spend. And we're also prioritizing the hiring that we're doing.  And so, there are some hires that we will put off because we don't think it's essential to do right now. So, the team is absolutely doing that book. Having said that and we're also protecting our innovation roadmap, as well as essential hires in other parts of the company as we scale the business.  We have very ambitious product plans, as you know and we're going to continue to protect that roadmap because that's what drives the success of our customers and our long-term success and that's what creates the long-term shareholder value in the company. So that's the balance we're doing. We're protecting the innovation roadmaps. We're protecting activities that drive that long-term shareholder growth, including things like capacity expansions, IVD capabilities commercial expansions in targeted markets and sort of maintaining that balance. Yes. So, thank you. Let me start with the first part of the question, which is Q3 guidance, sort of what's driving that number? And so I'll talk about some of the factors that are driving that number. If you -- and if you normalize the impacts I'm talking about, the growth is higher, and I'll come back to that as well. So, some of the factors that are driving it are the headwinds that I talked about. There is a headwind around COVID surveillance demand pulling back, that's playing out in Q3 as well. There's obviously a foreign exchange headwind and the tough compare with the UK Biobank that concludes in Q3. So, that's another factor playing out in Q3. We also expect the continued slower GDP growth in China growth and that will play on us. And then the two factors I talked about, sort of inventory management and the lab expansion. So, those are some of the factors that we factored in and giving the guide for Q3. And obviously, if you normalize for those factors, and you're looking at a significantly higher growth rate in Q3. Yes. So, I'll start by saying that our focus is going to be continually to focus on and think about the things that create the most long-term shareholder value. And as we embarked on this process, as you said, we clearly felt that combining GRAIL and Illumina creates the most long-term shareholder value. I'll give an example, right. So, even on their own largely, the GRAIL team was able to achieve the fastest 12-month ramp of any cancer screening test in history, as we've said. And I imagine what that could have been in the power of Illumina behind it. And if we think forward, what could we do if we were able to take that test into markets like Europe and Asia and Africa, beyond the plans that GRAIL could happen. So, that's sort of what drove our thinking. Having said that, we're going to continue to assess as we work through this process. What are the right next steps? And there obviously are a set of nodes on the decision tree that would lead us to either spinning out GRAIL because the regulatory process doesn't go our way or contemplate other forms of exits, whether its dividend in the back or -- and so we're going to continue to assess that as we work through the regulatory process. In terms of your question around funding the operations, that's absolutely going to be a consideration as we contemplate the options and how we have to spin GRAIL out, right? So, the idea is that what you'd want to do is make sure that you protected the asset value to allow GRAIL to continue to execute on its mission. And so that means making sure that it's capitalized, so it can continue to be successful as well as it has access to future capital that will need for its own expansion plans. And that's going to be a combination of Illumina, but other shareholders too potentially and other people who would get capital both maybe at the time people who would get capital both maybe at the time of divestiture, but then over time as well. And so those are some of the considerations as we think about what a divestment would look like. How do we -- how would we set it up to be successful? And what's the path for it to continue to be successful? Obviously, those are not decisions that we're making today, but those are some of the considerations that would go into it."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. We maintained strong momentum across regions and markets in the first quarter. We saw particular strength in oncology, genetic disease testing and infectious disease and achieved record quarterly performance in the Americas and APJ. I'll share an overview of our results as well as our progress across our portfolio and markets before turning it over to Sam for additional detail. Before I begin, I'd like to extend my thoughts to everyone dealing with the war in the Ukraine, and we will continue to support humanitarian efforts to help the affected communities. Starting with our financial results. First quarter revenue of approximately $1.22 billion increased 12% year-over-year. We received record orders in the quarter with sequencing consumables orders surpassing $1 billion for the first time and we exited the quarter with record total backlog, a great leading indicator for upcoming quarters. Turning now to performance across our platforms. Sequencing instrument shipments grew more than 20% year-over-year in the first quarter. We shipped a record number of NovaSeqs and received record NovaSeq consumables orders, demonstrating both strong demand in the instruments sixth year since launch and addition to our substantial installed base for future consumables revenue. More than half of NovaSeq shipments were to clinical customers and we saw particular strength in oncology testing as high throughput sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling become increasingly critical to cancer patient care. In mid-throughput, the installed base of NextSeq 1000 2000 instruments has now exceeded 1,000. Additionally, Q1 shipments for the P1 flow cell that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 nearly doubled our expectations. We're seeing strong adoption of the P1 flow cell from both new customers and customers moving up the throughput spectrum as well as broad kit utilization from existing NextSeq 1000, 2000 users due to the P1 flow cell's efficiency and cost effectiveness. Our low throughput platforms also continued to perform well and provide a great entry point to sequencing. More than one-third of shipments in the first quarter were to new to Illumina customers, further increasing our installed base and enabling adoption of sequencing across a broad customer network. Looking now at our markets. Oncology testing sequencing consumables grew almost 20% year-over-year, as we continue to help democratize sequencing in this critical area of health care. In March, we received CE IVD approval for TruSight Oncology comprehensive in Europe. This new in vitro diagnostic comprehensive genomic profiling kit, is the first distributed IVD for both DNA and RNA. TSO Comp IVD, covers a range of mutations and biomarkers associated with the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines, maximizing opportunities to find actionable information from each patient's biopsy. We're pleased with the early reception and excitement from customers across the EU. And we look forward to introducing TSO Comp IVD in other markets, including Japan, where we recently applied for regulatory approval. The TSO Comp IVD offering will build upon the incredible expansion we're seeing globally for TSO 500, which grew nearly 120% year-over-year in Q1. Also in oncology, customer and provider interest for Galleri, GRAIL's groundbreaking multi-cancer early detection blood test is growing. To date, Galleri has been prescribed by more than 2,400 prescribing physicians and GRAIL has entered into 34 partnerships with health systems, employers and insurers who are investing in multi-cancer early detection to improve outcomes. This includes GRAIL's recent partnership with Point32Health, the combined organization of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan. Point32Health's 2-phased pilot of Galleri marks GRAIL first collaboration with a commercial health plan in the US. Last week, GRAIL also announced a multiyear partnership with Munich Re Life US to provide Galleri as part of Munich Re's commitment to advancing cancer early detection and treatment. Munich Re and GRAIL will collaborate to enable carriers and distributors to offer Galleri to existing policyholders who are at high risk of cancer such as those aged 50 and older. Also, the NHS Galleri trial continues to progress, with more than 90,000 of the planned 140,000 participants enrolled. To support the increasing interest around Galleri and to further their R&D efforts, the GRAIL team has almost doubled in the last 8 months to more than 850 employees, with another almost 250 job openings. Looking ahead, GRAIL plans to expand its existing sales force for Galleri to reinforce launch traction and drive continued market adoption. Turning to our other markets. Genetic disease testing had another record quarter as we enable expanding coverage and utilization of whole genome sequencing or WGS globally. In the US, critically ill infants are now eligible for WGS in California, Oregon and Maryland through Medicaid, providing coverage for an additional 17 million lives. And last week, we announced an agreement with Germany's Hannover Medical School to implement the use of WGS for critically ill children suspected of having a genetic or rare disease. This project, like our collaborations with other children's hospitals around the world helps demonstrate how WGS can support earlier diagnosis and treatment for children in neonatal and pediatric intensive care. In reproductive health, coverage, reimbursement and evidence generation continue to increase, particularly in Europe. Both Spain and Italy have expanded coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing, or NIPT, with Germany likely doing so as well later this year. In infectious disease and microbiology, we saw a record quarter with incremental global investments in pathogen identification monitoring and resistance. While this was driven by COVID surveillance, we are also seeing traction for other pathogens, including tuberculosis. In March, the Milken Institute called for a network of multisector stakeholders to collaborate on data, insights and responses for early disease outbreaks. In the same month, the World Health Organization announced a 10-year strategy to use the power of genomics for global pan pathogen surveillance, demonstrating the growing trend for broader pathogen monitoring. For example, FIND, a Geneva-based Global Alliance for Diagnostics, established Seq&Treat, a global initiative using sequencing for drug-resistant tuberculosis which affects nearly 0.5 million people globally each year. We're providing instruments to help Seq&Treat accelerate discovery for the half of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who are not currently successfully treated. In our research and applied markets, we continue to see genomic research expanding across applications and disease states. Lab budgets, specifically for NGS are increasing, including for both academic labs growing approximately 9.5% and pharmaceutical and industry labs growing at approximately 14%. As part of our efforts to support growth in genomic research, we recently partnered with Allelica to provide cutting-edge polygenic risk score digital tools to our customers. With Allelica's software, researchers can better identify individuals with high genetic susceptibility for developing life-threatening diseases. Also in research, increasing utilization and demand for multi-omics, particularly proteomics is driving sequencing growth and opportunities. Our partnership with SomaLogic to codevelop a high plexity, high sensitivity and high specificity proteomics assay is progressing well. Together, we look forward to empowering the next generation of novel insights. Another fast developing area is the integration of multiomic and genomic data into drug development and clinical trials. Drug development R&D spend is more than $123 billion annually, yet more than 90% of drugs that enter Phase I clinical trials fail to reach clinical approval, with fewer than 70 entering the market each year. A main contributor to this high failure rate is target selection, where genomic-based methods can more than double success rates and dramatically improve cost and speed to market. Because more than 85% of the human proteome cannot currently be targeted pharmacologically, we are excited to support genetic lead discovery and emerging drug modalities that could significantly expand the total number of potential therapeutic targets. In addition to our partnership with Nashville Biosciences, today, we announced a partnership with Deerfield Management. This first of its kind collaboration will combine Illumina's genetic and AI-led approach to discovery with Deerfield's expertise in preclinical and clinical development. Together, we plan to translate genetic insights into new therapies across diseases with unmet medical needs and drive a step change in the pace and efficiency of drug development. This will ultimately help more patients access potentially life-changing therapies. We also recently announced a collaboration with Janssen to accelerate development of precision medicines. This includes developing companion diagnostics across our new TSO Comp IVD and exploring discovery and research initiatives for drug and biomarker targets across disease states. These collaborations are a few of what we expect will be many pharmaceutical strategic partnerships, leveraging the power of Illumina to create precision medicine at scale. Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter performance, including 20% sequencing instruments growth and sequencing consumables orders surpassing $1 billion for the first time. The significant ongoing growth in our installed base as well as our record backlog exiting the quarter lay the groundwork for continued acceleration of our business in the coming quarters. I'm also really excited about the work we're doing with our collaboration partners. These efforts underpin our ongoing progress in driving sequencing trends to improve human health. I'll now turn the call over to Sam to discuss additional details on our results and outlook. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our first quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL then conclude with our current outlook for 2022. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. Our record first quarter revenue of $1.223 billion grew 12% year-over-year, with core Illumina sequencing instruments growing at 20% and sequencing consumables growing at 13%. Sequencing consumables growth was solid across both clinical and research, with both market segments growing in double-digits. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $86 million or $0.55 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $134 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.8%, which decreased 250 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to tax expense recognized in Q1 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The increase in the non-GAAP tax rate from Q4 2021 was primarily due to the impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to segment results, I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $1.221 billion. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $784 million, driven by the growing NovaSeq installed base across clinical and research markets. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina reached a new high, growing 20% year-over-year to $212 million. This was driven by another record quarter of NovaSeq system shipments, resulting from accelerating demand in oncology testing, which accounted for almost 40% of the NovaSeq shipments for the quarter. We also continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1000, 2000 from new to Illumina customers, who represented more than a third of the shipments for the quarter. During the first quarter, COVID-19 surveillance contributed approximately $53 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $7 million in incremental instruments revenue, driven by the sustained focus on pathogen surveillance. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $111 million was up slightly year-over-year, driven by growth in instrument service contracts. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $646 million, growing 15% compared to the prior year period. Growth in the region was primarily driven by strength in three key areas: first, continued sample growth in oncology therapy selection; second, emerging applications such as single cell and proteomics; and third, pathogen surveillance initiatives. EMEA delivered revenue of $316 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year, driven by strength across both clinical end markets and emerging markets, partially offset by the conclusion of the UK Biobank program in the third quarter of 2021 as expected. EMEA growth was modestly impacted by lower shipments to Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine. Greater China revenue of $127 million was flat year-over-year as the region's robust clinical demand in hospitals was offset by COVID-19 restrictions that began in March. Finally, APJ revenue of $132 million grew 33% year-over-year with stronger than expected growth from large-scale research projects, oncology and genetic disease testing and pathogen surveillance initiatives. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 70.2% decreased 30 basis points year-over-year due primarily to increased freight costs attributable to broader global supply chain pressures. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $505 million were up $85 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth and investments we are making in R&D and operations to support the growth and scale of our business. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP core Illumina operating expenses for the first quarter were roughly $15 million lower than we expected as a result of the slower hiring and timing of project spend shifting into the second quarter. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. GRAIL's non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $139 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $15 million lower than we expected due to timing of spend shifting to the second quarter. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $172 million. DSO was 46 days compared to 49 days last quarter. First quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $61 million and free cash flow was $111 million and we did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 14% to 16% for 2022, including core Illumina revenue growth of 13% to 15% and GRAIL revenue of $70 million to $90 million. And we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.20, which includes dilution from GRAIL of $3.75 in line with previous expectations. We are reaffirming all other financial guidance for full year 2022, we provided in February, with the exception of our consolidated non-GAAP tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Our outlook for 2022 assumes the lockdowns in China eased by June and our business in China recovers in the second half of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect consolidated revenue to increase 7% to 9% year-over-year from the second quarter of 2021, including an approximately 300 basis point headwind on overall revenue growth related to current COVID-related shutdowns in China. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat sequentially from the first quarter of 2022. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 10%, with the sequential decrease from Q1 2022, driven primarily by a $60 million increase in core Illumina operating expenses and the $25 million increase in GRAIL operating expenses. The expected increase in operating expenses are driven primarily by our typical ramp in compensation-related expenses, including our merit increase cycle, the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q2 from Q1 and the ramp in GRAIL's operating expenses. We expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 23% in the second quarter. We expect the second quarter consolidated non-GAAP tax rate to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 18%. And lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares.  I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks.\nFrancis deSouza: Thanks, Sam. As we look ahead, our business fundamentals remain very strong. The continued growth in our installed base, our record backlog exiting Q1 and the increasing volumes we're seeing as customers pursue higher intensity sequencing applications all bode well for future growth, especially in the second half of this year.  We also continue to drive increased access and deliver breakthrough genomic innovations. We're making progress across our innovation pipeline with data and excitement building around our breakthrough Chemistry X, our infinity Long Read technology and our NovaSeq Dx platform. We will provide additional updates on these technologies in the coming months and we look forward to welcoming thousands of customers from around the world to the Illumina Genomics Forum in late September.  Also, we are pleased to invite you to join us this fall for our Investor Day which will be held Monday, October 3 in San Diego, following the Illumina Genomics Forum. We will be announcing additional details in the coming days. Across our global business, we are at the forefront of genomics in health care. We're excited to deliver new technologies, collaborate with pioneering partners, Champion patient access and support incredible researchers and clinicians around the world, as we collectively unleash the power of genomics for the betterment of human health. I'll now invite the operator, to open for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Dan Brennan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I have a couple parter, just to kick it off, Francis and Sam. First part is on China, 10% of your revenues, you talked about the headwind in Q2. Can you just give us a sense of how it played out for you in Q1? It was flat, obviously, a pretty big deceleration. Just wondering, how much China really took away from what you expected in kind of 1Q. Second part of the question is on instruments and consumables for NGS. You're kind of maintaining all your guidance numbers. I believe, you were kind of thinking about 10% instrument growth, and I believe 18% consumable growth for the year. You obviously trended above that on instruments in Q1. And you were below that on consumables. So just walk us through, particularly in consumables, kind of how the year is going to play out and was 1Q impacted, whether it be by China by anything else. And then, the final part of the question is just AGBT. Presumably, we're going to get the update on Infinity there. Are we going to learn anything on Chemistry X or that's going to have to wait for the fall. Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yeah. Hi Dan. Thanks for the question. So this is Sam. I'll start with the first two questions, and then, I'll turn it over to Francis on the AGBT question. So with regards to China, China was approximately $10 million lower than our expectations in Q1, and that was really all driven by the restrictions that we saw in March. So as you know, in March, we saw really large significant restrictions in Shanghai, basically shutting the whole city down. But also, we saw restrictions in a number of other cities as well, and that got reflected with about a $10 million downside in Q1. As we said in Q2, we expect a 300 basis points headwind on overall company growth in China. So all in all, I would say in the first half, it's about a $45 million headwind for China on our results. But we are expecting that by June, the restrictions start to ease. We're already seeing promising things in Shanghai. Beijing, I think there's mass testing going on. And so we're keeping obviously close to that situation. But we're optimistic that as we get into June and beyond, this will start to ease. The underlying fundamentals of demand in China are really strong. Our backlog is up as we enter into Q2. It's higher than the last two quarters. We've added new hospitals, almost 38 hospitals that we've added into our installed base. We're increasing our penetration in hospitals. The question is really just about restrictions and the ability to get products to customers just given the fact that there's, shutdowns. With regards to your second question on instruments and consumables, yeah, we had a very strong start to the year with regards to instruments, over 20% growth. We said going into the year that this is going to be a more, I would say, less back-end loaded year for instruments. We're going to have a strong start. It's going to be more, I would say, sequentially even in terms of instruments. So we are still reiterating our guide for 10% growth. We had a very strong backlog. And we still do going into Q1. And so we are basically shipping and delivering on that backlog as you saw in Q1 with our strong results. And with regards to consumables, consumables actually were better than expectations in Q1. So they grew by 13% and they were better than what we expected in Q1, even with the impact of China. As you think about Q1, think about some of the impacts in Q1 of last year that actually muted some of the growth of 13%. If you normalize for those, things like the U.K. Biobank, in Q1 of 2021, which was a $20 million benefit, we had some stocking in Q1 of 2021, which was also about a $20 million one-time impact. If you normalize for those, consumables would have grown in the high-teens. So we still have a lot of confidence in terms of our guide of 18% in consumables for the full year. I'll turn to Francis.\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah, Dan, let me take the questions about Chemistry X and Infinity. The teams are making really good progress in both. Our strategy is going to be on Infinity to have more customer data come out over the course of the rest of the year as we get closer to launching Infinity. And then with Chemistry X, you will absolutely have a lot more information at the customer event and then at the investor event as well. And then between now and then to the extent that there is some new material data to show, we will bring it out.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Dan Arias. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDan Arias: Yeah. Hi, guys, thanks for question. Francis, maybe just on a similar vein -- in a similar vein. You mentioned last quarter that the backlog was 2x the prior year, and you're saying now here that it's record levels. So presumably, the backlog grew in the quarter. Is that fair? And then on the pull-through rate for the NovaSeq, I'm just curious whether you came in, in the range that you were looking for, for the year? Or did things that took place in March kind of take you a little bit below, and it's just a matter of getting back to that range later in the year. And then if I could, just on GRAIL, anything new on the European Commission and the timing related to the news around that process? Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yeah. Maybe I can jump in, Dan, and take the first question on backlog. So we have talked about the fact that instrument backlog was a record going into Q1. It was double the backlog that we saw starting last year. With regards to overall backlog, it also is a record in Q1. So let's be clear on what the components are. So we had record overall backlog in Q1 or exiting Q1. So definitely, the overall backlog grew, but I think the double was really more relating to the instrument backlog. So with regards to NovaSeq pull-through, let me continue with that. So we are still expecting pull-through to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.3%. So we are expecting that as we get -- first of all, we've had incredibly strong placements for NovaSeq. We had Q1 was a record shipment quarter for NovaSeq. As we get more and more installed base expansion and we get more shipments into NovaSeq, as you know, it's going to take -- usually, it takes about a quarter or two for those customers to ramp up to their usual pull-through, but we have every confidence that we're still going to be in the -- in that 1.2 to 1.3 pull-through range for the year.\nFrancis deSouza: And then let me pick up on the question around GRAIL and timing with the European Commission. As you know, we're engaged in two processes in Europe. One is with the European Commission around their phase two review. We continue to be engaged with them. The clock is paused as we are working with them to see if there are remedies that could get this deal approved and we expect a decision on that to come either later in Q2 or in Q3. We are also engaged with the EU General Court as we work through the jurisdiction of the European Commission to review this deal, and we expect a decision on that similarly to come either later in Q2 or early Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Derik De Bruin. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to follow-up on the instrument strength in the quarter. Again, another really good result after a strong run in 2021. I'm sure you know, there's increasingly more product launches coming in the space from a number of competitors. Some have already launched and we're in the process of launching more or less as we speak. I'm just wondering, has that shown up in any of your conversations with prospective customers? Are you competing more with any of these head-to-head? Is it coming in when you're having pricing conversations with them or any committed contract or anything like that? I'm just wondering if that's shown up on the margin, especially in the mid-throughput part of the portfolio.\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah. I'll start by saying that overall, we believe that the genomics market is a large and growing market that we're in the very early stages of penetrating. And so as we've seen before, and we'll continue to see, there's room for growth of multiple players in this market. And we expect that to be true for a long time going forward. The customers we sell to are among best and brightest in the world. They're obviously aware of the options that are out there, and we do have those conversations. And so all our customers, I think, are very well informed about what the genomics landscape looks like, who's available, what's coming and what to expect from the different vendors. So they're absolutely part of those conversations. You see the strength, though, in the numbers we put up, right? You saw the 20% growth in Q1. You saw the strong orders, strong shipments, you especially see the strength in areas like NovaSeq, for example, where we had a record year last year. We had a record Q1 in terms of shipments. And that continues to be because whether it's at the high end of the portfolio or in the next seat line or even at the smaller end of the portfolio, we continue to provide a superior value proposition that is meeting the needs of customers in terms of total cost of ownership, in terms of performance, in terms of price points. And that's, frankly, the job we have to continue to do, continue to earn our customers' business by making sure that, that continues to hold true.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Tejas Savant. Please go ahead. your line is now open. \nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good evening, and thanks for the time. Francis, I'll ask a two-parter, one on GRAIL and one on competitive dynamics similar to the prior question there. So you did about $10 million in revenue. You're still expecting about $80 million from GRAIL at the midpoint, so a fairly steep ramp through the rest of the year. Can you share some light on what sort of the uptake rate within the patient population here that you're assuming for Galleri in terms of your current health system and employer partners. And then on the competition, you've had some of the emerging competitors. Your talk of mid-single-digit price per GB sort of price points on their medium throughput instruments, do you see yourselves as having sort of enough flexibility to go lower perhaps at the high end of the portfolio, $100 to $200 genome? Or do you see enough delight in terms of other specs that you'd still be very competitive and stay the preferred vendor for your customers?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let's take \u2013 thanks for those questions. Let's take them one at a time. We are pleased with the way GRAIL is performing. So if we look at the traction that they got in Q1, not just the $10 million in revenue. But if you look at the traction they've made also with increasing the number of prescribing physicians to 2,400, increasing the number of partners across health systems, employers and insurers and up to 34. They continue to be on track to meet the revenue outlook that we laid out at the beginning of the year, the $70 million to $90 million. The other thing that they've put into place that we know will pay off over the course of this year and then certainly going forward, signing up the first commercial insurance provider here in the US with Point32Health. That's going to be exciting both as an employer customer of theirs because they're going to roll it out internally and then obviously, as they roll it out to their customers. The other exciting development was them signing up their first life insurance company. And that, we think, with Munich Re that we think is a good start in a segment that we think has a lot of potential for GRAIL going forward and so good traction there. And then maybe a little bit longer term, we're also excited with the progress that GRAIL is making with the NHS trial that they have. They're now up to 90,000 enrolled participants. You will recall that had a target of 140,000 and so they're making good progress. which then brings us one step closer to the next phase of the NHS, which would be expanding this to a million people in the UK. So good progress all around, I feel like we're on track to meet the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year. In terms of competition, we still feel like we have headroom in a number of ways. One, when we talk to our customers, they look at the total cost of ownership of a system. And so the price per G is one part of the equation, but then you have to look at things like the compute infrastructure. And if you look at what we've got in the NextSeq, for example, or the NovaSeqs, that extends well beyond just core sequencing. You've got advanced compute on board with the instruments with the FPGA arrays, which for other sequencers, you'd have to go out and buy that type of compute. In addition, we have things like the lossless data compression algorithms built in. Some customers can achieve a 5x reduction in the amount of data that's required to be stored. And so that's another part of the TCO equation that customers look at when they compare our systems with comparator systems. And so price per G is 1 part of the equation. You add all of those other things and you start to \u2013 it starts to add up just how good that the value you're getting from Illumina is. Having said all that, we also have a lot of headroom in terms of continuing to drive the price per G down. As you've heard us talk a lot about the innovations that we've got in the pipeline and the kind of headroom that gives us as we look forward, both on new instruments and potentially on existing product lines, too. So we definitely have a lot of gas in both of those tanks, right? One is on the end-to-end TCO comparison, where we have a very strong proposition, but then also taking each of the components and continuing to drive the price down because of the technological innovation that puts us on dramatically in the [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Kyle Mikson. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nKyle Mikson: Great. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarters. I appreciate that we'll be hearing and seeing more about the new products in the near term. But specifically, when should we expect to hear some commentary around the Chemistry X economics? And maybe just to establish a benchmark, would 20% to 25% lower pricing to our original expectation, that's 20% to 25%? The second question about GRAIL. I understand the biopharma and MRD collaboration revenue represents a portion of the GRAIL revenue guidance. But with respect to the Galleri revenue specifically, does the guidance assume most of the clinical trial revenue, like you were kind of mentioning Francis NHS Summit drive, et cetera, or actual diagnostic revenue like Intermountain, Alignment, et cetera?\nFrancis deSouza: All right. So let me take the questions one at a time. So Chemistry X will continue to give you technical updates as they become available. And the economics update will really depend on the instrument that we put Chemistry X into because it will be different, because ultimately, the economics of an instrument depend on the new chemistry but also every other part of the instrument, right? The optics that we put in there, the flow cells that you put in there, the compute infrastructure. And so Chemistry X will be definitely a heavy contributor to superior economics in an instrument, but to tell you the overall economics, we'd have to lay out the entire configuration of an instrument, and then we'll share with you what that instrument would give you. I can tell you right now that, frankly, 20% to 25% would be low. If you think about the road map of the new Chemistry, right? If you look at look at what we got with the last generation of Chemistry, right? So when Solexa came out in 2007, the project we got from them is $150,000 to launch -- to do a genome. Today, it's less than 600, right? So that chemistry, if you look at the lifetime of that chemistry. Now, I don't want to give all the credit just to the chemistry because obviously, there were innovations again, in optics and data paths and compute and everything associated with that. But very, very significant road map in terms of price reductions that were enabled. So this is the most significant update we've done in Chemistry since the original SBS was invented. And so you should think about the lifetime of this Chemistry is giving us a lot of headroom in terms of performance, but also in terms of price reduction. So I would be personally disappointed if over the lifetime of this Chemistry, you were just thinking about a 20% to 25% reduction. Secondly, let's talk about GRAIL. So the grow revenue for the year, what we said and reaffirm is that, the majority of the GRAIL revenue for this year will come from testing. There will be a component that comes from their pharma partnerships, but it won't be the majority of their revenue. And that's what they're working towards on the plan they're on.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of David Westenberg. Please go ahead. Your lime is now open.\nDavid Westenberg: I hit that mute button. Hi. With the point of the cost per G in competition, I realize maybe just getting a little bit old, but it didn't get my specific like thought or thought process or a specific question. And that would be the mid-throughput is definitely crowded. You've gone on in length about the competitive levers you have to pull in that. When we're talking about the high throughput market, somebody who's catching you in price per G or even higher than that, how comfortable do you feel that in the high throughput range of competitive launch would not be that detrimental to you? And should we use BGI as an example. And hopefully, this is a quick question for my follow-up here for Sam. And that is a lot of the cash flow generating. Cancer labs are in cost-cutting mode. Has the conversation around investment in sequencing instruments came up as part of that cost reduction? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: So thanks for that question. Let me start with the first one, which is -- we have always had to compete in the high throughput environment, and we expect to continue to. And I'll start by saying that the genomics market as a whole, as I said earlier, is a large and growing market that's in the early stages of penetration. And so we expect there will be vendors to emerge, there'll be vendors that -- some that go away. But we expect that there will be competition in that space, and that's what we've built into our plans. Having said that, I'm also very confident in our competitive posture in that market today and extraordinarily excited by the road map that we have in terms of enhancing that competitive posture. And I'll start again, what I said a little bit earlier, which is when you think about even just the cost element, it's really important that you think about the total cost of ownership, especially on the high throughput side. When you're generating so much data, the compute costs, the storage costs, the end-to-end workflow costs, all of that become very important. And so when you look at the levers of innovation that we have, not just to continue to drive the performance and price points associated with the core sequencing. But the levers we have around the end-to-end workflow, we have a terrific ability to offer a very strong value proposition in that high throughput market. And then the second question is on cost cutting.\nSam Samad: Yes. So Dave, thanks for the question. The short answer is no, but I'll explain why that's not the case that we're seeing any cost cutting on sequencing. So when you think about our customer universe, we've got about 8,000 customers, incredibly diversified customer base. But if you think about the commercial labs, clinical customers, I mean, sequencing is part of what drives revenue for them. So really, all the demand is driven by the end markets. And it's really driven by the need for testing and the fact that we're seeing very robust demand driven by robust reimbursement, market access and utilization in markets in oncology or genetic disease testing. So no, we're not seeing any slowdown driven by cost cutting because I think it's really driven by end demand. On the research side, we're still seeing very strong funding to the research market whether it's, again, into research in oncology, research and genetic disease or research in pathogen surveillance and other initiatives. So I think the short answer would be no, but hopefully, this gives you a bit of color why.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Puneet Souda. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi, Francis and Sam, thanks for taking the question. So Francis, based on what you're saying about Chemistry X and what potentially the new instrument can extract from Chemistry X, I mean, this should take you to $100 genome and well beyond that. So can you talk about what applications will start to open with the reduction that is well above 25% type of reductions that you're talking about? And what does it do to the -- maybe what does it do to the diagnostic mix of the customers for you longer term as well? I think they're trending around nearly 50% of the sequencing consumables. So maybe just help us understand on the applications and where the diagnostic customers can go in? Just a quick follow-up on the Sam. How much was pricing contribution in the quarter -- how much did pricing contribute in the quarter? And what should we expect it to do for the year in the guidance? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes, Puneet. There's a lot that can open up as we continue to drive the price of sequencing down because the reality today is that we're still at the very early stages of understanding how a genome translates into human health and human disease. We've unlocked the first clinical applications. NIPT cancer therapy selection. There are many, many, many, many more that we know will emerge once we're able to do the experiments of the size that we need to do.  For example, if you look at complex diseases like neurological conditions, whether it's autism or schizophrenia or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, what we're hearing from the research community is that if you look at schizophrenia, for example, in families, it's clear that there is a genomic component to it, but there's complex causality there. And the only way you can unravel the biology is by running cohorts that are not measured in the thousands or even tens of thousands, but are much bigger than that. And so there's a huge amount of promise to uncover and address some of the genomic underpinnings of neurological conditions. We need cohorts much, much bigger than we've seen historically. And that's -- those are the kinds of experiments. Similarly, when you think about what we need to understand about single cells and the heterogeneity of expression across the cells, across the human body, there are tens of trillions of cells in the body. So if you want to do even just a representative -- statistically representative experiment, you don't need just thousands of cells like people are doing today. You need sizes in the millions or tens of millions, and we need to understand that. And so those are the kinds of experiments that we're getting pushed on and say, okay, if you can just keep driving the prices down, it just opens up the large research areas which then will translate into a future area of new diagnostics, new screening modalities as well as new therapeutics. And so that's -- those are the kinds of big, big markets that get opened up. Today, if you look at the top 10 causes of death for mankind, genomics helps address cancer, one of those top 10. The reality is that if you play this out a decade, maybe longer, genomics is going to help us address all 10. But to really understand the biology, we need an enormous amount of research to be done. And then we need an entire new set of diagnostic screens and therapeutics. And so that's what gets enabled.\nSam Samad: Yes. And Puneet, thanks for the question on pricing. So maybe just to walk you through what we do typically, which is -- and this is what we did in Q1, which is very consistent with what we've done in past years, we usually take, I would say, a low single-digit price increase on some of our products, not all of our products. It's mostly on the reagent side and also on library prep. And as I said, it's in the low single-digit. This is very consistent with what we do every year. So it has some impact on the full year. It's embedded within the guidance that we've given. But it's nothing unusual compared to past years. We have not done anything that's a significant inflationary price increase that we passed on to our customers. We have not done any freight increases at this point. So we've done our typical price increase that we do in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Patrick Donnelly. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Francis, maybe one on the clinical market. Obviously, the momentum there continues to build for really strong numbers. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the most strength underlying there? And then obviously, you talked a little bit about the competition. How confident you are and kind of your positioning there as maybe some more people come after the clinical side?\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. The -- we are seeing real strength across the board in the clinical market. So if you look across regions, we're seeing a huge amount of strength, obviously, in Americas and so on. But even in China, where we talked about the COVID restrictions, we still had strong momentum in the clinical market and signed up, as Sam pointed out, 38 new hospitals as well. So what's driving that? One of the biggest drivers of that is oncology testing for therapy selection. The coverage that's been put in place for that, the move from smaller panels to comprehensive genomic profiling that requires larger panels. Now people looking at clinical exomes, that's driving a huge amount of strength. And if you look at a number of our metrics, whether it's the consumables that are being pulled into that market or even the NovaSeq, we saw, for example, I think it was about 40% of our NovaSeqs that were shipped in Q1 went to oncology testing customers. And so I'd start by saying that oncology testing for therapy selection is a juggernaut that drove a lot of our growth in the clinical markets last year. It's continuing to play out this year because a lot of the -- a lot of the underlying demand drivers are still strong. We also saw, though, strong demand in genetic disease testing, and that had another strong quarter in Q1. And some of the similar dynamics are playing out there. The dramatic expansion in coverage over the last couple of years is really helping fuel that demand. In addition, that -- those applications are sequencing intensive applications. So you're talking about clinical genome, you're talking about trios where those are available. And so that is continuing to fuel some of the demand in the clinical markets that we are seeing. And that has a lot of headroom in front of it in both of those markets. The clinical market actually is a one market is a market where I think we have a special strength, right? Because we have established over the last decade a number of things that customers really like. So for example, we have cleared boxes both the MiSeqDx, which got clearance in 2013, but also now we have the NextSeqDx that's available to customers, and we are marching down the path to deliver a NovaSeqDx. That puts us in a unique position at this point is that if you want to develop on a cleared box, we are a really great choice for you. In addition, we have some end-to-end workflows that are really exciting to our customers. TSO 500 is a fantastic product. And we talked about the fact that if you look at Q1, TSO 500 had really, really strong growth, growing over 100% from the previous year Q1. And then we're also continuing to see demand for our VeriSeq NIPT end-to-end workflow. So again, that positions us especially well against anyone else who's looking for -- in terms of customers looking for cleared workflows that they can buy and use. And then even customers that are running in LDT mode, they have spent a long time developing their own validated workflows on our instruments, even if they're using our non-DX instruments, but it's taken them a long time to build up their validated workflows and to bring those to scale. And so from their perspective, it's a better thing in terms of running their labs to just continue to expand the relationship with Illumina. And so those are some of the dynamics in that space.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Vijay Kumar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, Sam, on the guidance here for 2Q. I think at the midpoint, even backing out the 300 basis points impact from China lockdown, I think it's $1.25 billion that's below Street models. Maybe talk about any cadence issues. Is that a comp issue or street modeling issue? Talk about the 2Q guide? And then a related question on supply chain in Q1, earnings was -- came in, I think, 19% of our Street models. Any cadence issue of expenses, your incremental supply chain pressures that the guide is baking in given the strength of Q1 view? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yeah. So with regards to Q2, Vijay, and thanks for the question. I mean, I think the main thing is, yes, there is a 300 basis point impact on growth from China. There is an additional impact on growth in Q2 year-over-year as well, which I don't think you're factoring in, which is that back in Q2 of 2021 we had a onetime benefit from an NIPT settlement. It was $20 million. So that's an impact on growth as well. Now that's a year-over-year impact, not a sequential impact, which I think was your other question in terms of sequentially, whether there's anything there. I wouldn't say there's anything specific other than the fact, sequentially, obviously, that China is a $35 million negative impact in Q2. We are very -- still very confident with the guide that we have with the second half momentum that we expect to see and again I would say if you look at Q2 there is also the U.K. Biobank noise which we will lap at the end of Q3. With regards to your question around supply chain and any impact of that. I mean look supply chain is pressured I think for most companies its reflected in our guide in terms of operating margin. There isn\u2019t anything incremental that we are expecting to see in the second half versus the first half. We are expecting now, if you look at our operating maring profile first half, second half, our operating margins are roughly about 14%. This is consolidated in the first half, roughly around 17% in the second half. Some of that is driven by the fact that our revenues scale up in the second half. But despite the supply chain pressures that I think we're managing really effectively to make sure that there's no disruption and really offsetting some of the additional costs, I'd say our -- we are still very confident about our operating margin guidance for the year and the sequential growth that we see in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Luke Sergott [ph]. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk about the GRAIL adoption? I know you've talked about this a little bit. But outside of concierge and the executive health plans kind of the demand that you're seeing there from just the regular normal customer?\nFrancis deSouza: Yeah, sure. Outside of the things you talked about, we are seeing adoption from groups like employers. And it was really -- it's unexpected and it's exciting to see the range of industries where employers are signing up. The thesis that said you expect some of the early adopter industries like maybe tech, maybe financial services where they are -- they tend to be earlier adopters of benefit. So you expected to see some of those employers. But the range of industries represented was an upside surprise. So, for example, logistics and transport companies, media companies, it's a broader list than you would expect, and that continued in Q1 as well. They're also signing up beyond concierge systems. They're signing up health systems that like Point32Health that we pointed out, life insurance companies like Munich Re. And then there's certainly a retail element to what they're getting to and off their website through their partnership with Genomic Health. And that continues to grow as well. And that's also driving the -- their interest in wanting to continue to expand their profile in front of consumers. And so you should expect them to see more in terms of getting the GRAIL brand and the Galleri brand in front of consumers. They're also expanding their reach directly to oncologists, and we talked about the fact that they're expanding their staff. A part of that was expanding their commercial staff, their sales staff that actually calls on doctors. And so that will continue to expand demand, both in terms of bringing new prescribing doctors into the fold, but also continuing to expand the number of tests that a prescribing doctor orders.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of John Sourbeer. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJohn Sourbeer: Thanks for taking the questions. Just two parter here. On the GRAIL MRD assay. Any updates there on potential studies or milestones on the way as we look into the 2023 launch? And then on Chemistry X, details have been limited. But what has been the initial customer feedback there given the record NovaSeq backlog and potential for the new platforms in the horizon, just what a customer said within the initial feedback there? Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Sure. The GRAIL team continues to make progress in their MRD. We are excited about what that would bring to the market, using their sort of hypothesis-free tumor-naive approach into the market. We think that's a valuable assay for customers and allows them to get tested more quickly than an approach that requires a tissue sample, for example. So we think it will be a valuable add into the market. At this point, we don't have any additional updates other than the team is continuing to work on it and making progress. But as soon as we have some, we will make sure to share it. The initial reaction from customers on Chemistry X has been very positive, just building excitement around what it could do. Obviously, at this point, it's not tied to a specific instrument and sort of curiosity around when and through what form factor, they'll get access to Chemistry X, but there's general enthusiasm around the promise of the new era of chemistry for SBS. And they've all seen what SBS has done over the last 17 years. And so a huge amount of enthusiasm for the next leg of this journey. Sorry, that I will say though, having said all that, it hasn't really muted as you've seen the demand for our existing instrument, the NextSeq 1000, 2000, the NovaSeqs, we continue to see really strong demand for those instruments. And that's because our customers know we have a history of looking after our customers as we launch new products, right, by providing them very robust upgrade paths and looking at what they've ordered in the backlog and making sure they are happy about how we can move orders to new instruments, if that's what they choose. And so we've established, I think, a good track record of carrying people through an upgrade process and whether it's trade in policies. And so that track record over the last decade, I think, is helping in terms of customers feeling confident about moving forward with instruments, knowing that to the extent that we launch an instrument that upgrades any part of our portfolio, we will have very robust upgrade programs for them.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I had three questions on GRAIL. First, NCI recently had a blood-based [indiscernible] of multi-cancer testing, in that they talked about detecting cancer itself not being enough, the MCED test need to improve survival. So Francis, I was curious to get what your responses to that. Second, just latest thoughts on time line for FDA approval of Galleri. And then finally, just your level of confidence that the study is underway, the enrollment is large enough to get FDA approved. Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. So let's go through all three. I'll start by talking about the NCI commentary? And frankly, just the idea that, look, ultimately, you do want to see the impact on survival rates. And so, that's going to be important and that's something we're going to be tracking over the next few years. Obviously, it will take a long time to get that kind of data. But we will get it, of course. Now, having said that, we do know that survival rates for cancer are very different depending on the stage you catch cancers. But even for a deadly cancer like a pancreatic cancer, survival rates are higher, if you catch the pancreatic cancer early versus catching a cancer late. And the disease burden of cancer is so high. 10 million people a year die of cancer, 600,000 in the US here alone. And because the fact that you have a higher survival rate, when you catch it early, we know that 71% of the people who die from cancer die from cancers that have no screens, because you can't catch those type of cancers early. And so those are -- that the facts, the facts that we know that are fueling doctors to prescribe this test to their patients. And now they're up to 2,400 doctors that prescribe -- remember that this test was only launched in June. So we went from zero doctors a year ago to now 2,400 doctors that are confident and comfortable prescribing this test to their patients. And so, I think that's going to continue to build. And while it's continuing to build, we'll continue to build the data set to ultimately track this to survival rates. And so you'll get that data eventually. But in the meantime, we believe a lot of lives will be saved on the way. The team has continued to make progress in terms of engaging with the FDA. There is no new time lines to be announced. I don't think the size of the study is going to be the problem, and it'll just take time. I think they've powered the studies they need sufficiently, and the dialogue has been constructive with the FDA.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I'll now hand the call back over to Sally Swartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Great. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to our next update with you and in the close of our second fiscal quarter of 2022.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Francis deSouza",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. We maintained strong momentum across regions and markets in the first quarter. We saw particular strength in oncology, genetic disease testing and infectious disease and achieved record quarterly performance in the Americas and APJ. I'll share an overview of our results as well as our progress across our portfolio and markets before turning it over to Sam for additional detail. Before I begin, I'd like to extend my thoughts to everyone dealing with the war in the Ukraine, and we will continue to support humanitarian efforts to help the affected communities. Starting with our financial results. First quarter revenue of approximately $1.22 billion increased 12% year-over-year. We received record orders in the quarter with sequencing consumables orders surpassing $1 billion for the first time and we exited the quarter with record total backlog, a great leading indicator for upcoming quarters. Turning now to performance across our platforms. Sequencing instrument shipments grew more than 20% year-over-year in the first quarter. We shipped a record number of NovaSeqs and received record NovaSeq consumables orders, demonstrating both strong demand in the instruments sixth year since launch and addition to our substantial installed base for future consumables revenue. More than half of NovaSeq shipments were to clinical customers and we saw particular strength in oncology testing as high throughput sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling become increasingly critical to cancer patient care. In mid-throughput, the installed base of NextSeq 1000 2000 instruments has now exceeded 1,000. Additionally, Q1 shipments for the P1 flow cell that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 nearly doubled our expectations. We're seeing strong adoption of the P1 flow cell from both new customers and customers moving up the throughput spectrum as well as broad kit utilization from existing NextSeq 1000, 2000 users due to the P1 flow cell's efficiency and cost effectiveness. Our low throughput platforms also continued to perform well and provide a great entry point to sequencing. More than one-third of shipments in the first quarter were to new to Illumina customers, further increasing our installed base and enabling adoption of sequencing across a broad customer network. Looking now at our markets. Oncology testing sequencing consumables grew almost 20% year-over-year, as we continue to help democratize sequencing in this critical area of health care. In March, we received CE IVD approval for TruSight Oncology comprehensive in Europe. This new in vitro diagnostic comprehensive genomic profiling kit, is the first distributed IVD for both DNA and RNA. TSO Comp IVD, covers a range of mutations and biomarkers associated with the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines, maximizing opportunities to find actionable information from each patient's biopsy. We're pleased with the early reception and excitement from customers across the EU. And we look forward to introducing TSO Comp IVD in other markets, including Japan, where we recently applied for regulatory approval. The TSO Comp IVD offering will build upon the incredible expansion we're seeing globally for TSO 500, which grew nearly 120% year-over-year in Q1. Also in oncology, customer and provider interest for Galleri, GRAIL's groundbreaking multi-cancer early detection blood test is growing. To date, Galleri has been prescribed by more than 2,400 prescribing physicians and GRAIL has entered into 34 partnerships with health systems, employers and insurers who are investing in multi-cancer early detection to improve outcomes. This includes GRAIL's recent partnership with Point32Health, the combined organization of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan. Point32Health's 2-phased pilot of Galleri marks GRAIL first collaboration with a commercial health plan in the US. Last week, GRAIL also announced a multiyear partnership with Munich Re Life US to provide Galleri as part of Munich Re's commitment to advancing cancer early detection and treatment. Munich Re and GRAIL will collaborate to enable carriers and distributors to offer Galleri to existing policyholders who are at high risk of cancer such as those aged 50 and older. Also, the NHS Galleri trial continues to progress, with more than 90,000 of the planned 140,000 participants enrolled. To support the increasing interest around Galleri and to further their R&D efforts, the GRAIL team has almost doubled in the last 8 months to more than 850 employees, with another almost 250 job openings. Looking ahead, GRAIL plans to expand its existing sales force for Galleri to reinforce launch traction and drive continued market adoption. Turning to our other markets. Genetic disease testing had another record quarter as we enable expanding coverage and utilization of whole genome sequencing or WGS globally. In the US, critically ill infants are now eligible for WGS in California, Oregon and Maryland through Medicaid, providing coverage for an additional 17 million lives. And last week, we announced an agreement with Germany's Hannover Medical School to implement the use of WGS for critically ill children suspected of having a genetic or rare disease. This project, like our collaborations with other children's hospitals around the world helps demonstrate how WGS can support earlier diagnosis and treatment for children in neonatal and pediatric intensive care. In reproductive health, coverage, reimbursement and evidence generation continue to increase, particularly in Europe. Both Spain and Italy have expanded coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing, or NIPT, with Germany likely doing so as well later this year. In infectious disease and microbiology, we saw a record quarter with incremental global investments in pathogen identification monitoring and resistance. While this was driven by COVID surveillance, we are also seeing traction for other pathogens, including tuberculosis. In March, the Milken Institute called for a network of multisector stakeholders to collaborate on data, insights and responses for early disease outbreaks. In the same month, the World Health Organization announced a 10-year strategy to use the power of genomics for global pan pathogen surveillance, demonstrating the growing trend for broader pathogen monitoring. For example, FIND, a Geneva-based Global Alliance for Diagnostics, established Seq&Treat, a global initiative using sequencing for drug-resistant tuberculosis which affects nearly 0.5 million people globally each year. We're providing instruments to help Seq&Treat accelerate discovery for the half of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who are not currently successfully treated. In our research and applied markets, we continue to see genomic research expanding across applications and disease states. Lab budgets, specifically for NGS are increasing, including for both academic labs growing approximately 9.5% and pharmaceutical and industry labs growing at approximately 14%. As part of our efforts to support growth in genomic research, we recently partnered with Allelica to provide cutting-edge polygenic risk score digital tools to our customers. With Allelica's software, researchers can better identify individuals with high genetic susceptibility for developing life-threatening diseases. Also in research, increasing utilization and demand for multi-omics, particularly proteomics is driving sequencing growth and opportunities. Our partnership with SomaLogic to codevelop a high plexity, high sensitivity and high specificity proteomics assay is progressing well. Together, we look forward to empowering the next generation of novel insights. Another fast developing area is the integration of multiomic and genomic data into drug development and clinical trials. Drug development R&D spend is more than $123 billion annually, yet more than 90% of drugs that enter Phase I clinical trials fail to reach clinical approval, with fewer than 70 entering the market each year. A main contributor to this high failure rate is target selection, where genomic-based methods can more than double success rates and dramatically improve cost and speed to market. Because more than 85% of the human proteome cannot currently be targeted pharmacologically, we are excited to support genetic lead discovery and emerging drug modalities that could significantly expand the total number of potential therapeutic targets. In addition to our partnership with Nashville Biosciences, today, we announced a partnership with Deerfield Management. This first of its kind collaboration will combine Illumina's genetic and AI-led approach to discovery with Deerfield's expertise in preclinical and clinical development. Together, we plan to translate genetic insights into new therapies across diseases with unmet medical needs and drive a step change in the pace and efficiency of drug development. This will ultimately help more patients access potentially life-changing therapies. We also recently announced a collaboration with Janssen to accelerate development of precision medicines. This includes developing companion diagnostics across our new TSO Comp IVD and exploring discovery and research initiatives for drug and biomarker targets across disease states. These collaborations are a few of what we expect will be many pharmaceutical strategic partnerships, leveraging the power of Illumina to create precision medicine at scale. Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter performance, including 20% sequencing instruments growth and sequencing consumables orders surpassing $1 billion for the first time. The significant ongoing growth in our installed base as well as our record backlog exiting the quarter lay the groundwork for continued acceleration of our business in the coming quarters. I'm also really excited about the work we're doing with our collaboration partners. These efforts underpin our ongoing progress in driving sequencing trends to improve human health. I'll now turn the call over to Sam to discuss additional details on our results and outlook. Sam? Thanks, Sam. As we look ahead, our business fundamentals remain very strong. The continued growth in our installed base, our record backlog exiting Q1 and the increasing volumes we're seeing as customers pursue higher intensity sequencing applications all bode well for future growth, especially in the second half of this year.  We also continue to drive increased access and deliver breakthrough genomic innovations. We're making progress across our innovation pipeline with data and excitement building around our breakthrough Chemistry X, our infinity Long Read technology and our NovaSeq Dx platform. We will provide additional updates on these technologies in the coming months and we look forward to welcoming thousands of customers from around the world to the Illumina Genomics Forum in late September.  Also, we are pleased to invite you to join us this fall for our Investor Day which will be held Monday, October 3 in San Diego, following the Illumina Genomics Forum. We will be announcing additional details in the coming days. Across our global business, we are at the forefront of genomics in health care. We're excited to deliver new technologies, collaborate with pioneering partners, Champion patient access and support incredible researchers and clinicians around the world, as we collectively unleash the power of genomics for the betterment of human health. I'll now invite the operator, to open for Q&A. Yeah, Dan, let me take the questions about Chemistry X and Infinity. The teams are making really good progress in both. Our strategy is going to be on Infinity to have more customer data come out over the course of the rest of the year as we get closer to launching Infinity. And then with Chemistry X, you will absolutely have a lot more information at the customer event and then at the investor event as well. And then between now and then to the extent that there is some new material data to show, we will bring it out. And then let me pick up on the question around GRAIL and timing with the European Commission. As you know, we're engaged in two processes in Europe. One is with the European Commission around their phase two review. We continue to be engaged with them. The clock is paused as we are working with them to see if there are remedies that could get this deal approved and we expect a decision on that to come either later in Q2 or in Q3. We are also engaged with the EU General Court as we work through the jurisdiction of the European Commission to review this deal, and we expect a decision on that similarly to come either later in Q2 or early Q3. Yeah. I'll start by saying that overall, we believe that the genomics market is a large and growing market that we're in the very early stages of penetrating. And so as we've seen before, and we'll continue to see, there's room for growth of multiple players in this market. And we expect that to be true for a long time going forward. The customers we sell to are among best and brightest in the world. They're obviously aware of the options that are out there, and we do have those conversations. And so all our customers, I think, are very well informed about what the genomics landscape looks like, who's available, what's coming and what to expect from the different vendors. So they're absolutely part of those conversations. You see the strength, though, in the numbers we put up, right? You saw the 20% growth in Q1. You saw the strong orders, strong shipments, you especially see the strength in areas like NovaSeq, for example, where we had a record year last year. We had a record Q1 in terms of shipments. And that continues to be because whether it's at the high end of the portfolio or in the next seat line or even at the smaller end of the portfolio, we continue to provide a superior value proposition that is meeting the needs of customers in terms of total cost of ownership, in terms of performance, in terms of price points. And that's, frankly, the job we have to continue to do, continue to earn our customers' business by making sure that, that continues to hold true. Yes. So let's take \u2013 thanks for those questions. Let's take them one at a time. We are pleased with the way GRAIL is performing. So if we look at the traction that they got in Q1, not just the $10 million in revenue. But if you look at the traction they've made also with increasing the number of prescribing physicians to 2,400, increasing the number of partners across health systems, employers and insurers and up to 34. They continue to be on track to meet the revenue outlook that we laid out at the beginning of the year, the $70 million to $90 million. The other thing that they've put into place that we know will pay off over the course of this year and then certainly going forward, signing up the first commercial insurance provider here in the US with Point32Health. That's going to be exciting both as an employer customer of theirs because they're going to roll it out internally and then obviously, as they roll it out to their customers. The other exciting development was them signing up their first life insurance company. And that, we think, with Munich Re that we think is a good start in a segment that we think has a lot of potential for GRAIL going forward and so good traction there. And then maybe a little bit longer term, we're also excited with the progress that GRAIL is making with the NHS trial that they have. They're now up to 90,000 enrolled participants. You will recall that had a target of 140,000 and so they're making good progress. which then brings us one step closer to the next phase of the NHS, which would be expanding this to a million people in the UK. So good progress all around, I feel like we're on track to meet the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year. In terms of competition, we still feel like we have headroom in a number of ways. One, when we talk to our customers, they look at the total cost of ownership of a system. And so the price per G is one part of the equation, but then you have to look at things like the compute infrastructure. And if you look at what we've got in the NextSeq, for example, or the NovaSeqs, that extends well beyond just core sequencing. You've got advanced compute on board with the instruments with the FPGA arrays, which for other sequencers, you'd have to go out and buy that type of compute. In addition, we have things like the lossless data compression algorithms built in. Some customers can achieve a 5x reduction in the amount of data that's required to be stored. And so that's another part of the TCO equation that customers look at when they compare our systems with comparator systems. And so price per G is 1 part of the equation. You add all of those other things and you start to \u2013 it starts to add up just how good that the value you're getting from Illumina is. Having said all that, we also have a lot of headroom in terms of continuing to drive the price per G down. As you've heard us talk a lot about the innovations that we've got in the pipeline and the kind of headroom that gives us as we look forward, both on new instruments and potentially on existing product lines, too. So we definitely have a lot of gas in both of those tanks, right? One is on the end-to-end TCO comparison, where we have a very strong proposition, but then also taking each of the components and continuing to drive the price down because of the technological innovation that puts us on dramatically in the [indiscernible]. All right. So let me take the questions one at a time. So Chemistry X will continue to give you technical updates as they become available. And the economics update will really depend on the instrument that we put Chemistry X into because it will be different, because ultimately, the economics of an instrument depend on the new chemistry but also every other part of the instrument, right? The optics that we put in there, the flow cells that you put in there, the compute infrastructure. And so Chemistry X will be definitely a heavy contributor to superior economics in an instrument, but to tell you the overall economics, we'd have to lay out the entire configuration of an instrument, and then we'll share with you what that instrument would give you. I can tell you right now that, frankly, 20% to 25% would be low. If you think about the road map of the new Chemistry, right? If you look at look at what we got with the last generation of Chemistry, right? So when Solexa came out in 2007, the project we got from them is $150,000 to launch -- to do a genome. Today, it's less than 600, right? So that chemistry, if you look at the lifetime of that chemistry. Now, I don't want to give all the credit just to the chemistry because obviously, there were innovations again, in optics and data paths and compute and everything associated with that. But very, very significant road map in terms of price reductions that were enabled. So this is the most significant update we've done in Chemistry since the original SBS was invented. And so you should think about the lifetime of this Chemistry is giving us a lot of headroom in terms of performance, but also in terms of price reduction. So I would be personally disappointed if over the lifetime of this Chemistry, you were just thinking about a 20% to 25% reduction. Secondly, let's talk about GRAIL. So the grow revenue for the year, what we said and reaffirm is that, the majority of the GRAIL revenue for this year will come from testing. There will be a component that comes from their pharma partnerships, but it won't be the majority of their revenue. And that's what they're working towards on the plan they're on. So thanks for that question. Let me start with the first one, which is -- we have always had to compete in the high throughput environment, and we expect to continue to. And I'll start by saying that the genomics market as a whole, as I said earlier, is a large and growing market that's in the early stages of penetration. And so we expect there will be vendors to emerge, there'll be vendors that -- some that go away. But we expect that there will be competition in that space, and that's what we've built into our plans. Having said that, I'm also very confident in our competitive posture in that market today and extraordinarily excited by the road map that we have in terms of enhancing that competitive posture. And I'll start again, what I said a little bit earlier, which is when you think about even just the cost element, it's really important that you think about the total cost of ownership, especially on the high throughput side. When you're generating so much data, the compute costs, the storage costs, the end-to-end workflow costs, all of that become very important. And so when you look at the levers of innovation that we have, not just to continue to drive the performance and price points associated with the core sequencing. But the levers we have around the end-to-end workflow, we have a terrific ability to offer a very strong value proposition in that high throughput market. And then the second question is on cost cutting. Yes, Puneet. There's a lot that can open up as we continue to drive the price of sequencing down because the reality today is that we're still at the very early stages of understanding how a genome translates into human health and human disease. We've unlocked the first clinical applications. NIPT cancer therapy selection. There are many, many, many, many more that we know will emerge once we're able to do the experiments of the size that we need to do.  For example, if you look at complex diseases like neurological conditions, whether it's autism or schizophrenia or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, what we're hearing from the research community is that if you look at schizophrenia, for example, in families, it's clear that there is a genomic component to it, but there's complex causality there. And the only way you can unravel the biology is by running cohorts that are not measured in the thousands or even tens of thousands, but are much bigger than that. And so there's a huge amount of promise to uncover and address some of the genomic underpinnings of neurological conditions. We need cohorts much, much bigger than we've seen historically. And that's -- those are the kinds of experiments. Similarly, when you think about what we need to understand about single cells and the heterogeneity of expression across the cells, across the human body, there are tens of trillions of cells in the body. So if you want to do even just a representative -- statistically representative experiment, you don't need just thousands of cells like people are doing today. You need sizes in the millions or tens of millions, and we need to understand that. And so those are the kinds of experiments that we're getting pushed on and say, okay, if you can just keep driving the prices down, it just opens up the large research areas which then will translate into a future area of new diagnostics, new screening modalities as well as new therapeutics. And so that's -- those are the kinds of big, big markets that get opened up. Today, if you look at the top 10 causes of death for mankind, genomics helps address cancer, one of those top 10. The reality is that if you play this out a decade, maybe longer, genomics is going to help us address all 10. But to really understand the biology, we need an enormous amount of research to be done. And then we need an entire new set of diagnostic screens and therapeutics. And so that's what gets enabled. Yes. The -- we are seeing real strength across the board in the clinical market. So if you look across regions, we're seeing a huge amount of strength, obviously, in Americas and so on. But even in China, where we talked about the COVID restrictions, we still had strong momentum in the clinical market and signed up, as Sam pointed out, 38 new hospitals as well. So what's driving that? One of the biggest drivers of that is oncology testing for therapy selection. The coverage that's been put in place for that, the move from smaller panels to comprehensive genomic profiling that requires larger panels. Now people looking at clinical exomes, that's driving a huge amount of strength. And if you look at a number of our metrics, whether it's the consumables that are being pulled into that market or even the NovaSeq, we saw, for example, I think it was about 40% of our NovaSeqs that were shipped in Q1 went to oncology testing customers. And so I'd start by saying that oncology testing for therapy selection is a juggernaut that drove a lot of our growth in the clinical markets last year. It's continuing to play out this year because a lot of the -- a lot of the underlying demand drivers are still strong. We also saw, though, strong demand in genetic disease testing, and that had another strong quarter in Q1. And some of the similar dynamics are playing out there. The dramatic expansion in coverage over the last couple of years is really helping fuel that demand. In addition, that -- those applications are sequencing intensive applications. So you're talking about clinical genome, you're talking about trios where those are available. And so that is continuing to fuel some of the demand in the clinical markets that we are seeing. And that has a lot of headroom in front of it in both of those markets. The clinical market actually is a one market is a market where I think we have a special strength, right? Because we have established over the last decade a number of things that customers really like. So for example, we have cleared boxes both the MiSeqDx, which got clearance in 2013, but also now we have the NextSeqDx that's available to customers, and we are marching down the path to deliver a NovaSeqDx. That puts us in a unique position at this point is that if you want to develop on a cleared box, we are a really great choice for you. In addition, we have some end-to-end workflows that are really exciting to our customers. TSO 500 is a fantastic product. And we talked about the fact that if you look at Q1, TSO 500 had really, really strong growth, growing over 100% from the previous year Q1. And then we're also continuing to see demand for our VeriSeq NIPT end-to-end workflow. So again, that positions us especially well against anyone else who's looking for -- in terms of customers looking for cleared workflows that they can buy and use. And then even customers that are running in LDT mode, they have spent a long time developing their own validated workflows on our instruments, even if they're using our non-DX instruments, but it's taken them a long time to build up their validated workflows and to bring those to scale. And so from their perspective, it's a better thing in terms of running their labs to just continue to expand the relationship with Illumina. And so those are some of the dynamics in that space. Yeah, sure. Outside of the things you talked about, we are seeing adoption from groups like employers. And it was really -- it's unexpected and it's exciting to see the range of industries where employers are signing up. The thesis that said you expect some of the early adopter industries like maybe tech, maybe financial services where they are -- they tend to be earlier adopters of benefit. So you expected to see some of those employers. But the range of industries represented was an upside surprise. So, for example, logistics and transport companies, media companies, it's a broader list than you would expect, and that continued in Q1 as well. They're also signing up beyond concierge systems. They're signing up health systems that like Point32Health that we pointed out, life insurance companies like Munich Re. And then there's certainly a retail element to what they're getting to and off their website through their partnership with Genomic Health. And that continues to grow as well. And that's also driving the -- their interest in wanting to continue to expand their profile in front of consumers. And so you should expect them to see more in terms of getting the GRAIL brand and the Galleri brand in front of consumers. They're also expanding their reach directly to oncologists, and we talked about the fact that they're expanding their staff. A part of that was expanding their commercial staff, their sales staff that actually calls on doctors. And so that will continue to expand demand, both in terms of bringing new prescribing doctors into the fold, but also continuing to expand the number of tests that a prescribing doctor orders. Sure. The GRAIL team continues to make progress in their MRD. We are excited about what that would bring to the market, using their sort of hypothesis-free tumor-naive approach into the market. We think that's a valuable assay for customers and allows them to get tested more quickly than an approach that requires a tissue sample, for example. So we think it will be a valuable add into the market. At this point, we don't have any additional updates other than the team is continuing to work on it and making progress. But as soon as we have some, we will make sure to share it. The initial reaction from customers on Chemistry X has been very positive, just building excitement around what it could do. Obviously, at this point, it's not tied to a specific instrument and sort of curiosity around when and through what form factor, they'll get access to Chemistry X, but there's general enthusiasm around the promise of the new era of chemistry for SBS. And they've all seen what SBS has done over the last 17 years. And so a huge amount of enthusiasm for the next leg of this journey. Sorry, that I will say though, having said all that, it hasn't really muted as you've seen the demand for our existing instrument, the NextSeq 1000, 2000, the NovaSeqs, we continue to see really strong demand for those instruments. And that's because our customers know we have a history of looking after our customers as we launch new products, right, by providing them very robust upgrade paths and looking at what they've ordered in the backlog and making sure they are happy about how we can move orders to new instruments, if that's what they choose. And so we've established, I think, a good track record of carrying people through an upgrade process and whether it's trade in policies. And so that track record over the last decade, I think, is helping in terms of customers feeling confident about moving forward with instruments, knowing that to the extent that we launch an instrument that upgrades any part of our portfolio, we will have very robust upgrade programs for them. Yes. So let's go through all three. I'll start by talking about the NCI commentary? And frankly, just the idea that, look, ultimately, you do want to see the impact on survival rates. And so, that's going to be important and that's something we're going to be tracking over the next few years. Obviously, it will take a long time to get that kind of data. But we will get it, of course. Now, having said that, we do know that survival rates for cancer are very different depending on the stage you catch cancers. But even for a deadly cancer like a pancreatic cancer, survival rates are higher, if you catch the pancreatic cancer early versus catching a cancer late. And the disease burden of cancer is so high. 10 million people a year die of cancer, 600,000 in the US here alone. And because the fact that you have a higher survival rate, when you catch it early, we know that 71% of the people who die from cancer die from cancers that have no screens, because you can't catch those type of cancers early. And so those are -- that the facts, the facts that we know that are fueling doctors to prescribe this test to their patients. And now they're up to 2,400 doctors that prescribe -- remember that this test was only launched in June. So we went from zero doctors a year ago to now 2,400 doctors that are confident and comfortable prescribing this test to their patients. And so, I think that's going to continue to build. And while it's continuing to build, we'll continue to build the data set to ultimately track this to survival rates. And so you'll get that data eventually. But in the meantime, we believe a lot of lives will be saved on the way. The team has continued to make progress in terms of engaging with the FDA. There is no new time lines to be announced. I don't think the size of the study is going to be the problem, and it'll just take time. I think they've powered the studies they need sufficiently, and the dialogue has been constructive with the FDA."

            "content": "Thanks, Francis. As a reminder, our first quarter financial results include the consolidated financial results for GRAIL. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL then conclude with our current outlook for 2022. I will be highlighting non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. Our record first quarter revenue of $1.223 billion grew 12% year-over-year, with core Illumina sequencing instruments growing at 20% and sequencing consumables growing at 13%. Sequencing consumables growth was solid across both clinical and research, with both market segments growing in double-digits. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $86 million or $0.55 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $134 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.8%, which decreased 250 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to tax expense recognized in Q1 2021 on certain foreign subsidiary earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The increase in the non-GAAP tax rate from Q4 2021 was primarily due to the impact of R&D expense capitalization requirements implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to segment results, I will start by highlighting the financial results of core Illumina. Core Illumina revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $1.221 billion. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $784 million, driven by the growing NovaSeq installed base across clinical and research markets. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina reached a new high, growing 20% year-over-year to $212 million. This was driven by another record quarter of NovaSeq system shipments, resulting from accelerating demand in oncology testing, which accounted for almost 40% of the NovaSeq shipments for the quarter. We also continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1000, 2000 from new to Illumina customers, who represented more than a third of the shipments for the quarter. During the first quarter, COVID-19 surveillance contributed approximately $53 million in sequencing consumables revenue and $7 million in incremental instruments revenue, driven by the sustained focus on pathogen surveillance. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $111 million was up slightly year-over-year, driven by growth in instrument service contracts. Moving to regional results for core Illumina. Revenue for the Americas region was $646 million, growing 15% compared to the prior year period. Growth in the region was primarily driven by strength in three key areas: first, continued sample growth in oncology therapy selection; second, emerging applications such as single cell and proteomics; and third, pathogen surveillance initiatives. EMEA delivered revenue of $316 million, representing 4% growth year-over-year, driven by strength across both clinical end markets and emerging markets, partially offset by the conclusion of the UK Biobank program in the third quarter of 2021 as expected. EMEA growth was modestly impacted by lower shipments to Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine. Greater China revenue of $127 million was flat year-over-year as the region's robust clinical demand in hospitals was offset by COVID-19 restrictions that began in March. Finally, APJ revenue of $132 million grew 33% year-over-year with stronger than expected growth from large-scale research projects, oncology and genetic disease testing and pathogen surveillance initiatives. Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 70.2% decreased 30 basis points year-over-year due primarily to increased freight costs attributable to broader global supply chain pressures. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $505 million were up $85 million year-over-year due primarily to headcount growth and investments we are making in R&D and operations to support the growth and scale of our business. Despite the year-over-year increase, non-GAAP core Illumina operating expenses for the first quarter were roughly $15 million lower than we expected as a result of the slower hiring and timing of project spend shifting into the second quarter. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $10 million for the quarter consisted primarily of Galleri test fees. GRAIL's non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $139 million for the quarter, which consisted primarily of expenses related to headcount and clinical trials. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $15 million lower than we expected due to timing of spend shifting to the second quarter. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $172 million. DSO was 46 days compared to 49 days last quarter. First quarter 2022 capital expenditures were $61 million and free cash flow was $111 million and we did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2022 guidance. We continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 14% to 16% for 2022, including core Illumina revenue growth of 13% to 15% and GRAIL revenue of $70 million to $90 million. And we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.20, which includes dilution from GRAIL of $3.75 in line with previous expectations. We are reaffirming all other financial guidance for full year 2022, we provided in February, with the exception of our consolidated non-GAAP tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Our outlook for 2022 assumes the lockdowns in China eased by June and our business in China recovers in the second half of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect consolidated revenue to increase 7% to 9% year-over-year from the second quarter of 2021, including an approximately 300 basis point headwind on overall revenue growth related to current COVID-related shutdowns in China. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat sequentially from the first quarter of 2022. We expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 10%, with the sequential decrease from Q1 2022, driven primarily by a $60 million increase in core Illumina operating expenses and the $25 million increase in GRAIL operating expenses. The expected increase in operating expenses are driven primarily by our typical ramp in compensation-related expenses, including our merit increase cycle, the timing of hiring and project spend shifting into Q2 from Q1 and the ramp in GRAIL's operating expenses. We expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 23% in the second quarter. We expect the second quarter consolidated non-GAAP tax rate to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 18%. And lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding to be in line with our full year 2022 guidance of approximately 159 million shares.  I will now hand the call back over to Francis for his final remarks. Yeah. Hi Dan. Thanks for the question. So this is Sam. I'll start with the first two questions, and then, I'll turn it over to Francis on the AGBT question. So with regards to China, China was approximately $10 million lower than our expectations in Q1, and that was really all driven by the restrictions that we saw in March. So as you know, in March, we saw really large significant restrictions in Shanghai, basically shutting the whole city down. But also, we saw restrictions in a number of other cities as well, and that got reflected with about a $10 million downside in Q1. As we said in Q2, we expect a 300 basis points headwind on overall company growth in China. So all in all, I would say in the first half, it's about a $45 million headwind for China on our results. But we are expecting that by June, the restrictions start to ease. We're already seeing promising things in Shanghai. Beijing, I think there's mass testing going on. And so we're keeping obviously close to that situation. But we're optimistic that as we get into June and beyond, this will start to ease. The underlying fundamentals of demand in China are really strong. Our backlog is up as we enter into Q2. It's higher than the last two quarters. We've added new hospitals, almost 38 hospitals that we've added into our installed base. We're increasing our penetration in hospitals. The question is really just about restrictions and the ability to get products to customers just given the fact that there's, shutdowns. With regards to your second question on instruments and consumables, yeah, we had a very strong start to the year with regards to instruments, over 20% growth. We said going into the year that this is going to be a more, I would say, less back-end loaded year for instruments. We're going to have a strong start. It's going to be more, I would say, sequentially even in terms of instruments. So we are still reiterating our guide for 10% growth. We had a very strong backlog. And we still do going into Q1. And so we are basically shipping and delivering on that backlog as you saw in Q1 with our strong results. And with regards to consumables, consumables actually were better than expectations in Q1. So they grew by 13% and they were better than what we expected in Q1, even with the impact of China. As you think about Q1, think about some of the impacts in Q1 of last year that actually muted some of the growth of 13%. If you normalize for those, things like the U.K. Biobank, in Q1 of 2021, which was a $20 million benefit, we had some stocking in Q1 of 2021, which was also about a $20 million one-time impact. If you normalize for those, consumables would have grown in the high-teens. So we still have a lot of confidence in terms of our guide of 18% in consumables for the full year. I'll turn to Francis. Yeah. Maybe I can jump in, Dan, and take the first question on backlog. So we have talked about the fact that instrument backlog was a record going into Q1. It was double the backlog that we saw starting last year. With regards to overall backlog, it also is a record in Q1. So let's be clear on what the components are. So we had record overall backlog in Q1 or exiting Q1. So definitely, the overall backlog grew, but I think the double was really more relating to the instrument backlog. So with regards to NovaSeq pull-through, let me continue with that. So we are still expecting pull-through to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.3%. So we are expecting that as we get -- first of all, we've had incredibly strong placements for NovaSeq. We had Q1 was a record shipment quarter for NovaSeq. As we get more and more installed base expansion and we get more shipments into NovaSeq, as you know, it's going to take -- usually, it takes about a quarter or two for those customers to ramp up to their usual pull-through, but we have every confidence that we're still going to be in the -- in that 1.2 to 1.3 pull-through range for the year. Yes. So Dave, thanks for the question. The short answer is no, but I'll explain why that's not the case that we're seeing any cost cutting on sequencing. So when you think about our customer universe, we've got about 8,000 customers, incredibly diversified customer base. But if you think about the commercial labs, clinical customers, I mean, sequencing is part of what drives revenue for them. So really, all the demand is driven by the end markets. And it's really driven by the need for testing and the fact that we're seeing very robust demand driven by robust reimbursement, market access and utilization in markets in oncology or genetic disease testing. So no, we're not seeing any slowdown driven by cost cutting because I think it's really driven by end demand. On the research side, we're still seeing very strong funding to the research market whether it's, again, into research in oncology, research and genetic disease or research in pathogen surveillance and other initiatives. So I think the short answer would be no, but hopefully, this gives you a bit of color why. Yes. And Puneet, thanks for the question on pricing. So maybe just to walk you through what we do typically, which is -- and this is what we did in Q1, which is very consistent with what we've done in past years, we usually take, I would say, a low single-digit price increase on some of our products, not all of our products. It's mostly on the reagent side and also on library prep. And as I said, it's in the low single-digit. This is very consistent with what we do every year. So it has some impact on the full year. It's embedded within the guidance that we've given. But it's nothing unusual compared to past years. We have not done anything that's a significant inflationary price increase that we passed on to our customers. We have not done any freight increases at this point. So we've done our typical price increase that we do in Q1. Yeah. So with regards to Q2, Vijay, and thanks for the question. I mean, I think the main thing is, yes, there is a 300 basis point impact on growth from China. There is an additional impact on growth in Q2 year-over-year as well, which I don't think you're factoring in, which is that back in Q2 of 2021 we had a onetime benefit from an NIPT settlement. It was $20 million. So that's an impact on growth as well. Now that's a year-over-year impact, not a sequential impact, which I think was your other question in terms of sequentially, whether there's anything there. I wouldn't say there's anything specific other than the fact, sequentially, obviously, that China is a $35 million negative impact in Q2. We are very -- still very confident with the guide that we have with the second half momentum that we expect to see and again I would say if you look at Q2 there is also the U.K. Biobank noise which we will lap at the end of Q3. With regards to your question around supply chain and any impact of that. I mean look supply chain is pressured I think for most companies its reflected in our guide in terms of operating margin. There isn't anything incremental that we are expecting to see in the second half versus the first half. We are expecting now, if you look at our operating maring profile first half, second half, our operating margins are roughly about 14%. This is consolidated in the first half, roughly around 17% in the second half. Some of that is driven by the fact that our revenues scale up in the second half. But despite the supply chain pressures that I think we're managing really effectively to make sure that there's no disruption and really offsetting some of the additional costs, I'd say our -- we are still very confident about our operating margin guidance for the year and the sequential growth that we see in the second half."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I joined Illumina as CEO a little over four months ago. In this time, part of my focus has been on meeting with customers to understand their priorities, hear their feedback and develop more collaborative relationships. Our customer thinks highly of Illumina and our solutions. And they want to work-in strategic partnerships with us to move the whole MTS ecosystem forward. Now that we have announced that we will divest GRAIL, it has been easier for our customers to plan what the future looks like with Illumina. These meetings have been instructive and inspiring. During my recent trip to Europe, I was able to see first-hand how we're working with our customers, governments and the broader genomics community to accelerate whole-genome sequencing adoption safely and more effectively and to understand rare diseases in cancers as a part of the standard-of-care. I've also learned about Germany's modern project that aims to fully integrate comprehensive genomic testing into the healthcare system there beginning in Q2 this year. Within the hallways of our headquarters and several global offices I have also been connecting with our talented employees, who are committed to driving innovation and continuing to build outer genomics ecosystem. I've also had an opportunity to engage with many of you at recent investor conferences. These conversations are informing my leadership agenda and importantly have reinforced my confidence in Illumina's core business. 2023 was a dynamic year for Illumina. NovaSeq X has been the most successful high-throughput product launch in our history. We ended the year with 352 NovaSeq X shipments above the 330 to 340 we expected. Amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop that we saw many of our customers remaining constrained in their purchasing decisions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered higher-than-expected consolidated revenue of approximately $1.12 billion. Americas' revenue, which is more than half of our business was flat year-on-year. Europe revenue was up 17% year-on-year on a relatively easy prior year comparable. EMEA revenue declined 1%, although that included a 10 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. Greater China revenue was down 13% year-over-year, reflecting continued geopolitical challenges and local competition and mid-throughput. As I've noted before, China and our customers there are important to Illumina. We've already taken certain pricing and other strategic actions that are beginning to yield results. We will share more specifics on our progress there over time. Globally, we expect our customers will remain cautious. And for now, we continue to expect 2024 results to look very similar to 2023. While some macro headlines are encouraging, we haven't yet seen that translate to increased investment in our industry and therefore have not reflected in our guidance. Joydeep will take you through more details in our guidance in a few minutes. While we cannot control the external environment, the management team and I remain committed to accelerating value creations across the enterprise. As you are aware, I've laid out three key priorities that I believe will position Illumina for accelerated growth and profitability as market conditions improve. My first priority, driving our top line is centered on continuing to grow our installed base and helping customers accelerate utilization of these instruments in new and existing applications. I discussed earlier, how pleased we are with the first year of NovaSeq X shipments. The high throughput more broadly across the NovaSeq X and NovaSeq 6000, we placed more than 400 instruments in 2023. In 2024, we will support this growing installed base as customers launched large projects and more sequencing intensive applications like multiomics liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease or MRD. We anticipate ongoing high throughput instrument orders throughout 2024, primarily coming from further conversion of NovaSeq 6000 customers to the X from customer fleet expansion and long-term from new to high throughput customers. So, that said, given the significant number of placements in 2023, we believe we will ultimately ship fewer high throughput instruments in 2024. As you aware, XLEAP-SBS chemistry has been the engine for our X platform, delivering significant improvements in quality, turnaround time and cost. This quarter, we'll be making XLEAP available to our mid-throughput customers. On the existing NextSeq 1k/2k instruments without having to upgrade their instruments. This offering will further strengthen our leadership position around the world and drive progress in markets such as single cell, spatial and proteomics. As we grow installed base, we'll remain focused on supporting our customers as they launched new projects. This will build momentum for consumables demand this year and going forward. Already our efforts to develop this demand is paying off. In Q4, we saw higher-than-expected growth in X consumables sales following the late October, launch of our much anticipated 25B reagent kit. More recently in January, we launched a 1.5B kit, which together with the 25B and 10B flow cells allows us to offer a full suite of products to the NovaSeq X customers. While we will continue to see customers reduce their inventories of NovaSeq 6000 consumables as they transition to the X building pull-through on the NovaSeq X will drive our overall high-throughput consumables growth this year. Turning to my second priority. I'm focused on delivering operational excellence, by applying greater rigor throughout our P&L while sustaining innovation and growth. We've launched and multi-year effort, focusing on improving our margins through greater productivity and pursuing additional areas for cost-savings. In January, we took an additional action to further optimize our global workforce. Over the past year, we've made cumulative role reductions totaling approximately 12%. Our most recent actions included adjustment that we aligned with our late 2023, portfolio optimization efforts. You'll see us continue to take steps to not only manage our near-term cost, but also to build our agility to deliver more sustained growth and margins over time. Illumina is taking a highly disciplined approach to support our customers, employees and partners and to deliver shareholder returns. Throughout a range of macroeconomic environments. Moving to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quick as possible. Since joining Illumina, I've made an imperative to move with speed on GRAIL. In December, we announced that we would divest GRAIL, with a goal of finalizing the terms of the transactions by the end-of-the second-quarter this year. We'll continue to pursue parallel paths. The divestiture will be executed through a third-party sale or capital markets transaction, consistent with the European Commission divestiture order. To-date, we've been able to make swift progress GRAIL, From 10 has been confidentially filed with the SEC. Our advisors are actively moving the process forward on both sale and capital market path. The special committee of the Board, that we established in Q3 continues to help ensure this process move forward efficiently. I'm encouraged by the momentum we've entered 2024 with and I'm committed to seeing our initiative through for now I will ask Joydeep to share more detail on our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024.\nJoydeep Goswami: Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024, I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and in the supplementary data available on our website. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant-currency basis. Consolidated revenue was flat from the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's. Non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations, driven by higher revenue and gross margin and lower operating expense for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 55.4% for the quarter and 41.8% for full year 2023, compared to 29.3% in Q4 2022 and 26% for full year 2022. Although both periods reflect the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The impact of our effective tax rate in 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. In addition, our non-GAAP tax-rate for both years include a meaningful impact from the consolidation of GRAIL losses. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our full year 2023 core tax rate was in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted-average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $159 million. Moving to segment results. Core Illumina fourth quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis and included an anticipated reduction of approximately 5 percentage points from two primary categories. One, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represented approximately 3 percentage points. And two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that represented approximately 2 percentage points. Despite these impacts Core Illumina revenue exceeded expectations due to stronger than projected NovaSeq X placements and uptake in X consumables with strong early demand for the 25B flow cell that launched in Q4. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was flat year-over-year. Stronger-than-expected NovaSeq X consumables purchases were largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6,000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. As customers continue to adopt the NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by COVID, Russia and China factors that I previously noted, as well as the continued impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer's purchasing behavior. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q4 2023, compared to $20 million in Q4 2022. Turning to sequencing activity. Total activity on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 46% year-over-year in the quarter. Following the 29% year-over-year growth we reported in Q3. Sequentially, Q4 sequencing activity grew 13% from Q3. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina, of $161 million grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid and low throughput shipments due to capital purchase and cash-flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, as well as local competition in China. For NovaSeq X, we exited Q4 were 390 orders since launch. Our shipments of 79 NovaSeq X instruments in Q4 brought our total installed-base to 352 instruments. While we expect most of our NovaSeq 6000 customers to transition to the NovaSeq X over time, we're still very early in this transition. As of the end of 2023, our net installed base for NovaSeq 6000 was approximately 1,770 instruments, which reflects approximately 110 instruments that have been deactivated, between 2017 and 2023. The majority of these were in 2023, due to customer transitions to NovaSeq X. We expect this to increase in 2024 as customers continue to ramp up utilization of NovaSeq X. Additionally, going forward, we will be reporting our annual instrument installed base figures on a net basis, which accounts for instruments that have been decommissioned or inactivated since launch. The information included on this slide includes additional details to help you with your modeling. We will be posting this presentation to our Investor Relations website following our prepared remarks. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $152 million was up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7% for the quarter decreased 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the mix of lower-margin strategic partnership revenue, lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction and increased field services and installation costs, partially offset by lower freight costs. Core Illumina, non-GAAP operating expenses of $507 million were down $21 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based stock-compensation expense year-over-year. As a result of these factors and higher revenue, Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5% in Q4 2023 compared to 17.8% in Q4 2022. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $30 million for the quarter grew 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $167 million and increased $1 million year-over-year. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $224 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million and free-cash flow was $173 million. We did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.05 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. As Illumina continues to move as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL, given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment, the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on Core Illumina. Our guidance does not assume any impact for the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. Upon the completion of the divestment, we will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2024. As Jacob mentioned, our outlook assumes the current challenging macroeconomic environment persist in 2024 and tighter funding and budget pressures continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions. We expect full-year 2024 core revenue to be approximately flat from 2023, reflecting the following offsetting factors. We expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline in the high-teens year-over-year, driven primarily by a decrease in NovaSeq X instrument placements. The reduction reflects the expected transition in our adoption curve, the early majority, customers from early adopters and the lower backlog entering 2024, compared to 2023. We also expect capital and cash flow constraints to continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements in 2024. We expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to grow in the low-single digits year-over-year, driven primarily by modest growth in high-throughput consumables as increased NovaSeq X consumables purchases and sequencing volume outpaced the expected decline in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. Moving to annual pull through. Going forward, we will be calculating and providing pull-through figures based on the instruments' net installed base. As I mentioned previously, supplemental information is included in our earnings presentation. To help with modeling, which will be posted to our Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks. Importantly, this does not change reported revenue in any way. We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 approximately $700,000 to $800,000 per system in 2024 as customers continue to transition sequencing volume to NovaSeq X. We expect annual pull-through for NextSeq 1k/2k in the range of $80,000 to $130,000 per system in 2024, which primarily reflects the impact of customers transitioning to XLEAP chemistry as it becomes available on NextSeq 1k/2k. We expect annual pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance. We expect Core Illumina total sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations reflect the benefit of our continued gross margin improvement and expense reduction initiatives, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation, as well as the impacts from inflation and market-based merit increases. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.03 million to $1.04 billion, reflecting a Year-over-Year decrease of 3.5% to 4.5%, driven predominantly by the following factors. We expect lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments year-over-year given that we are entering 2024 with a more modest backlog, compared to the significant pre-order book. We entered 2023, following the launch of NovaSeq X. We expect the increase in NovaSeq X consumables purchases year-over-year to be largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. Consistent with the trend we saw in Q4. We expect an increase in sequencing service and other revenue year-over-year, driven by strategic partnership initiatives and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. For the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, for the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP net other expense of approximately $12 million, with the year-over-year increase driven primarily by lower interest income on our lower cash balance following the repayment of our convertible notes in mid-2023. I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Joydeep. Before we close and move to Q&A, I want to discuss what I believe success looks like, both this year and the years ahead. Illumina has the opportunity to truly drive the next-generation sequencing ecosystem forward. We will deepen our relationships with our customers and seek out greater ways to collaborate and partner with them to drive greater adoption of NGS. Our goal is to make our customers the heroes in their labs. And to support them as they expand their work in genomics and multiomics. In turn, this will help capitalize our market-leading innovation and continue to differentiate Illumina and maintain our industry-leading position across research and clinical markets. We will also continue to drive innovation that is focused on our customers' priorities. This includes evolving our sequencing platform and delivering greater sample to answer solutions. There is an opportunity to further integrate customers' workflow to build our share of wallet as we create greater value for our customers. Our comprehensive strategy work is well underway, and we will share more with you later this year. I'm excited to be part of Illumina's leadership team that is driving our unmatched core business forward. Thank you for joining. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon everybody and thank you for taking the questions. I want to ask just about the 25B chip release and what you're seeing in the field entering the early part of the year. As you know, 25B reduces the cost per genome to about $200, but it also requires customers to have enough samples to run to fully use up the flow cells. So what are -- what have you seen in the first few months of availability? What's spending on X consumables? How did that trend relative to Q3? And are you seeing signs in the field that sample access is not a problem as you see folks move to the 25B? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Doug. And, no, that was nice one question there. So let me start by saying that we've been very pleased with the pickup of the 25B since the launch in late November. In fact, it's did kind of performed all our expectations and have been very received with their customers. So we continue to expect that this will continue to really drive X performance, but also, of course, it's completely now unleashed the full performance of the instrument, and thereby, we also expect that the 25B -- the availability of the 25B will have more customers to jump on to the X wagon here. I think we are seeing customers being able to load it. Of course, many of them are still doing validation work, but we are seeing that they have a big enough projects to load the closeout.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. And just maybe one quick add right about 40% of our X customers so far have adopted the 25B.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Jacob, Joydeep thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just following up on that point. I mean sort of help us just understand how do you get to the low single-digit growth rate this year. There's obviously 25B5, there's reductions that are happening in -- from just the X install, cost per database is lower, China continues to be challenging and then the market backdrop is challenging too? So just maybe talk to us a little bit about sort of how do you continue to have confidence in the sort of the low single-digit sequencing consumable growth rate and I would really appreciate if you could provide us some context around and details around GRAIL as well. What's the progress there? Any level of interest that you're finding? And what are you contemplating for spend on GRAIL this year? Thank you so much.\nJacob Thaysen: All right. Thanks for that, Puneet. And let me start by the latter part of this question about GRAIL, and then I'll have Joydeep chime in on our expectations here on consumables growth. But as I mentioned, you know, we are very pleased with the announcement that we made here in December that we are now divesting GRAIL for sure and I'm actually very pleased with the progress so far. We have our advisers really moving ahead and now in connection and in conversations with rural parties. We are continuing to run a dual track, of course, can be a capital markets initiative or it can be a transaction. And so we still expect to be on track with the timeline we were previously talking about that we would have all the terms finalized by end of June. So we are -- at this point, we are not talking about -- since we are expecting to finish up with GRAIL this year, we're not having any guidance on the expenditure for GRAIL this year.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. And to address your question about the low-single-digits consumables growth, Puneet. So, let me start by saying we were very encouraged by the uptake of the 25B and 10B flow cells that we saw in the fourth quarter. We're also very pleased to see the elasticity, the growth in underlying sequencing activity being driven by ex-customers, right? So both of those are good. We saw that uptick on sequencing activity now for the second quarter in a row. So again, it's broad-based. It's both research and clinical customers. And it's quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth. So what's offsetting that expected growth in X consumables, as you rightly pointed out, is the expected price transition as customers move from the NovaSeq 6000 to the X. This is very similar to the price transition that you saw when you were moving from HiSeq to NovaSeq 6000. And then, of course, some of the expected again, reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers switch from one platform to the other, right? So those -- that is the really big piece on the -- what's leading to the lower or the low-single-digit growth rate in consumables in 2024.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, and I had a two-part question on the GRAIL. I know it was a confidential S1. When will that be made public? And the reason I ask is, GRAIL's operating losses were $700 million last year. It's really hard to foresee a capital market transaction with those kind of spend levels. So I would be very curious to see what the S1 assumptions are on GRAIL? And on consumable pull-through $700,000 to $800,000 on NovaSeq 6000, Joydeep, is there like a cadence perhaps Q1 we're starting at the low-end? And is the assumption we exit Q4 at the high-end of that range?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Yes, so let's start with the GRAIL question. And obviously, we'd like to provide as much information to all of you as possible. Right now, as you say, the filing is confidential. And I don't think it will be public available before very late in Q1 maybe dipping into Q2 here. So I think that's where we are at this. But as soon as it's available, we'll make sure you know.\nJoydeep Goswami: Okay And then. Vijay I want to be sure you're asking about NovaSeq 6,000 pull-through numbers and how they modulate through the year?\nVijay Kumar: Correct, Joydeep. Is there an assumption we start at the low end and exit the year at the high end or above the high end of the range?\nJoydeep Goswami: No, there isn't. I think, again, pull-through will reemphasize as a calculated number. So it's more of the total amount of consumables sold in any quarter divided by the number of now the active installed base in the quarter, right? So -- and we don't have an assumption in terms of quarterly spread on that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Hi guys. Thanks for the questions. Jacob or Joydeep on the 6,000 X transition and just sort of thinking about the clinical side of things. A big part of that bucket are these commercial labs that are watching their own margins pretty tightly and trying to find ways to be just more efficient. So are you sensing that maybe you could see X adoption faster than in maybe in a normal environment in order for those folks to take advantage of the cost savings? It seems like you're incentivized to do that, but I also know that the clinical wheel spin slowly, so I'm just not sure whether that's a factor for them.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Of course, it's a relevant hypothesis to come in with. What we have seen is that most of our clinical customers are using the opportunity with the lower cost of X to actually expand the depth of sequencing providing bigger panels and so on. So what we're seeing is that most of the current panels continue to run on the NovaSeq 6000 and thereby continue to also drive volume there. And then they are right now validating many of the new assays or the new assays that might not have been possible in the 6000 to trust and so on to be on the X. So we're quite encouraged about that. We've also seen several of our specialty labs customer now order tens of NovaSeq X. So I'm encouraged that we will see a lot of volume here going forward on this.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Subha Nambi with Guggenheim Securities.\nSubha Nambi: Hey, thank you guys. Thank you for taking the questions. You spent about $1 billion on R&D in 2022 relative to 2019, the revenue has grown at 6% CAGR. However, R&D has grown 12% CAGR. Why can't you reduce R&D spend in dollar terms from current levels over the next one or two years? Can you outline where the spend is allocating?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, thank you. You're right that we continue to believe that there's a lot of innovation that is required there by investment into R&D in order to drive the whole NGS ecosystem forward. We -- as I said, one of the things -- what I said previously, is one of the things that I was really excited about is the pipeline of innovation that we have in running right now and thereby, also there will be a lot of innovation coming out from Illumina over the next period of time here. And we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of the whole opportunities here in NDS, but even also multiomics and thereby, we continue to make investment into that. You're also right that there has been an increase in R&D, and we're certainly looking to change that trajectory over time. We still believe that a high level of investment is required, but you will see here over the next years that the percentage spending R&D versus revenue will start to come down.\nJoydeep Goswami: Just to add, Subha, I think we have made reductions in R&D over the last year. It's been very strategic in terms of specific aspects of the portfolio that we had considered as longer -- much longer time of payoffs or more risky. And we have also -- our overall R&D includes spend in certain areas like medical affairs, et cetera, that we were doing to support customers. And as they have matured, right, we have been able to pull back on investment there without affecting innovation.\nOperator: And we'll take a question from Mason Carrico with Stephens.\nMason Carrico: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So for high-throughput customers who have already purchased the X, could you talk about the conversations you're having around the potential fleet expansion? I mean what portion of those opportunities, whether it's orders or shipments have already come through and how many remain an opportunity this year?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, I think, I mean, we certainly see a lot of our high-end customers, the high-volume customers that started buying one or two NovaSeq X is starting to consider purchasing more instruments. So they're using the first few X to validate assays on. And then they want to expand into to -- use the additional Xs to actually run in production, but very few customers have still gone into production mode. And thereby, there is a real big opportunity in front of us. I think that less than half of our high-volume customers have purchased X so far. So I think there's still a lot of opportunities there. But I've also mentioned some of the high-volume customers that have purchased one or two have now put orders in for 10 instruments. So I think we're still in the very early stages, and there should be a lot of opportunities here, both in '24 and '25 to drive more placements.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. I'd just add, we weren't expecting to see that before the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So really, you're in very early innings there, and we do expect to see those fleet expansions come in, in this year.\nOperator: And we have a question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking the question. I'm actually going to hit on some of the competition coming in. A couple of different things we saw at AGBT, for example, a combination of spatial and sequencing on one platform. How do you see that stacking competitively? Would you pursue a strategy like that? And then on Ultima in the $100 genome, some of the specs look significantly better than it did a couple of years ago. How do you feel stacked up against the $100 price with some of your key bells and whistles? Thank you very much.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks, Dave. And of course, we're tracking, of course, everything that is happening out in the market and we take our competition very seriously. But I think you've also heard me on the multiomics place. I think you've heard me speak multiple times about multiomics. So we have an intention also to be in that space. I think we were not talking about moving forward as a starting point with proteomics here with our relationships with Stemologic. But I think you can see that -- actually, we believe there is many more modalities that can be available on the instrument. So I think the -- where we -- where Illumina is doing is that we will go out and provide that insight when we're ready to put something in the market and speak less about it when it's more in the future. Secondly, we feel with the NovaSeq X where we come out with a very attractive price point for a lot of different applications and not only a very few ones. So I think we feel that we have a very attractive solution. But I also remind you that it's not only the cost per sequencing -- that anymore, that is relevant, but also you need to look at the whole cost of the whole workflow, how many manual steps you have, how much waste you are, instrument spending and so on. So I think if you dig into the details, you will actually realize that Illumina has a very attractive and very differentiated platform.\nOperator: We'll take a question from Conor McNamara with RBC.\nConor McNamara: Hey, guys and thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Just a financial question on margins. You're guiding to 18% in Q1 and 20% for the whole year. So how do we think about the cadence of the margin progression? And I guess, same on tax rate, just you talked about a mid-20s for the core Illumina tax rate, how should we think about that in '24?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So the tax rate, again, is something that should be -- you should expect to be relatively constant as you go into -- and again, for core Illumina into 2024. And this is, again, core Illumina, right? We are not giving guidance this year yet on the consolidated number. In terms of the operating margin cadence, again, that is typically that does go up as the gross margins tend to go up as we move into greater volume through the year. In terms of operating margin, you will see a decrease in potentially in Q2 as the merit and the other inflation-related aspects come into play. But then you will see after that, a quarter-on-quarter increase as we move into the rest of the year. And then, of course, I think on the -- sorry, just one other thing, right? I know there's been some movement in terms of the R&D capitalization piece, but that is something we're monitoring very carefully. It is past the house, but it still needs to get through the Senate and the President signing. If we get that, you can expect a further improvement in the tax rate, right? But we are not building that into our assumptions at this point.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\nSung Ji Nam: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the MRD assay under development with Janssen, I was wondering if you might be able to comment whether that's a tumor-informed or a tumor naive approach or something different altogether? And whether that might have -- whether there might be potential for that to be developed into an IBD assay in the future for clinical applications? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for the question. So again, to remind everyone, the approach that Illumina has is quite unique. It's a whole genome-based MRD assay. It is initially a tumor-informed assay, but it does have the potential with more data and behind it to at some point, move into a tumor naive, right? In terms of being capable of being IBD, of course, as you know, we have invested very heavily in platforms and technologies and infrastructure that allow us to move assays to BIBD when the time is right, right? So right now, the agreement we have with pharma has been mainly to explore this in various forms. But we can go move into IBD when the time is right.\nJoydeep Goswami: Let me also add that we have no intention of providing that through a clear lab -- commercial clear lab. We do have our clear lab that, of course, is running very few samples, but we're not going out and commercialize it through our clear lab. In fact, we're very interested to work with customers and partners to continue to develop this.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Joydeep, maybe a quick one for you and the follow-up would be probably more for Jacob. But just on the gross margin piece, can you talk about 4Q step down a little bit, came in a little light of where we were. Can you just talk about anything that impacted that in 4Q, the right way to think about the progression there throughout '24? And then on the gross margin kind of pricing initiatives, Jacob, how are you thinking about just the price side? Again, I know someone mentioned AGBT competitors are making noise, kind of saying they're seeing discounting in the market, particularly on kind of the mid throughput side. So just curious as you've taken a look here, what you're thinking about on the pricing side? Thanks guys.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So Patrick, in terms of sequential decrease in fourth quarter on gross margin, there are several factors there, right? One, revenue was lower. So that has an impact, obviously, in terms of just absorption of fixed costs. We also did have a higher-than-expected X contribution. And that, coupled with more of the partnership revenue, which tends to be lower margin driven, all affected our gross margin numbers. And then lastly, I will say there was a mix shift from 6K consumables to X consumables, and that also had an impact in our overall gross margin number for Q4. I will say, and I think it leads into your question to Jacob. We have made a lot of progress in 2023 in terms of COGS productivity and we started seeing the benefits of that as we rolled out of 2023 and into 2024 as well and beyond.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. If I -- when I'm coming into the company here, Patrick, and looking into pricing and how we are thinking about pricing going forward. First, I will say that Illumina is presenting a premium product and thereby, I think also our customers are seeing that we can command premium pricing in the industry. But I think more importantly is that only talking about cost per gigabase is probably too simplistic for most of our customers. They are more interested in the cost for the whole for sample to insight for the whole workflows. And that is, of course, including sample automation, but probably even more importantly, informatics, which is also a key cost driver for our customers. So really with the Dragon platform and what we have in our comprehensive informatics offering, we actually can provide the customer be a very cost-attractive solution. So therefore, the thing about just talking cost per gigabase is kind of the -- maybe the old way of looking at it in the future way we look at a little more comprehensive. So I feel really good about that. where we are. And that said, we will now with -- in the mid throughput with the XLEAP-SBS chemistry be available. We are we are coming out with a more attractive pricing, quality and more capacity on our 1K and 2K instrument. So I'm really excited about that and again, driving elasticity based on that new price point. So you will see us really move the nuts on many more elements than just one pricing element.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research.\nEve Burstein: Hi, there. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I want to ask about next seat placement. So there, you ended the year with 885 placements, and that's comfortably above where you were pre pandemic, but it's also below where you've been for the last two years. So how much of this do you attribute to just changing needs, obviously, post-pandemic, how much do you attribute to the capital purchase and cash flow constraints that you talked about? And how much do you attribute to competitive dynamics, which you also talked about? And then how should we think about what normalized demand here looks like going forward?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So I think the major factors I would put two, maybe three, right? And then there's a sub factor. So -- the major factors, as you rightly pointed out, coming out of COVID in '21 and '22, we had a real uptick in the amount of mid-throughput instruments and low-throughput instrument sales, right? And that has normalized a little bit as the COVID threat frankly has reduced. We also, at the same time, did see in 2023 some of the macroeconomic conditions that led to more conservatism at our customers and more convergence in the purchases on capital come through. The third factor in mid throughput especially was also China, right? So if you're looking at an overall number, we did get impacted in China for competition and for macroeconomic reasons as we have repeatedly stated in our 2023 earnings calls. As far as competition goes, I mean, clearly, that was a factor in China, but that does not seem to be a huge factor in the rest of the world, right? And we did see our -- we track our competitive win rates fairly closely, and we did see that stabilize in Q3 and in Q4.\nOperator: And moving on to Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for the question, guys. On the X pull-through, we were coming up around $1 million in the fourth quarter and some quick math. We arrived at something like maybe $850,000 in 2024. So any comment on those numbers that they seem reasonable? And if so, could you just speak to like what would drive the assumption for that kind of sequential step down? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: So thanks, Dan. And I think you've done more math than that than we have at this point since it's still way too early in -- way early innings here to start to look at pull-through from the X. So we haven't really done that math as of yet. And we will provide that math when we think we are more in a stable situation where it makes sense. Any other comments on that, Joydeep?\nJoydeep Goswami: No. I think I'll reiterate, look, it is early. I think Jacob stated earlier that many customers are just going through validation, especially on the 25B. So I will disagree with them that we haven't done the math, but the math is not relevant, and we don't want to confuse you. When this stabilizes, right, we will absolutely come out with a number. But so far, what we have seen has been encouraging to us.\nOperator: And we have a question from Dan Leonard with UBS.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. Jacob, I'm curious if you could elaborate further on the health of your diagnostics markets following your customer listening tour. And with looming FDA regulation of LDTs, how does that impact demand for your products or not?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. No, I think that's a good question, something also. I really was eager to understand better coming into Illumina. As you know, I have a background in IBD and I have a lot of passion for cancer diagnostic, but really fighting cancer. And I think how we think about it, of course, that we serve a lot of clinical customers out there that is using the Illumina ecosystem and build companies on top of that, primarily into the LDT space. And then we have our own offerings in other LDT, but in all places also IBD on especially the TSO 500 and the NIPT and other places where -- and if you look into our TSO 500 business, it's been growing really fast over the last period of time. And it's more than $100 million now, and we expect to have a high double-digit growth also into this year, and we don't see any end to that right now. So I'm really bullish around where we can bring that. And we are, of course, looking into a strategic review right now on how does that fit into the overall core business strategy. But clearly, we would also like to play in that space going forward. It wasn't another -- was there a second part of that question?\nJoydeep Goswami: Regulation impact?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Okay. So I think the second part was the impact of the regulation. I mean, of course, we're monitoring that very, very deeply right now. And there's, of course, again, a conversation with our customers and be helping some customers make sure they are ready for that. Our -- the larger customers can, of course, go through a single-site PMA which help them. But there's also a change maybe in the leveling of the different -- so some of the Class III products are considered being brought down to Class II products right now. It's still kind of on the table for consideration. But if that happens, that will certainly also reduce the requirement for getting through clinical trials and so on. So I think there's still a lot of moving elements. But what I can tell you is that I think Illumina is very well positioned to support the markets going forward, almost independent on where FDA is landing on this one.\nJoydeep Goswami: I'd just add, Jacob, that we are about the only company that has -- even in our REO products, ISO 13485 classification on all our instruments and most of our consumables, and we have, obviously, the path to IBD should our customers want it, right? So we're well positioned to serve whichever direction they want to go in.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.\nKyle Mikson: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just following guidance. So it seems like you probably had the opportunity to kind of establish an outlook that was softer than what you said in November. Could set a low bar, you kept the range, though, risks clearly remain. How much like visibility or confidence do you have? Enhance conservatism are you kind of baking in compared to prior years? And you listed some of what are the most material swing factors and kind of risks that we should consider in 1Q and then first half versus second-half? And if I could just ask one for you, Joydeep, on 6000 pull-through. The $700,000, $800,000 seems like possibly aggressive compared to how HiSeq kind of decline in its years, post the 2000 launch. So just kind of walk through what you're thinking about in terms of the decline, I guess, or deterioration in 6000 pull-through? Thanks.\nJoydeep Goswami: Let me address the 6000 piece first, maybe an easier one, right? So remember when HiSeq was -- well, NovaSeq 6000 was introduced. We didn't have as many clinical customers, right? So now we have clinical about 50% of our Conn's revenue is coming from clinical customers who have these validated assays, right, where you're not going to change platforms in the short term. So the overall reduction in pull-through will be more mitigated compared to what you saw with HiSeq. Jacob, do you want to comment on the overall guidance or you want to me too?\nJacob Thaysen: You can continue.\nJoydeep Goswami: So I think overall, look, we have repeatedly said, right, we see this as a prudent approach to the overall forecast, right? And while there have been some signs in some markets that the macroeconomic conditions might be turning, we have not assumed this in our forecast. And the only place we have been pessimistic and of course, has been in China, right, where the recent news also seems to corroborate that piece. As far as the puts and takes, look, it's a lot about adoption of the X, right. So we're spending an ordinate amount of time making sure that our X customers can transition quickly, can adopt and get on with their assays as quickly as possible. And we will continue to do that. And of course, if the if the markets pick up, we are very well positioned then to benefit from any of the upside. On the flip side, it's further macroeconomic headwinds that further reduce our customers' ability to bring on the X or to spend on consumables will affect us as well. Jacob, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add.\nJacob Thaysen: I think we are good.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsda with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsda: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow-up to your answer on Patrick's question earlier. You mentioned that the gross margin line in 4Q was lighter due to that consumables mix shift from 6000 to X. So can you just walk us through that dynamic a little bit more? Is this just a function of the Xs ramping, so there's less volume leverage at this point? Or is there something where as consumables are structurally lower margins? And then how should we think about that consumables mix impacting gross margin throughout '24 as well?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So first, easy part is, no, we have said right all through, right, that we had designed the X and X consumables that at scale, right, they would -- we would expect the margins to be comparable to X consumables at scale. What you're seeing is, of course, early on in the adoption, you're going to see the consumables margins to be lower. We haven't fully scaled up. And as we move through '24, you will see that more or less normalized. Now as you go into '24, overall gross margins will be -- have several factors, right? So one, -- we will have a little bit of a benefit from the lower placement of instruments as you -- we've said right that we do expect that to declines a little bit more consumables that will lead to an increase in gross margin. We also will benefit from some uptick in terms of all the actions we have taken to improve COGS productivity. So those are the two largest things that will serve to improve our gross margins as we get to '24.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024, I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and in the supplementary data available on our website. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant-currency basis. Consolidated revenue was flat from the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's. Non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations, driven by higher revenue and gross margin and lower operating expense for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 55.4% for the quarter and 41.8% for full year 2023, compared to 29.3% in Q4 2022 and 26% for full year 2022. Although both periods reflect the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The impact of our effective tax rate in 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. In addition, our non-GAAP tax-rate for both years include a meaningful impact from the consolidation of GRAIL losses. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our full year 2023 core tax rate was in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted-average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $159 million. Moving to segment results. Core Illumina fourth quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis and included an anticipated reduction of approximately 5 percentage points from two primary categories. One, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represented approximately 3 percentage points. And two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that represented approximately 2 percentage points. Despite these impacts Core Illumina revenue exceeded expectations due to stronger than projected NovaSeq X placements and uptake in X consumables with strong early demand for the 25B flow cell that launched in Q4. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was flat year-over-year. Stronger-than-expected NovaSeq X consumables purchases were largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6,000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. As customers continue to adopt the NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by COVID, Russia and China factors that I previously noted, as well as the continued impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer's purchasing behavior. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q4 2023, compared to $20 million in Q4 2022. Turning to sequencing activity. Total activity on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 46% year-over-year in the quarter. Following the 29% year-over-year growth we reported in Q3. Sequentially, Q4 sequencing activity grew 13% from Q3. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina, of $161 million grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid and low throughput shipments due to capital purchase and cash-flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, as well as local competition in China. For NovaSeq X, we exited Q4 were 390 orders since launch. Our shipments of 79 NovaSeq X instruments in Q4 brought our total installed-base to 352 instruments. While we expect most of our NovaSeq 6000 customers to transition to the NovaSeq X over time, we're still very early in this transition. As of the end of 2023, our net installed base for NovaSeq 6000 was approximately 1,770 instruments, which reflects approximately 110 instruments that have been deactivated, between 2017 and 2023. The majority of these were in 2023, due to customer transitions to NovaSeq X. We expect this to increase in 2024 as customers continue to ramp up utilization of NovaSeq X. Additionally, going forward, we will be reporting our annual instrument installed base figures on a net basis, which accounts for instruments that have been decommissioned or inactivated since launch. The information included on this slide includes additional details to help you with your modeling. We will be posting this presentation to our Investor Relations website following our prepared remarks. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $152 million was up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7% for the quarter decreased 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the mix of lower-margin strategic partnership revenue, lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction and increased field services and installation costs, partially offset by lower freight costs. Core Illumina, non-GAAP operating expenses of $507 million were down $21 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based stock-compensation expense year-over-year. As a result of these factors and higher revenue, Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5% in Q4 2023 compared to 17.8% in Q4 2022. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $30 million for the quarter grew 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $167 million and increased $1 million year-over-year. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $224 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million and free-cash flow was $173 million. We did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.05 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. As Illumina continues to move as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL, given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment, the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on Core Illumina. Our guidance does not assume any impact for the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. Upon the completion of the divestment, we will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2024. As Jacob mentioned, our outlook assumes the current challenging macroeconomic environment persist in 2024 and tighter funding and budget pressures continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions. We expect full-year 2024 core revenue to be approximately flat from 2023, reflecting the following offsetting factors. We expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline in the high-teens year-over-year, driven primarily by a decrease in NovaSeq X instrument placements. The reduction reflects the expected transition in our adoption curve, the early majority, customers from early adopters and the lower backlog entering 2024, compared to 2023. We also expect capital and cash flow constraints to continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements in 2024. We expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to grow in the low-single digits year-over-year, driven primarily by modest growth in high-throughput consumables as increased NovaSeq X consumables purchases and sequencing volume outpaced the expected decline in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. Moving to annual pull through. Going forward, we will be calculating and providing pull-through figures based on the instruments' net installed base. As I mentioned previously, supplemental information is included in our earnings presentation. To help with modeling, which will be posted to our Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks. Importantly, this does not change reported revenue in any way. We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 approximately $700,000 to $800,000 per system in 2024 as customers continue to transition sequencing volume to NovaSeq X. We expect annual pull-through for NextSeq 1k/2k in the range of $80,000 to $130,000 per system in 2024, which primarily reflects the impact of customers transitioning to XLEAP chemistry as it becomes available on NextSeq 1k/2k. We expect annual pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance. We expect Core Illumina total sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations reflect the benefit of our continued gross margin improvement and expense reduction initiatives, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation, as well as the impacts from inflation and market-based merit increases. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.03 million to $1.04 billion, reflecting a Year-over-Year decrease of 3.5% to 4.5%, driven predominantly by the following factors. We expect lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments year-over-year given that we are entering 2024 with a more modest backlog, compared to the significant pre-order book. We entered 2023, following the launch of NovaSeq X. We expect the increase in NovaSeq X consumables purchases year-over-year to be largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. Consistent with the trend we saw in Q4. We expect an increase in sequencing service and other revenue year-over-year, driven by strategic partnership initiatives and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. For the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, for the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP net other expense of approximately $12 million, with the year-over-year increase driven primarily by lower interest income on our lower cash balance following the repayment of our convertible notes in mid-2023. I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. Yes. And just maybe one quick add right about 40% of our X customers so far have adopted the 25B. Yes. And to address your question about the low-single-digits consumables growth, Puneet. So, let me start by saying we were very encouraged by the uptake of the 25B and 10B flow cells that we saw in the fourth quarter. We're also very pleased to see the elasticity, the growth in underlying sequencing activity being driven by ex-customers, right? So both of those are good. We saw that uptick on sequencing activity now for the second quarter in a row. So again, it's broad-based. It's both research and clinical customers. And it's quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth. So what's offsetting that expected growth in X consumables, as you rightly pointed out, is the expected price transition as customers move from the NovaSeq 6000 to the X. This is very similar to the price transition that you saw when you were moving from HiSeq to NovaSeq 6000. And then, of course, some of the expected again, reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers switch from one platform to the other, right? So those -- that is the really big piece on the -- what's leading to the lower or the low-single-digit growth rate in consumables in 2024. Okay And then. Vijay I want to be sure you're asking about NovaSeq 6,000 pull-through numbers and how they modulate through the year? No, there isn't. I think, again, pull-through will reemphasize as a calculated number. So it's more of the total amount of consumables sold in any quarter divided by the number of now the active installed base in the quarter, right? So -- and we don't have an assumption in terms of quarterly spread on that. Just to add, Subha, I think we have made reductions in R&D over the last year. It's been very strategic in terms of specific aspects of the portfolio that we had considered as longer -- much longer time of payoffs or more risky. And we have also -- our overall R&D includes spend in certain areas like medical affairs, et cetera, that we were doing to support customers. And as they have matured, right, we have been able to pull back on investment there without affecting innovation. Yes. I'd just add, we weren't expecting to see that before the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So really, you're in very early innings there, and we do expect to see those fleet expansions come in, in this year. Let me also add that we have no intention of providing that through a clear lab -- commercial clear lab. We do have our clear lab that, of course, is running very few samples, but we're not going out and commercialize it through our clear lab. In fact, we're very interested to work with customers and partners to continue to develop this. Yes. So Patrick, in terms of sequential decrease in fourth quarter on gross margin, there are several factors there, right? One, revenue was lower. So that has an impact, obviously, in terms of just absorption of fixed costs. We also did have a higher-than-expected X contribution. And that, coupled with more of the partnership revenue, which tends to be lower margin driven, all affected our gross margin numbers. And then lastly, I will say there was a mix shift from 6K consumables to X consumables, and that also had an impact in our overall gross margin number for Q4. I will say, and I think it leads into your question to Jacob. We have made a lot of progress in 2023 in terms of COGS productivity and we started seeing the benefits of that as we rolled out of 2023 and into 2024 as well and beyond. Yes. So I think the major factors I would put two, maybe three, right? And then there's a sub factor. So -- the major factors, as you rightly pointed out, coming out of COVID in '21 and '22, we had a real uptick in the amount of mid-throughput instruments and low-throughput instrument sales, right? And that has normalized a little bit as the COVID threat frankly has reduced. We also, at the same time, did see in 2023 some of the macroeconomic conditions that led to more conservatism at our customers and more convergence in the purchases on capital come through. The third factor in mid throughput especially was also China, right? So if you're looking at an overall number, we did get impacted in China for competition and for macroeconomic reasons as we have repeatedly stated in our 2023 earnings calls. As far as competition goes, I mean, clearly, that was a factor in China, but that does not seem to be a huge factor in the rest of the world, right? And we did see our -- we track our competitive win rates fairly closely, and we did see that stabilize in Q3 and in Q4. No. I think I'll reiterate, look, it is early. I think Jacob stated earlier that many customers are just going through validation, especially on the 25B. So I will disagree with them that we haven't done the math, but the math is not relevant, and we don't want to confuse you. When this stabilizes, right, we will absolutely come out with a number. But so far, what we have seen has been encouraging to us. Regulation impact? I'd just add, Jacob, that we are about the only company that has -- even in our REO products, ISO 13485 classification on all our instruments and most of our consumables, and we have, obviously, the path to IBD should our customers want it, right? So we're well positioned to serve whichever direction they want to go in. Let me address the 6000 piece first, maybe an easier one, right? So remember when HiSeq was -- well, NovaSeq 6000 was introduced. We didn't have as many clinical customers, right? So now we have clinical about 50% of our Conn's revenue is coming from clinical customers who have these validated assays, right, where you're not going to change platforms in the short term. So the overall reduction in pull-through will be more mitigated compared to what you saw with HiSeq. Jacob, do you want to comment on the overall guidance or you want to me too? So I think overall, look, we have repeatedly said, right, we see this as a prudent approach to the overall forecast, right? And while there have been some signs in some markets that the macroeconomic conditions might be turning, we have not assumed this in our forecast. And the only place we have been pessimistic and of course, has been in China, right, where the recent news also seems to corroborate that piece. As far as the puts and takes, look, it's a lot about adoption of the X, right. So we're spending an ordinate amount of time making sure that our X customers can transition quickly, can adopt and get on with their assays as quickly as possible. And we will continue to do that. And of course, if the if the markets pick up, we are very well positioned then to benefit from any of the upside. On the flip side, it's further macroeconomic headwinds that further reduce our customers' ability to bring on the X or to spend on consumables will affect us as well. Jacob, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add. Yes. So first, easy part is, no, we have said right all through, right, that we had designed the X and X consumables that at scale, right, they would -- we would expect the margins to be comparable to X consumables at scale. What you're seeing is, of course, early on in the adoption, you're going to see the consumables margins to be lower. We haven't fully scaled up. And as we move through '24, you will see that more or less normalized. Now as you go into '24, overall gross margins will be -- have several factors, right? So one, -- we will have a little bit of a benefit from the lower placement of instruments as you -- we've said right that we do expect that to declines a little bit more consumables that will lead to an increase in gross margin. We also will benefit from some uptick in terms of all the actions we have taken to improve COGS productivity. So those are the two largest things that will serve to improve our gross margins as we get to '24."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I joined Illumina as CEO a little over four months ago. In this time, part of my focus has been on meeting with customers to understand their priorities, hear their feedback and develop more collaborative relationships. Our customer thinks highly of Illumina and our solutions. And they want to work-in strategic partnerships with us to move the whole MTS ecosystem forward. Now that we have announced that we will divest GRAIL, it has been easier for our customers to plan what the future looks like with Illumina. These meetings have been instructive and inspiring. During my recent trip to Europe, I was able to see first-hand how we're working with our customers, governments and the broader genomics community to accelerate whole-genome sequencing adoption safely and more effectively and to understand rare diseases in cancers as a part of the standard-of-care. I've also learned about Germany's modern project that aims to fully integrate comprehensive genomic testing into the healthcare system there beginning in Q2 this year. Within the hallways of our headquarters and several global offices I have also been connecting with our talented employees, who are committed to driving innovation and continuing to build outer genomics ecosystem. I've also had an opportunity to engage with many of you at recent investor conferences. These conversations are informing my leadership agenda and importantly have reinforced my confidence in Illumina's core business. 2023 was a dynamic year for Illumina. NovaSeq X has been the most successful high-throughput product launch in our history. We ended the year with 352 NovaSeq X shipments above the 330 to 340 we expected. Amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop that we saw many of our customers remaining constrained in their purchasing decisions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered higher-than-expected consolidated revenue of approximately $1.12 billion. Americas' revenue, which is more than half of our business was flat year-on-year. Europe revenue was up 17% year-on-year on a relatively easy prior year comparable. EMEA revenue declined 1%, although that included a 10 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. Greater China revenue was down 13% year-over-year, reflecting continued geopolitical challenges and local competition and mid-throughput. As I've noted before, China and our customers there are important to Illumina. We've already taken certain pricing and other strategic actions that are beginning to yield results. We will share more specifics on our progress there over time. Globally, we expect our customers will remain cautious. And for now, we continue to expect 2024 results to look very similar to 2023. While some macro headlines are encouraging, we haven't yet seen that translate to increased investment in our industry and therefore have not reflected in our guidance. Joydeep will take you through more details in our guidance in a few minutes. While we cannot control the external environment, the management team and I remain committed to accelerating value creations across the enterprise. As you are aware, I've laid out three key priorities that I believe will position Illumina for accelerated growth and profitability as market conditions improve. My first priority, driving our top line is centered on continuing to grow our installed base and helping customers accelerate utilization of these instruments in new and existing applications. I discussed earlier, how pleased we are with the first year of NovaSeq X shipments. The high throughput more broadly across the NovaSeq X and NovaSeq 6000, we placed more than 400 instruments in 2023. In 2024, we will support this growing installed base as customers launched large projects and more sequencing intensive applications like multiomics liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease or MRD. We anticipate ongoing high throughput instrument orders throughout 2024, primarily coming from further conversion of NovaSeq 6000 customers to the X from customer fleet expansion and long-term from new to high throughput customers. So, that said, given the significant number of placements in 2023, we believe we will ultimately ship fewer high throughput instruments in 2024. As you aware, XLEAP-SBS chemistry has been the engine for our X platform, delivering significant improvements in quality, turnaround time and cost. This quarter, we'll be making XLEAP available to our mid-throughput customers. On the existing NextSeq 1k/2k instruments without having to upgrade their instruments. This offering will further strengthen our leadership position around the world and drive progress in markets such as single cell, spatial and proteomics. As we grow installed base, we'll remain focused on supporting our customers as they launched new projects. This will build momentum for consumables demand this year and going forward. Already our efforts to develop this demand is paying off. In Q4, we saw higher-than-expected growth in X consumables sales following the late October, launch of our much anticipated 25B reagent kit. More recently in January, we launched a 1.5B kit, which together with the 25B and 10B flow cells allows us to offer a full suite of products to the NovaSeq X customers. While we will continue to see customers reduce their inventories of NovaSeq 6000 consumables as they transition to the X building pull-through on the NovaSeq X will drive our overall high-throughput consumables growth this year. Turning to my second priority. I'm focused on delivering operational excellence, by applying greater rigor throughout our P&L while sustaining innovation and growth. We've launched and multi-year effort, focusing on improving our margins through greater productivity and pursuing additional areas for cost-savings. In January, we took an additional action to further optimize our global workforce. Over the past year, we've made cumulative role reductions totaling approximately 12%. Our most recent actions included adjustment that we aligned with our late 2023, portfolio optimization efforts. You'll see us continue to take steps to not only manage our near-term cost, but also to build our agility to deliver more sustained growth and margins over time. Illumina is taking a highly disciplined approach to support our customers, employees and partners and to deliver shareholder returns. Throughout a range of macroeconomic environments. Moving to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quick as possible. Since joining Illumina, I've made an imperative to move with speed on GRAIL. In December, we announced that we would divest GRAIL, with a goal of finalizing the terms of the transactions by the end-of-the second-quarter this year. We'll continue to pursue parallel paths. The divestiture will be executed through a third-party sale or capital markets transaction, consistent with the European Commission divestiture order. To-date, we've been able to make swift progress GRAIL, From 10 has been confidentially filed with the SEC. Our advisors are actively moving the process forward on both sale and capital market path. The special committee of the Board, that we established in Q3 continues to help ensure this process move forward efficiently. I'm encouraged by the momentum we've entered 2024 with and I'm committed to seeing our initiative through for now I will ask Joydeep to share more detail on our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. Thanks, Joydeep. Before we close and move to Q&A, I want to discuss what I believe success looks like, both this year and the years ahead. Illumina has the opportunity to truly drive the next-generation sequencing ecosystem forward. We will deepen our relationships with our customers and seek out greater ways to collaborate and partner with them to drive greater adoption of NGS. Our goal is to make our customers the heroes in their labs. And to support them as they expand their work in genomics and multiomics. In turn, this will help capitalize our market-leading innovation and continue to differentiate Illumina and maintain our industry-leading position across research and clinical markets. We will also continue to drive innovation that is focused on our customers' priorities. This includes evolving our sequencing platform and delivering greater sample to answer solutions. There is an opportunity to further integrate customers' workflow to build our share of wallet as we create greater value for our customers. Our comprehensive strategy work is well underway, and we will share more with you later this year. I'm excited to be part of Illumina's leadership team that is driving our unmatched core business forward. Thank you for joining. I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thanks, Doug. And, no, that was nice one question there. So let me start by saying that we've been very pleased with the pickup of the 25B since the launch in late November. In fact, it's did kind of performed all our expectations and have been very received with their customers. So we continue to expect that this will continue to really drive X performance, but also, of course, it's completely now unleashed the full performance of the instrument, and thereby, we also expect that the 25B -- the availability of the 25B will have more customers to jump on to the X wagon here. I think we are seeing customers being able to load it. Of course, many of them are still doing validation work, but we are seeing that they have a big enough projects to load the closeout. All right. Thanks for that, Puneet. And let me start by the latter part of this question about GRAIL, and then I'll have Joydeep chime in on our expectations here on consumables growth. But as I mentioned, you know, we are very pleased with the announcement that we made here in December that we are now divesting GRAIL for sure and I'm actually very pleased with the progress so far. We have our advisers really moving ahead and now in connection and in conversations with rural parties. We are continuing to run a dual track, of course, can be a capital markets initiative or it can be a transaction. And so we still expect to be on track with the timeline we were previously talking about that we would have all the terms finalized by end of June. So we are -- at this point, we are not talking about -- since we are expecting to finish up with GRAIL this year, we're not having any guidance on the expenditure for GRAIL this year. Yes. Yes, so let's start with the GRAIL question. And obviously, we'd like to provide as much information to all of you as possible. Right now, as you say, the filing is confidential. And I don't think it will be public available before very late in Q1 maybe dipping into Q2 here. So I think that's where we are at this. But as soon as it's available, we'll make sure you know. Yes. Of course, it's a relevant hypothesis to come in with. What we have seen is that most of our clinical customers are using the opportunity with the lower cost of X to actually expand the depth of sequencing providing bigger panels and so on. So what we're seeing is that most of the current panels continue to run on the NovaSeq 6000 and thereby continue to also drive volume there. And then they are right now validating many of the new assays or the new assays that might not have been possible in the 6000 to trust and so on to be on the X. So we're quite encouraged about that. We've also seen several of our specialty labs customer now order tens of NovaSeq X. So I'm encouraged that we will see a lot of volume here going forward on this. Yes, thank you. You're right that we continue to believe that there's a lot of innovation that is required there by investment into R&D in order to drive the whole NGS ecosystem forward. We -- as I said, one of the things -- what I said previously, is one of the things that I was really excited about is the pipeline of innovation that we have in running right now and thereby, also there will be a lot of innovation coming out from Illumina over the next period of time here. And we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of the whole opportunities here in NDS, but even also multiomics and thereby, we continue to make investment into that. You're also right that there has been an increase in R&D, and we're certainly looking to change that trajectory over time. We still believe that a high level of investment is required, but you will see here over the next years that the percentage spending R&D versus revenue will start to come down. Yes, I think, I mean, we certainly see a lot of our high-end customers, the high-volume customers that started buying one or two NovaSeq X is starting to consider purchasing more instruments. So they're using the first few X to validate assays on. And then they want to expand into to -- use the additional Xs to actually run in production, but very few customers have still gone into production mode. And thereby, there is a real big opportunity in front of us. I think that less than half of our high-volume customers have purchased X so far. So I think there's still a lot of opportunities there. But I've also mentioned some of the high-volume customers that have purchased one or two have now put orders in for 10 instruments. So I think we're still in the very early stages, and there should be a lot of opportunities here, both in '24 and '25 to drive more placements. Yes. Thanks, Dave. And of course, we're tracking, of course, everything that is happening out in the market and we take our competition very seriously. But I think you've also heard me on the multiomics place. I think you've heard me speak multiple times about multiomics. So we have an intention also to be in that space. I think we were not talking about moving forward as a starting point with proteomics here with our relationships with Stemologic. But I think you can see that -- actually, we believe there is many more modalities that can be available on the instrument. So I think the -- where we -- where Illumina is doing is that we will go out and provide that insight when we're ready to put something in the market and speak less about it when it's more in the future. Secondly, we feel with the NovaSeq X where we come out with a very attractive price point for a lot of different applications and not only a very few ones. So I think we feel that we have a very attractive solution. But I also remind you that it's not only the cost per sequencing -- that anymore, that is relevant, but also you need to look at the whole cost of the whole workflow, how many manual steps you have, how much waste you are, instrument spending and so on. So I think if you dig into the details, you will actually realize that Illumina has a very attractive and very differentiated platform. Yes. So the tax rate, again, is something that should be -- you should expect to be relatively constant as you go into -- and again, for core Illumina into 2024. And this is, again, core Illumina, right? We are not giving guidance this year yet on the consolidated number. In terms of the operating margin cadence, again, that is typically that does go up as the gross margins tend to go up as we move into greater volume through the year. In terms of operating margin, you will see a decrease in potentially in Q2 as the merit and the other inflation-related aspects come into play. But then you will see after that, a quarter-on-quarter increase as we move into the rest of the year. And then, of course, I think on the -- sorry, just one other thing, right? I know there's been some movement in terms of the R&D capitalization piece, but that is something we're monitoring very carefully. It is past the house, but it still needs to get through the Senate and the President signing. If we get that, you can expect a further improvement in the tax rate, right? But we are not building that into our assumptions at this point. Yes. Thanks for the question. So again, to remind everyone, the approach that Illumina has is quite unique. It's a whole genome-based MRD assay. It is initially a tumor-informed assay, but it does have the potential with more data and behind it to at some point, move into a tumor naive, right? In terms of being capable of being IBD, of course, as you know, we have invested very heavily in platforms and technologies and infrastructure that allow us to move assays to BIBD when the time is right, right? So right now, the agreement we have with pharma has been mainly to explore this in various forms. But we can go move into IBD when the time is right. Yes. If I -- when I'm coming into the company here, Patrick, and looking into pricing and how we are thinking about pricing going forward. First, I will say that Illumina is presenting a premium product and thereby, I think also our customers are seeing that we can command premium pricing in the industry. But I think more importantly is that only talking about cost per gigabase is probably too simplistic for most of our customers. They are more interested in the cost for the whole for sample to insight for the whole workflows. And that is, of course, including sample automation, but probably even more importantly, informatics, which is also a key cost driver for our customers. So really with the Dragon platform and what we have in our comprehensive informatics offering, we actually can provide the customer be a very cost-attractive solution. So therefore, the thing about just talking cost per gigabase is kind of the -- maybe the old way of looking at it in the future way we look at a little more comprehensive. So I feel really good about that. where we are. And that said, we will now with -- in the mid throughput with the XLEAP-SBS chemistry be available. We are we are coming out with a more attractive pricing, quality and more capacity on our 1K and 2K instrument. So I'm really excited about that and again, driving elasticity based on that new price point. So you will see us really move the nuts on many more elements than just one pricing element. So thanks, Dan. And I think you've done more math than that than we have at this point since it's still way too early in -- way early innings here to start to look at pull-through from the X. So we haven't really done that math as of yet. And we will provide that math when we think we are more in a stable situation where it makes sense. Any other comments on that, Joydeep? Yes. No, I think that's a good question, something also. I really was eager to understand better coming into Illumina. As you know, I have a background in IBD and I have a lot of passion for cancer diagnostic, but really fighting cancer. And I think how we think about it, of course, that we serve a lot of clinical customers out there that is using the Illumina ecosystem and build companies on top of that, primarily into the LDT space. And then we have our own offerings in other LDT, but in all places also IBD on especially the TSO 500 and the NIPT and other places where -- and if you look into our TSO 500 business, it's been growing really fast over the last period of time. And it's more than $100 million now, and we expect to have a high double-digit growth also into this year, and we don't see any end to that right now. So I'm really bullish around where we can bring that. And we are, of course, looking into a strategic review right now on how does that fit into the overall core business strategy. But clearly, we would also like to play in that space going forward. It wasn't another -- was there a second part of that question? Yes. Okay. So I think the second part was the impact of the regulation. I mean, of course, we're monitoring that very, very deeply right now. And there's, of course, again, a conversation with our customers and be helping some customers make sure they are ready for that. Our -- the larger customers can, of course, go through a single-site PMA which help them. But there's also a change maybe in the leveling of the different -- so some of the Class III products are considered being brought down to Class II products right now. It's still kind of on the table for consideration. But if that happens, that will certainly also reduce the requirement for getting through clinical trials and so on. So I think there's still a lot of moving elements. But what I can tell you is that I think Illumina is very well positioned to support the markets going forward, almost independent on where FDA is landing on this one. You can continue. I think we are good."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Salli Schwartz, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nSalli Schwartz: Hello, everyone and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2023. During the call today, we will review the financial results we released after the close of the market, and offer commentary on our commercial and regulatory activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session. Our earnings release can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at Illumina.com. Participating for Illumina today will be Jacob Thaysen, Chief Executive Officer and Joydeep Goswami, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Jacob will provide an update on the state of Illumina's business and Joydeep will review our financial results, which include GRAIL. As a reminder GRAIL must be held and operated separately and independently from Illumina pursuant to the transitional measures ordered by the European Commission, which prohibited our acquisition of GRAIL under the EU merger regulation. This call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the Investor section of our website. It is our intent that all forward-looking statements regarding our financial results and commercial activity made during today's call will be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

To better understand the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, we refer you to the documents that Illumina files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Illumina's most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: Thank you, Sally. Good day everyone and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role as Illumina's CEO a little over six weeks ago. It is an honor to lead this company. I joined Illumina after more than a decade at Agilent, where I ran both the Diagnostic and Genomics Group, and more recently, Agilent's largest business, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group. I have long admired Illumina for its role in building the genomics market, and I'm incredibly excited to be here. During my first weeks, I prioritized getting to know our employees and meeting with several of our customers. Illumina has a highly capable team, and I have been impressed with their level of passion and commitment to our work. Both our employees and our customers are driven to move genomics forward. Like our team, I'm passionate about genomics and the role that this field can play in healthcare and personalized medicine, particularly in the oncology space. This is a massive opportunity, and Illumina will remain the key player, even as others enter the market. Illumina's infrastructure that we have built over two and a half decades, our compelling offerings that set the global standard, and our deep commitment to innovation for the future will continue to drive the use of genomics and multiomics around the world. Turning to our third quarter results; in Q3, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.12 billion, flat year-over-year, or up 1% on a constant currency basis. This was a disappointing result. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging for our industry and for our customers, with customers increasingly cautious and constrained in their purchasing decisions. Despite a lower gross margin year-over-year, tight management of our operating expenses allowed us to deliver diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, also approximately flat year-over-year. While we cannot control external environment, Illumina's management team and I remain focused on supporting our customers and our own operational execution. Part of my comprehensive review of the business includes reexamining our strategic initiatives and our targets for long-term revenue growth and operating margins. We will lay out our new targets for you later next year. A key priority for me is to get clarity on the GRAIL situation. Therefore, I have requested and the Board has established a special committee to expedite decisions on GRAIL. Furthermore, we have retained advices and are preparing for sale and capital markets transactions. We expect to file a Form-10 on a confidential basis with the SEC. Hereafter, we will contact third parties as investment capital sources or as potential purchasers as our appeals are ongoing. I know there have been questions regarding our appeals. These appeals are not just about GRAIL. They provide Illumina with flexibility for any divestiture of GRAIL and also for future transactions. The appeals will not impact our ability to move swiftly. Make no mistake, I'm here to focus on the core business, which I will talk more about after Joydeep's remarks. Joydeep?\nJoydeep Goswami: Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and in the supplementary data available on our website. As Jacob noted, in the third quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was flat year-over-year and up 1% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue was down 5% from the second quarter of 2023. Although we correctly anticipated a sequential decrease in high-throughput consumables revenue due to the NovaSeq X transition, we placed fewer NovaSeq X instruments than we expected in the quarter, as customers' purchase constraints led to lengthened sales cycles. Non-GAAP net income was $52 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $155 million for the quarter. Despite our lower revenue, non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense reduction initiatives and a higher gross margin than we forecast. GAAP net loss was $754 million, or $4.77 per diluted share, which included goodwill and intangible impairments of $821 million related to the GRAIL segment. These impairments were primarily the result of a decrease in Illumina's consolidated market capitalization and a higher discount rate used for the fair value cancellation of the GRAIL segment. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 39.7% for the quarter, which decreased from 43.2% in Q3 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the non-GAAP tax expense, impact of R&D capitalization requirements, given increased amortization of capitalized R&D expenses. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results; Core Illumina revenue of $1.11 billion was flat year-over-year on both the reported and constant currency basis, and included anticipated reductions of approximately seven percentage points from two primary categories. One, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represent approximately 3.5 percentage points and two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that also is approximately 3.5 percentage points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q3 2023, compared to $28 million in Q3 2022. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was down 4% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by a 12% decline in sales research customers. These customers were impacted by the NovaSeq X transition and are reducing NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by the COVID, Russia and China factors I noted previously, as well as the impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer's purchasing power and project planning. Strength in sales to clinical customers partially offset the decline in research, with clinical sequencing consumables growing 10% year-over-year, led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing. Turning to sequencing activity, total sequencing gigabase output on connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 5% from Q2 2023 and 29% year-over-year. We are encouraged by the trends we're seeing across both research and clinical high-throughput customers that have a NovaSeq X installed. As expected, these customers show higher overall growth in sequencing output than high-throughput customers that have not yet adopted the NovaSeq X, both on a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $179 million grew 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid-throughput due to increasing capital purchase and cash flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally, as well as by local competition in China. For NovaSeq X, we exited Q3 with more than 310 orders since launch. Our shipments of 97 NovaSeq X instruments in Q3 brought our total installed base to 273 instruments. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $142 million was up 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, as well as an increase in lab services revenue. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina, all regions continue to be impacted by two key issues. One, tighter funding and budget pressures that are impacting customer purchasing power and project planning and two, the impact of high-throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X as customers continue to reduce NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. America's revenue of $650 million grew 10% year-over-year, attributed to NovaSeq X placements, as well as clinical testing volume driving greater consumables revenue. Clinical sequencing consumables shipments grew more than 20% year-over-year. Europe revenue of $260 million was flat year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis. Growth in sequencing consumables was driven by mid-teens growth in clinical and strength in mid-throughput consumables offset by the decline in COVID surveillance and the negative impact of exchange rates. For sequencing instruments, growth in high throughput due to NovaSeq X placements was more than offset by a decline in mid-throughput instruments. India revenue of $98 million declined 22% year-over-year or 19% on a constant currency basis, which included an 11 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. The year-over-year decrease was also driven by softness in Japan due to the macroeconomic factors I mentioned earlier as well as the expected slowdown in COVID surveillance. Greater China revenue of $98 million represented a 26% decrease year-over-year or 25% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges as well as local competition in mid-throughput. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 66% decreased 290 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix and less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes as well as lower instrument margins and higher field service and installation cost due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $481 million were down $33 million year-over-year and were lower than expected primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives. As a result of these factors, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5% in Q3 2023 compared to 22.6% in Q3 2022. Despite our lower gross margin, operating margin was approximately flat year-over-year due to our proactive cost management initiatives. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL; GRAIL revenue of $21 million for the quarter grew 110% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses total $161 million and increased $12 million year-over-year driven primarily by efforts to scale GRAIL's commercial and R&D organizations. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items; cash flow provided by operations was $139 million. Third quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $45 million and free cash flow was $94 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $933 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the third quarter of 2023, the company used $750 million in cash to repay the outstanding principle of convertible notes that matured in August 2023. Moving now to 2023 guidance; we now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to decline 2% to 3% from 2022, including Core Illumina revenue that is down 3% to 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions in Russia of approximately 100 basis points, reductions in our business in China, as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GRAIL revenue is now expected to be at the low end of the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. For fiscal 2023, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year driven by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally, as well as the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by our lower NovaSeq X shipment expectations for 2023. We now expect to ship between 330 NovaSeq X to 340 NovaSeq X instruments for the year as customers' purchasing constraints lead to lengthened sale cycles. We also now expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by the decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers transition to NovaSeq X. The impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer project planning and budgets, the effect of sanctions in Russia, the slowdown in COVID surveillance, and the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance primarily reflects a slower ramp in NovaSeq X consumables, in part due to our lower placement expectations, as well as the increasing impacts of macroeconomic constraints. We now expect Core Illumina total sequencing revenue to decline 3% to 4% year-over-year. This continues to include intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 4% to 4.5%, and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of 19% to 19.5%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year, partially offset by continued expense reduction initiatives. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 39% for 2023, due to discrete tax benefit recognized in Q3 2023 related to prior year return adjustments. Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 for 2023, reflecting non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares. Dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss is now expected to be approximately $660 million, as GRAIL continues to manage its expense base in line of its latest revenue outlook. I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate Illumina's commitment to supporting our customers in this difficult macroeconomic environment. While we cannot control for external factors, we can optimize our own actions to successfully navigate through this period and position the company for a return to accelerated growth on the other side. I know you're interested to hear our views for 2024. With the caveat that we haven't finished 2023, we're still looking at our budget for 2024. Our initial views is that 2024 results will look very similar to 2023. We don't expect near-term improvement to the macroeconomic environment, and geopolitical issues have been persistent. We are encouraged with the early signs we're seeing for NovaSeq X utilization and the continued rollout of the X position us very well for the ramp in consumables and overall growth with the market conditions improve. This is clearly a dynamic situation, and we want to be able to develop our views in depth. Therefore, for 2024, we will not provide guidance before our Q4 earnings call in February. The main reason that I joined Illumina was my strong conviction about the future of the Core Illumina business. While over the coming month, I'll continue to listen and learn, I will also be focused on several key priorities. First, we need to drive our top line as much as possible in this environment. This means continuous placements of the NovaSeq X and all of our instruments, laying the groundwork for increased consumables demand. We'll continue working closely with our customers around the world, whether they're integrating new instruments into their workflows, starting new projects, or building new tests or assays. Second, we need to keep driving innovation that is highly focused on our customers' priorities. These innovations include automation and sample-to-answer solutions, serve to strengthen our leadership position around the world. At the same time, we need to manage our R&D investments with discipline and rigor. We most recently launched our 25B Rating Kit. This was highly anticipated by our customers, and it will unleash the full power of the NovaSeq X. Third, we need to focus our own operational excellence across geographies, functions, and processes. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce our analyzed run rate expenses. Our team has executed well and has been able to reduce analyzed run rate expenses by approximately $175 million, ahead of our original projection of more than $100 million. These savings will continue to support flexibility in further investment in high-growth areas and our margins. I'm committed to executing against all of these priorities with a strong sense of urgency. We are focused on delivering tangible improvements that support profitable long-term growth for Illumina and for our shareholders. I will now invite the operator to open for the line of Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and Jacob, welcome to Illumina. My, maybe one question is on GRAIL, maybe a two-parter here. I think the EC's divestiture order asked for 2.5 years of cash outlay. What does that mean given GRAIL's current OpEx spending? Is that $1.75 billion of cash outlay? And I think related to that; I saw you announced a special committee. Who is on the special committee? What is the focus for this committee? Is there any more details? And it sounded something different, I just want to understand what is different, what has changed?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, Vijay, thank you very much and I'm really excited to be here at Illumina and let me start with your second question and then I'll have Joydeep step in also on talking about what those 2.5 years means, but as I discussed here, coming into the company, I felt it was very important to get clarity on GRAIL and it was very important for me to have the support for the board and to make swift decisions to move forward and thereby, we started a special committee with three of the board members, including, and then besides me, that is the chairing of that committee. So I have three board members and plus me that will work with the management team and to really walk through all the elements around the divestiture order to make sure we can make some fast decisions. We need to make decisions which path we're going to follow. Is it going to be a trade sale, the spin, the split, without a sponsor and of course, there's a lot of considerations related to that. That's really what the special committee is helping me and the rest of the management team to do. Joydeep.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yeah, Vijay. Hey, so on the 2.5 years of cash support or to GRAIL, we're still working with the European Commission on exactly what that means in terms of a numerical number. So I'm not at liberty to disclose those details. We will come back with that once we have alignment, but I think as Jacob alluded to, this is not something that we have to provide all on our own. We have several options now that we have worked with the EC to come out with a, or to have a divestiture order that is in line with our expectations of flexibility to use even in the case of a spin or a split decision, we can get in a sponsor that can support all or a part of the requirement for the 2.5 years of cash support or we can go to the markets and raise that money as well. So stay tuned on that one.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Hey, thanks for taking the questions here. Jacob, Welcome. Maybe just a last one, obviously, it's all we have, but maybe a couple of parter. So maybe Jacob, obviously you left a great job at Agilent before coming here and certainly we'll be interested to get your view on the growth rate and outlook from for Illumina when you're ready to give that. But to be interested to get your view on kind of the overall NGS market and taking the job, like thoughts on what type of growth characteristics you think are reasonable in that market because given the price cuts, there's just a lot of question on demand elasticity. So I guess first one is on the NGS overall market, if you had a view there and then B, I just had a question on the X specifically. I understand, obviously, as a lowering the placement number given customer constraints, but can you give any color on the orders or the backlog that you have as of right now? And then the final part would just be on guidance. Illumina's had a series of kind of guidance reductions. A lot of peers are facing the same issue, but you guys have had a more elongated period of this. I'm just wondering kind of what changes can be made in order to hopefully better set guidance so that the risk of these reductions is eliminated going forward, thanks.\nJacob Thaysen: No, thanks, Dan. And I think I would have Joydeep also jumping in on some of those elements here, but let me just start by coming here into Illumina and my observation both from when I was outside Illumina, but also coming in, I think that the core business has a tremendous opportunity. I think there's a lot of opportunities in the NGS markets and I think we are definitely through a tough period right now. I think the whole life science tools industry is seeing it and certainly here at Illumina, we're not immune for that, but the growth rates, even though I will spend time here over the next period of time still learning the business and really understand the organization. So at this point of time, I don't have a final opinion about what I think is the right growth rates for the business and what we're committing to, but I will certainly come back later in '24 and share all of that with you when I'm ready for it. But in the meantime, I think that the overall market is very healthy and there will be a lot of growth opportunities for Illumina going forward and I can then say that some of the findings coming into the company and really digging deep into our innovation engine and what our roadmaps look like. I'm very excited for the future of this company. I think we will continue to pioneer in this area. So I think on guidance and Joydeep joining here also, but in the end, we wanted to make sure when we signal also from, especially '24 here that, that at this point, we want to be prudent in how we set our, it's not a guidance yet, but at least how we view '24, as we simply don't see any change, short-term change in the economical environment and therefore we felt it was important for, to go out now and then share our observations, but Joydeep, do you want to?\nJoydeep Goswami: No, I think, I think Jacob, that's right. On the guidance piece, look, we made a commitment to you to come back to you with any read on the macroeconomics we see, and I think we're held up to that commitment. In fact, we may have been a little bit canary in the coal mine signaling some of this earlier to you, especially this year than others, right? One of the things, of course, you did bring up with the elongated, sort of lack of growth or the reduced growth that we have had. That is true. I think, part of what hit us at the same time as the macroeconomics going down is the transition, major transition on our platform, which has hit us as customers move from the 6,000 to the X, but there's a gap between when they run down some of their inventory on the X and then wait to fully ramp up on the X. So you will see that balance out over time. We don't have any doubts on that. And then, on the X, I want to reemphasize, and I think you will have seen this from your channel checks as well, demand and interest in the innovation and the capabilities that the X brings remain strong. I think we are very excited about the launch of the 25B and I think those of you who attended ASHE would have seen our customers' interest in that and the data that's coming out of the other 25B and the improvements that we continue to make on the software really resonate with our customers. So we remain very interested in that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah, hi, Jacob. Good to have you on board here. So if I could ask two-part questions, with the 25B launch, can you talk a little bit about how, and maybe Joydeep can chime in and talk about how the transformation is going to be sort of over the next couple of months. You obviously get a price uptick with the 25B, but not all customers are going to be able to essentially fill up that flow cell. So there's going to be a bit of an ebb and flow. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about that, at least qualitatively in the near term. And then a bigger competition question. Jacob, you've seen the LCMS businesses and other businesses in China, what do you imagine for China -- for Illumina with, one of the bigger competitors over there? How do you see Illumina's position in China, longer term? And if I may just ask, again, on competition, one of your diagnostic customers, NIPT and MRD customer pointed out that they're validating different platforms. So again, what's your view on competition? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: No, thank you very much, Puneet and again, I'm very pleased to be here. Let me start with the China question. As you're right, I have certainly some experience of running businesses in China. I'm very familiar with the China itself and how to operate businesses there. So what is, of course, more unique for Illumina than some of the other life science tools companies is that Illumina has a Chinese competitor that have at least good enough sequencing capabilities here. But China continues to be an extremely important country for us and we are right now working through and in China for China strategy to really be much better positioned in China going forward and we are committing to China and I think we can actually do really well in China. Many of our customers in China prefers to work with Illumina for what we stand for, both quality, but also that we are the number one brand out there. So we will continue to be very strong in China. Generally speaking on competition, yes, you're right. There are competition out there. As you also know, I'm very familiar with being in a very competitive environment and I think that with what Illumina has which I think will serve us extremely well is that we have a very strong brand. We have a very strong installed base. Almost all papers coming out is based on our technology and also, of course, what I see internally with the roadmap we have for the pipeline of new products coming out, our innovation capabilities, will continue to position us very extremely competitive in this environment. But of course, I understand and I'm fully aware that we will be in a very competitive situation forward. And in the end, I think that just keeps us really focused on our customers and we'll do our best for our customers. So I'm here, I'm ready to fight for it.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yeah, maybe I'll tag on there. Let me start with the competition. We obviously, as Jacob said, take it seriously, but also monitor it very carefully across the globe through what we're seeing out in the field. So I will say outside of China, we have seen the competition and share have been what we had expected. Obviously, with new market entrants, you will see a little bit of a decline in share, but it has been outside of China very much according to expectations. On the 25B, Puneet, so let me start by saying what we have seen in this is early indicators that when we look at sequencing activity growth and we measured it by gigabase, we are seeing that customers who have adopted DX have seen a faster growth rate in output and sequencing output than customers who have not adopted DX, right. So this is an encouraging sign that X is actually spurring more sequencing activity at these customers. And again, it's still very early days. They're ramping up, they're validating fully on their particular workflows. With 25B, I think you're right. It will spur even more capacity and experiments. We've heard customers that want to run very large single cell experiments, for example, be very excited about this 25B and the capabilities that it brings. So we expect that to play out. I think when you get in the dynamics of whether you're running full flow cells or not, there is a very complex interaction of things that will lead to higher prices per gigabase until you fully load your flow cells. So we can get into that offline, but we do expect those dynamics to be very similar to what you saw when you brought on NovaSeq 6000 and some of the other S4 flow cells, etcetera.\nJacob Thaysen: But I think also, Joydeep, just to finish on the opportunity that we have seen, at least the customers that I've met here in the clinical space, are very excited with the new flow cell as this opens up for new assays, new products, offering that they haven't had before. So while it will take them a little while, of course, to validate and get up and running, we see many of them right now rushing to be first to market with this.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Yeah, hi guys, thanks for the question here. Jacob, just to follow up on the special committee that will look at GRAIL, what's the general timeline that they're expected to be on with respect to reaching a decision and then can you update us on when the GRAIL team is expecting to see a readout for the NHS gallery study at this point, thanks.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, so I can tell you that we are working as quickly as we can under the framework to look at the options here. And I can tell you, I'm as frustrated as all of you, and I look forward to get this behind us. So we are working on very tight timelines. At this point, I don't want to commit to anything because I want to make sure that I can deliver on my commitments on any timeline here. So by the way, I also want to share with you that this morning we got the feedback from the ECGA that they have now put in a date for the hearing, oral hearing, which would be mid-December. So it's good news in the way that things now are moving forward. And just on that, that the appeals are important to us, obviously for the reason of GRAIL, but probably as important for ensuring that we have the flexibility for future transactions that we will look into and obviously also we can get rid of the finance and so on. So that's why the appeals continues to be important.\nJoydeep Goswami: NHS' GRAIL readout timing, I think, that's as GRAIL had stated before, that's the final expectation on that is some point in 2024, and they will have a fully readout as well, or preliminary readout before that.\nOperator: And we have a question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question and welcome board. I guess I want to follow up on the earlier question about sort of underlying demand in the market and what gives you confidence in some of the longer term view. And I guess I'll phrase it in terms of your update to the guide here in the third quarter. You're citing some of the same macro headwinds that others are in terms of what's going on in China, in terms of broader funding concerns and budget tightness and you're saying that that's sort of weighing on consumables purchases. But at the same time, you're not getting the switch over to the NovaX because if you're looking at the order book, the orders have barely grown between 2Q and 3Q. You went from 260 to 310. So orders were up 50 units in the quarter and you placed 97. So it's not like there's a ton of demand growing for NovaX and yet the Nova 6000 consumable seems to be really slowing. So I'm just trying to reconcile that, if people aren't sequencing on the Nova 6000 because they're gearing up for the Nova X, then you would only see those orders grow. So how can you confidently state that some of this is that transition between instruments and not just less underlying demand in the market?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, so let me just start again, address that we do see the demand in the market space. We also mentioned this overall, that we see more gigabase growth rates. So we see definitely that it's a lot of activities out there and again, there's no doubt that the long-term perspective in this market is very healthy. I think what you're seeing is that we're running through and a very challenging environment that everybody else is seeing. And I think everybody also last year when they were providing guidance, they were probably optimistic that things would shrink back in the second half and everybody got surprised or at least that it didn't. So therefore we are right now a little more prudent in how we look out in the future. So I think that's one element to it, but if you look into the specifics, I think Joydeep can provide a little more insights.\nJoydeep Goswami: So I think there's a couple of things when we look at, why is it further -- the slowdown is further impacted by the transition, right? So definitely Michael, there is an element of the overall macro slowdown. But two things I will tell you about the transition, right? So we look very carefully at high throughput customers that have purchased the X versus those that have not purchased an X and we see definitely that the 6K consumables slowdown is much more pronounced to these customers that have bought the X, right? So that gives us a very good control mechanism of isolating the impact of transition versus the broader macroeconomic trends. And again, realize that they're still ramping up with the X and the 25B really for many of these customers that are early adopters, they're really the higher users, the higher output users for the NovaSeq X, right? So you will see that transition coming, the ramp up on the X consumables coming, especially after the launch of the 25B, but it will take them a few months to get up to full capacity once they've validated their workflows.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys, good evening and Jacob, welcome to Illumina. I had a couple of questions for you here. Starting on the GRAIL side of things, looks like you're expecting this ECJ decision in mid-'24. So can you just walk us through the implications of that in terms of what the committee can really do ahead of that timeframe and then beyond the ongoing sort of court cases and figuring out if and how to divest this asset, how are you thinking about monetizing the data value that's embedded within GRAIL? Is that an active discussion that's being had at the board level within this committee as well? And the final part of my question really is a broader one on Core Illumina. Where are you in terms of the key leadership roles? Are those -- do you feel like you have a settled team yet or could we see some sort of significant changes in the months ahead? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, so let me start by addressing the GRAIL situation and I think I mentioned before, and that's why I put the committee in place, or special committee in place, is that we have the European divestiture order and obviously, while we still run the appeals, we will do everything within the framework to move as quickly as possible. As I also mentioned in my remarks is that as soon as we have filed the Form 10, we will go out there and start to talk to potential acquirers and so on. So also looking for the spin and so on. So we are moving as quick as we can within that framework and we will move, yeah, again, we will move as much as we can here. So there's really nothing that holds us back from, the appeals really runs in parallel. So there's nothing that prevents us from moving as quick as we can within that. So I think that on that, if you look at the monetization of GRAIL, I don't know, Joydeep, do you have any thinking about that?\nJoydeep Goswami: I think mostly it's -- you're talking about GRAIL data here. So this is one of the options that obviously the committee will consider and we will consider as a team, but it also really depends on the divestiture option that's chosen and what we agree going back and forth with the European Commission here. So it is one of the things that is absolutely in consideration of the various options that, Jacob mentioned that the committee is going to bring up.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, and then the last question, I think was on the leadership team and I will put it more broadly saying that I will be performing a comprehensive business review over the next period of time. As again, I've been here 40 days and I'm really impressed with the team and the talented people we have in the organization. But I'll of course keep you updated on what my thinking is while we move forward here in '24.\nOperator: And we have a question from Dan Leonard with UBS.\nDan Leonard: Thank you and hello, Jacob. Now that you're sort of transitioning to maybe a bit more of a hand to mouth demand cycle for the X, given that you don't have much backlog left, I was hoping you could elaborate what the pipeline looks like, any metrics you could offer. And is it possible you could quantify, how much is the sales cycle lengthening? Is it double what it used to be? Is it some different multiple? Just anything you could help us contextualize that.\nJacob Thaysen: I think Dan, again, I would like to invite Joydeep into provide a little more insights on where we are, but I can say generally speaking, the sales cycle is extended quite a lot from what we used to. Not only because it takes time to make the decision, but also to get it through all the levels that there's much more scrutiny on all levels in the decision making and we've seen that. We see that in Illumina, but I think that's a general thing that is happening in industry right now. But Joydeep, you want to go a little closer?\nJoydeep Goswami: I just want to corroborate, Jacob right, what you said. We see strong interest still in the X and obviously with the launch of the 25D, that has perked up even more. And the pipeline continues to have hundreds of opportunities there, right. So we're not suffering a decline in the pipeline. We continue to add opportunities to the pipeline. What has been, because of the macroeconomic situation, a little bit more challenging for us is converting that pipeline into orders as quickly as we had imagined. So that is the lengthening of the sales cycle that you talked about and we expect that that will continue for us and for others for a little bit of time into the future here, right, till macroeconomic conditions return, but there's no doubt that they're not -- it's not that the demand is shifting to some other technology or some other instrument. It is still very much centered on the X and we still continue to have conversations with our customers to get them there and once they have bought it, to really ramp them up and get them ramped up as quickly as possible so that it can pull through the consumables as quickly as possible.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, and again, as Joydeep was saying, we have a healthy pipeline and just as an evidence that this is moving, we just here over the last few days, we received 10 pieces of, what is it, 10 instrument order on our X from one of our biggest customers. So we are definitely seeing that there is really customers really like the X and can really see that it can be utilized very nicely.\nJoydeep Goswami: Now Jacob, that's a good point. That's a fleet expansion order. So they have had experience with the X and they are doubling down, right?\nOperator: And we have a question from Sung Ji Nam with Scotia Bank.\nSung Ji Nam: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and welcome to Jacob. Just a quick one on GRAIL, kind of what's the key driver of the guidance, updated guidance being at the low end of the prior range? Thanks.\nJacob Thaysen: I can handle it. So again, it's mostly two things. So they did have this particular year some challenges with their PDX revenue. This is the pharma services revenue and then gallery sales are, while they're growing nicely, have been lower than their initial expectations, right? So both those have impacted it.\nJoydeep Goswami: But still a healthy growth.\nJacob Thaysen: So very healthy growth. We're seeing that at 100%-ish.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.\nKyle Mikson: Hey, thanks. Welcome, Jacob. Two part question. First on GRAIL, second on Core. On the GRAIL funding in conjunction with the divestiture, if it is a capital market transaction, company's going to need 2.5 year's cash. I think that was touched on earlier. You could provide that via equity raise or debt issuance. Could you just walk through what your exact options are to produce that capital if you don't do equity or debt offering? And then on the Core business, you guys mentioned the initial view on 2024. Is that a little similar to 2023? Does that mean that revenue is going to be flat year-over-year for the third year in a row and then maybe you could just comment on orders and placements for next year? Like, could placements grow in 2024? Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, so let me start by the second question here and again, we will come out with the full guidance in our Q4 '23 call in February, but I'm just sharing you with the initial view we have on 2024 right now and due to the macroeconomic environment, we want to, and we don't see that change right now. If it changes during 2024, obviously, we will see more momentum in the business, but I felt it was important to share with all of you right now on how we see the year. There are more details behind it, but we're still working through the rest of this year. And we're still finalizing the 2000 and, of course, 2024 budget also. So it's too early for me to share details about the year, but what I can tell you, as we said before, is that we still have a strong pipeline on X particularly and we expect, and we're just seeing that the sales cycle is taking longer than we expected, but you should actually see that the consumables are starting to pick up in 2024 also.\nJoydeep Goswami: And on the GRAIL, I think I've mentioned this earlier. Look, there are several options now on the table that we could help pay for the 2.5 years of funding requirements. So for example, if you went for a spin, there are options around a sponsored spin where a sponsor could put in a fair chunk of the money, or some or all of the money that is required for that funding. The other one, which is more of a capital markets transaction, which is more of a split kind of option where you could go and raise money in capital markets for GRAIL and IPO market for GRAIL. So we're looking through and working through those various options. They're, of course, dependent on specific market conditions and interest in GRAIL from private placement. So we'll keep you posted on that as we go out to the market and consider those options.\nOperator: And we'll take a question from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys, thanks for the questions and welcome, Jacob. I guess just on your comments on '24, when you say results might look similar to '23, in that case, I guess, how do you view Core Illumina op margins? Would those also look similar to '23 or given some of the cost reductions that you guys have talked about, do you think there's room for improvement there?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, thanks for that. So I think right now that Illumina have a wonderful model, actually. I think we have really strong operating gross margins. So obviously with growth, we can really fuel that to the bottom also, but in a flat environment and with, of course, we are seeing that more challenging. So right now we are -- we expecting to be flat both on top line and on the bottom line.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yeah, and I think, you're right. We do expect to see an improvement in gross margins next year, obviously with more zeroables mixed in there. Off the cost reductions that we have made this year, I just want to remind you that some of that, substantial portion of that has already been recognized this year. So they won't be incremental to next year as we go through. And then offsetting those two positives is, we do expect that the variable compensation and sort of rationalization and year-over-year comp on that will eat away into that goodness that you've had and coupled with merit increases in inflation, right? So, and again, we did not pay executives the stock-based compensation and variable compensation this year as our performance has not been up to par. So we do expect that that will come back into next year as we correct some of that.\nJacob Thaysen: But I think on that, I think, everything I see here, as I mentioned, also the gross margins are strong in the company, but there's a lot we can do to continue to improve that. So I don't see anything that is, for me at least coming in here, see there's any difference in the thesis about Illumina going back to what has been historical margins. And we will work on that. I think historically we have been, the logic has been, this will come through growth and clearly we need growth to drive some of that, but we will also really focus on operational excellence see to build that going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets.\nConor McNamara: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question and Jacob, welcome to San Diego. Just, if I look at kind of what you've said about 2024, from pre-pandemic levels from 2019 to 2024, that would imply an annual growth rate on the core business of about 5%, which is roughly in line with, the overall life science tools market, despite the fact that you guys have consistently spent about 20% of sales in R&D. So if I'm an investor looking at Illumina, should I think of this as an EBIT margin expansion story from here where you bring R&D down in line with peers or do you think that you guys can't, you can drive a return to growth above historic life science tools growth levels?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, that, again, I want to be careful on coming with too many comments right now. I'm 40 days into my work here, to my job here, but I think I still believe that Illumina has a better growth opportunity than many of the other life science tools company and I will come back and give you more insights when I'm ready for it later in 2024, but I don't think that Illumina is in a place where it's in the level of many of the other companies right now, but it's too early for me to give you a clear guidance, but yeah, so wait and see.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great, thanks for taking the questions and welcome to Illumina, Jacob. So first up, I just wanted to ask on Core Illumina margins, follow up on some of the earlier questions. Specifically, it looks like that implied 4Q margin stepped down for Core Illumina, but also given the lower placement number, your mix should be more skewed towards consumables than typical in 4Q. So is there anything else that we should look at from a one-time perspective or anything else on the puts and takes on that margin implied for 4Q?\nJacob Thaysen: Joydeep, do you want to take that?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yeah, so Rachel, a couple of things, right? So you will see margins and operating margins decline. We are seeing a step down in revenue from Q3 into Q4. So that's one element of that. The second element is gross margins are impacted for several reasons, right? One, that we do see every time you see a reduction in volume, you have less absorption of fixed costs, so you have that flowing into it. The second piece is around, yes, we are seeing some shift from instruments into consumables, but we are seeing a reduction because of the transition effects of NovaSeq 6000 consumables, which are highly profitable and so you're seeing a little bit of gross margin decline because of that. And then the third is we have some components of strategic deal revenue that we have coming in, in Q4 versus Q3, and that is also pulling down our gross margin. So those three components are really what are impacting the gross margin component. And in the operating margin side, I think we obviously are getting some of the benefits of the cost action that we saw, but we did have some movement of R&D specific timing investments that moved from Q3 into Q4. So that is taking up our Q4 operating expense a little bit compared to what we had in Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Jacob Thaysen for closing remarks.\nJacob Thaysen: Thank you, everyone. As we finish the year and move into 2024, I want to reiterate the great foundation that we have here, both in the infrastructure that we have built and in the significant markets that we serve. It is clear to me that there's a tremendous opportunity to create value for our customers and our partners worldwide, and of course for our shareholders. Thank you again. We're looking forward to see you at upcoming conferences and other events. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and in the supplementary data available on our website. As Jacob noted, in the third quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was flat year-over-year and up 1% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue was down 5% from the second quarter of 2023. Although we correctly anticipated a sequential decrease in high-throughput consumables revenue due to the NovaSeq X transition, we placed fewer NovaSeq X instruments than we expected in the quarter, as customers' purchase constraints led to lengthened sales cycles. Non-GAAP net income was $52 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $155 million for the quarter. Despite our lower revenue, non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense reduction initiatives and a higher gross margin than we forecast. GAAP net loss was $754 million, or $4.77 per diluted share, which included goodwill and intangible impairments of $821 million related to the GRAIL segment. These impairments were primarily the result of a decrease in Illumina's consolidated market capitalization and a higher discount rate used for the fair value cancellation of the GRAIL segment. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 39.7% for the quarter, which decreased from 43.2% in Q3 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the non-GAAP tax expense, impact of R&D capitalization requirements, given increased amortization of capitalized R&D expenses. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results; Core Illumina revenue of $1.11 billion was flat year-over-year on both the reported and constant currency basis, and included anticipated reductions of approximately seven percentage points from two primary categories. One, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represent approximately 3.5 percentage points and two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that also is approximately 3.5 percentage points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q3 2023, compared to $28 million in Q3 2022. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was down 4% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by a 12% decline in sales research customers. These customers were impacted by the NovaSeq X transition and are reducing NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by the COVID, Russia and China factors I noted previously, as well as the impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer's purchasing power and project planning. Strength in sales to clinical customers partially offset the decline in research, with clinical sequencing consumables growing 10% year-over-year, led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing. Turning to sequencing activity, total sequencing gigabase output on connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 5% from Q2 2023 and 29% year-over-year. We are encouraged by the trends we're seeing across both research and clinical high-throughput customers that have a NovaSeq X installed. As expected, these customers show higher overall growth in sequencing output than high-throughput customers that have not yet adopted the NovaSeq X, both on a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $179 million grew 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid-throughput due to increasing capital purchase and cash flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally, as well as by local competition in China. For NovaSeq X, we exited Q3 with more than 310 orders since launch. Our shipments of 97 NovaSeq X instruments in Q3 brought our total installed base to 273 instruments. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $142 million was up 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, as well as an increase in lab services revenue. Moving to regional results for Core Illumina, all regions continue to be impacted by two key issues. One, tighter funding and budget pressures that are impacting customer purchasing power and project planning and two, the impact of high-throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X as customers continue to reduce NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. America's revenue of $650 million grew 10% year-over-year, attributed to NovaSeq X placements, as well as clinical testing volume driving greater consumables revenue. Clinical sequencing consumables shipments grew more than 20% year-over-year. Europe revenue of $260 million was flat year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis. Growth in sequencing consumables was driven by mid-teens growth in clinical and strength in mid-throughput consumables offset by the decline in COVID surveillance and the negative impact of exchange rates. For sequencing instruments, growth in high throughput due to NovaSeq X placements was more than offset by a decline in mid-throughput instruments. India revenue of $98 million declined 22% year-over-year or 19% on a constant currency basis, which included an 11 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. The year-over-year decrease was also driven by softness in Japan due to the macroeconomic factors I mentioned earlier as well as the expected slowdown in COVID surveillance. Greater China revenue of $98 million represented a 26% decrease year-over-year or 25% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges as well as local competition in mid-throughput. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 66% decreased 290 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix and less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes as well as lower instrument margins and higher field service and installation cost due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $481 million were down $33 million year-over-year and were lower than expected primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives. As a result of these factors, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5% in Q3 2023 compared to 22.6% in Q3 2022. Despite our lower gross margin, operating margin was approximately flat year-over-year due to our proactive cost management initiatives. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL; GRAIL revenue of $21 million for the quarter grew 110% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses total $161 million and increased $12 million year-over-year driven primarily by efforts to scale GRAIL's commercial and R&D organizations. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items; cash flow provided by operations was $139 million. Third quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $45 million and free cash flow was $94 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $933 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the third quarter of 2023, the company used $750 million in cash to repay the outstanding principle of convertible notes that matured in August 2023. Moving now to 2023 guidance; we now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to decline 2% to 3% from 2022, including Core Illumina revenue that is down 3% to 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions in Russia of approximately 100 basis points, reductions in our business in China, as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GRAIL revenue is now expected to be at the low end of the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. For fiscal 2023, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year driven by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally, as well as the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by our lower NovaSeq X shipment expectations for 2023. We now expect to ship between 330 NovaSeq X to 340 NovaSeq X instruments for the year as customers' purchasing constraints lead to lengthened sale cycles. We also now expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by the decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers transition to NovaSeq X. The impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer project planning and budgets, the effect of sanctions in Russia, the slowdown in COVID surveillance, and the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance primarily reflects a slower ramp in NovaSeq X consumables, in part due to our lower placement expectations, as well as the increasing impacts of macroeconomic constraints. We now expect Core Illumina total sequencing revenue to decline 3% to 4% year-over-year. This continues to include intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 4% to 4.5%, and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of 19% to 19.5%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year, partially offset by continued expense reduction initiatives. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 39% for 2023, due to discrete tax benefit recognized in Q3 2023 related to prior year return adjustments. Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 for 2023, reflecting non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares. Dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss is now expected to be approximately $660 million, as GRAIL continues to manage its expense base in line of its latest revenue outlook. I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. Yeah, Vijay. Hey, so on the 2.5 years of cash support or to GRAIL, we're still working with the European Commission on exactly what that means in terms of a numerical number. So I'm not at liberty to disclose those details. We will come back with that once we have alignment, but I think as Jacob alluded to, this is not something that we have to provide all on our own. We have several options now that we have worked with the EC to come out with a, or to have a divestiture order that is in line with our expectations of flexibility to use even in the case of a spin or a split decision, we can get in a sponsor that can support all or a part of the requirement for the 2.5 years of cash support or we can go to the markets and raise that money as well. So stay tuned on that one. No, I think, I think Jacob, that's right. On the guidance piece, look, we made a commitment to you to come back to you with any read on the macroeconomics we see, and I think we're held up to that commitment. In fact, we may have been a little bit canary in the coal mine signaling some of this earlier to you, especially this year than others, right? One of the things, of course, you did bring up with the elongated, sort of lack of growth or the reduced growth that we have had. That is true. I think, part of what hit us at the same time as the macroeconomics going down is the transition, major transition on our platform, which has hit us as customers move from the 6,000 to the X, but there's a gap between when they run down some of their inventory on the X and then wait to fully ramp up on the X. So you will see that balance out over time. We don't have any doubts on that. And then, on the X, I want to reemphasize, and I think you will have seen this from your channel checks as well, demand and interest in the innovation and the capabilities that the X brings remain strong. I think we are very excited about the launch of the 25B and I think those of you who attended ASHE would have seen our customers' interest in that and the data that's coming out of the other 25B and the improvements that we continue to make on the software really resonate with our customers. So we remain very interested in that. Yeah, maybe I'll tag on there. Let me start with the competition. We obviously, as Jacob said, take it seriously, but also monitor it very carefully across the globe through what we're seeing out in the field. So I will say outside of China, we have seen the competition and share have been what we had expected. Obviously, with new market entrants, you will see a little bit of a decline in share, but it has been outside of China very much according to expectations. On the 25B, Puneet, so let me start by saying what we have seen in this is early indicators that when we look at sequencing activity growth and we measured it by gigabase, we are seeing that customers who have adopted DX have seen a faster growth rate in output and sequencing output than customers who have not adopted DX, right. So this is an encouraging sign that X is actually spurring more sequencing activity at these customers. And again, it's still very early days. They're ramping up, they're validating fully on their particular workflows. With 25B, I think you're right. It will spur even more capacity and experiments. We've heard customers that want to run very large single cell experiments, for example, be very excited about this 25B and the capabilities that it brings. So we expect that to play out. I think when you get in the dynamics of whether you're running full flow cells or not, there is a very complex interaction of things that will lead to higher prices per gigabase until you fully load your flow cells. So we can get into that offline, but we do expect those dynamics to be very similar to what you saw when you brought on NovaSeq 6000 and some of the other S4 flow cells, etcetera. NHS' GRAIL readout timing, I think, that's as GRAIL had stated before, that's the final expectation on that is some point in 2024, and they will have a fully readout as well, or preliminary readout before that. So I think there's a couple of things when we look at, why is it further -- the slowdown is further impacted by the transition, right? So definitely Michael, there is an element of the overall macro slowdown. But two things I will tell you about the transition, right? So we look very carefully at high throughput customers that have purchased the X versus those that have not purchased an X and we see definitely that the 6K consumables slowdown is much more pronounced to these customers that have bought the X, right? So that gives us a very good control mechanism of isolating the impact of transition versus the broader macroeconomic trends. And again, realize that they're still ramping up with the X and the 25B really for many of these customers that are early adopters, they're really the higher users, the higher output users for the NovaSeq X, right? So you will see that transition coming, the ramp up on the X consumables coming, especially after the launch of the 25B, but it will take them a few months to get up to full capacity once they've validated their workflows. I think mostly it's -- you're talking about GRAIL data here. So this is one of the options that obviously the committee will consider and we will consider as a team, but it also really depends on the divestiture option that's chosen and what we agree going back and forth with the European Commission here. So it is one of the things that is absolutely in consideration of the various options that, Jacob mentioned that the committee is going to bring up. I just want to corroborate, Jacob right, what you said. We see strong interest still in the X and obviously with the launch of the 25D, that has perked up even more. And the pipeline continues to have hundreds of opportunities there, right. So we're not suffering a decline in the pipeline. We continue to add opportunities to the pipeline. What has been, because of the macroeconomic situation, a little bit more challenging for us is converting that pipeline into orders as quickly as we had imagined. So that is the lengthening of the sales cycle that you talked about and we expect that that will continue for us and for others for a little bit of time into the future here, right, till macroeconomic conditions return, but there's no doubt that they're not -- it's not that the demand is shifting to some other technology or some other instrument. It is still very much centered on the X and we still continue to have conversations with our customers to get them there and once they have bought it, to really ramp them up and get them ramped up as quickly as possible so that it can pull through the consumables as quickly as possible. Now Jacob, that's a good point. That's a fleet expansion order. So they have had experience with the X and they are doubling down, right? But still a healthy growth. And on the GRAIL, I think I've mentioned this earlier. Look, there are several options now on the table that we could help pay for the 2.5 years of funding requirements. So for example, if you went for a spin, there are options around a sponsored spin where a sponsor could put in a fair chunk of the money, or some or all of the money that is required for that funding. The other one, which is more of a capital markets transaction, which is more of a split kind of option where you could go and raise money in capital markets for GRAIL and IPO market for GRAIL. So we're looking through and working through those various options. They're, of course, dependent on specific market conditions and interest in GRAIL from private placement. So we'll keep you posted on that as we go out to the market and consider those options. Yeah, and I think, you're right. We do expect to see an improvement in gross margins next year, obviously with more zeroables mixed in there. Off the cost reductions that we have made this year, I just want to remind you that some of that, substantial portion of that has already been recognized this year. So they won't be incremental to next year as we go through. And then offsetting those two positives is, we do expect that the variable compensation and sort of rationalization and year-over-year comp on that will eat away into that goodness that you've had and coupled with merit increases in inflation, right? So, and again, we did not pay executives the stock-based compensation and variable compensation this year as our performance has not been up to par. So we do expect that that will come back into next year as we correct some of that. Yeah, so Rachel, a couple of things, right? So you will see margins and operating margins decline. We are seeing a step down in revenue from Q3 into Q4. So that's one element of that. The second element is gross margins are impacted for several reasons, right? One, that we do see every time you see a reduction in volume, you have less absorption of fixed costs, so you have that flowing into it. The second piece is around, yes, we are seeing some shift from instruments into consumables, but we are seeing a reduction because of the transition effects of NovaSeq 6000 consumables, which are highly profitable and so you're seeing a little bit of gross margin decline because of that. And then the third is we have some components of strategic deal revenue that we have coming in, in Q4 versus Q3, and that is also pulling down our gross margin. So those three components are really what are impacting the gross margin component. And in the operating margin side, I think we obviously are getting some of the benefits of the cost action that we saw, but we did have some movement of R&D specific timing investments that moved from Q3 into Q4. So that is taking up our Q4 operating expense a little bit compared to what we had in Q3."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Thank you, Sally. Good day everyone and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role as Illumina's CEO a little over six weeks ago. It is an honor to lead this company. I joined Illumina after more than a decade at Agilent, where I ran both the Diagnostic and Genomics Group, and more recently, Agilent's largest business, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group. I have long admired Illumina for its role in building the genomics market, and I'm incredibly excited to be here. During my first weeks, I prioritized getting to know our employees and meeting with several of our customers. Illumina has a highly capable team, and I have been impressed with their level of passion and commitment to our work. Both our employees and our customers are driven to move genomics forward. Like our team, I'm passionate about genomics and the role that this field can play in healthcare and personalized medicine, particularly in the oncology space. This is a massive opportunity, and Illumina will remain the key player, even as others enter the market. Illumina's infrastructure that we have built over two and a half decades, our compelling offerings that set the global standard, and our deep commitment to innovation for the future will continue to drive the use of genomics and multiomics around the world. Turning to our third quarter results; in Q3, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.12 billion, flat year-over-year, or up 1% on a constant currency basis. This was a disappointing result. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging for our industry and for our customers, with customers increasingly cautious and constrained in their purchasing decisions. Despite a lower gross margin year-over-year, tight management of our operating expenses allowed us to deliver diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, also approximately flat year-over-year. While we cannot control external environment, Illumina's management team and I remain focused on supporting our customers and our own operational execution. Part of my comprehensive review of the business includes reexamining our strategic initiatives and our targets for long-term revenue growth and operating margins. We will lay out our new targets for you later next year. A key priority for me is to get clarity on the GRAIL situation. Therefore, I have requested and the Board has established a special committee to expedite decisions on GRAIL. Furthermore, we have retained advices and are preparing for sale and capital markets transactions. We expect to file a Form-10 on a confidential basis with the SEC. Hereafter, we will contact third parties as investment capital sources or as potential purchasers as our appeals are ongoing. I know there have been questions regarding our appeals. These appeals are not just about GRAIL. They provide Illumina with flexibility for any divestiture of GRAIL and also for future transactions. The appeals will not impact our ability to move swiftly. Make no mistake, I'm here to focus on the core business, which I will talk more about after Joydeep's remarks. Joydeep? Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate Illumina's commitment to supporting our customers in this difficult macroeconomic environment. While we cannot control for external factors, we can optimize our own actions to successfully navigate through this period and position the company for a return to accelerated growth on the other side. I know you're interested to hear our views for 2024. With the caveat that we haven't finished 2023, we're still looking at our budget for 2024. Our initial views is that 2024 results will look very similar to 2023. We don't expect near-term improvement to the macroeconomic environment, and geopolitical issues have been persistent. We are encouraged with the early signs we're seeing for NovaSeq X utilization and the continued rollout of the X position us very well for the ramp in consumables and overall growth with the market conditions improve. This is clearly a dynamic situation, and we want to be able to develop our views in depth. Therefore, for 2024, we will not provide guidance before our Q4 earnings call in February. The main reason that I joined Illumina was my strong conviction about the future of the Core Illumina business. While over the coming month, I'll continue to listen and learn, I will also be focused on several key priorities. First, we need to drive our top line as much as possible in this environment. This means continuous placements of the NovaSeq X and all of our instruments, laying the groundwork for increased consumables demand. We'll continue working closely with our customers around the world, whether they're integrating new instruments into their workflows, starting new projects, or building new tests or assays. Second, we need to keep driving innovation that is highly focused on our customers' priorities. These innovations include automation and sample-to-answer solutions, serve to strengthen our leadership position around the world. At the same time, we need to manage our R&D investments with discipline and rigor. We most recently launched our 25B Rating Kit. This was highly anticipated by our customers, and it will unleash the full power of the NovaSeq X. Third, we need to focus our own operational excellence across geographies, functions, and processes. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce our analyzed run rate expenses. Our team has executed well and has been able to reduce analyzed run rate expenses by approximately $175 million, ahead of our original projection of more than $100 million. These savings will continue to support flexibility in further investment in high-growth areas and our margins. I'm committed to executing against all of these priorities with a strong sense of urgency. We are focused on delivering tangible improvements that support profitable long-term growth for Illumina and for our shareholders. I will now invite the operator to open for the line of Q&A. Yeah, Vijay, thank you very much and I'm really excited to be here at Illumina and let me start with your second question and then I'll have Joydeep step in also on talking about what those 2.5 years means, but as I discussed here, coming into the company, I felt it was very important to get clarity on GRAIL and it was very important for me to have the support for the board and to make swift decisions to move forward and thereby, we started a special committee with three of the board members, including, and then besides me, that is the chairing of that committee. So I have three board members and plus me that will work with the management team and to really walk through all the elements around the divestiture order to make sure we can make some fast decisions. We need to make decisions which path we're going to follow. Is it going to be a trade sale, the spin, the split, without a sponsor and of course, there's a lot of considerations related to that. That's really what the special committee is helping me and the rest of the management team to do. Joydeep. No, thanks, Dan. And I think I would have Joydeep also jumping in on some of those elements here, but let me just start by coming here into Illumina and my observation both from when I was outside Illumina, but also coming in, I think that the core business has a tremendous opportunity. I think there's a lot of opportunities in the NGS markets and I think we are definitely through a tough period right now. I think the whole life science tools industry is seeing it and certainly here at Illumina, we're not immune for that, but the growth rates, even though I will spend time here over the next period of time still learning the business and really understand the organization. So at this point of time, I don't have a final opinion about what I think is the right growth rates for the business and what we're committing to, but I will certainly come back later in '24 and share all of that with you when I'm ready for it. But in the meantime, I think that the overall market is very healthy and there will be a lot of growth opportunities for Illumina going forward and I can then say that some of the findings coming into the company and really digging deep into our innovation engine and what our roadmaps look like. I'm very excited for the future of this company. I think we will continue to pioneer in this area. So I think on guidance and Joydeep joining here also, but in the end, we wanted to make sure when we signal also from, especially '24 here that, that at this point, we want to be prudent in how we set our, it's not a guidance yet, but at least how we view '24, as we simply don't see any change, short-term change in the economical environment and therefore we felt it was important for, to go out now and then share our observations, but Joydeep, do you want to? No, thank you very much, Puneet and again, I'm very pleased to be here. Let me start with the China question. As you're right, I have certainly some experience of running businesses in China. I'm very familiar with the China itself and how to operate businesses there. So what is, of course, more unique for Illumina than some of the other life science tools companies is that Illumina has a Chinese competitor that have at least good enough sequencing capabilities here. But China continues to be an extremely important country for us and we are right now working through and in China for China strategy to really be much better positioned in China going forward and we are committing to China and I think we can actually do really well in China. Many of our customers in China prefers to work with Illumina for what we stand for, both quality, but also that we are the number one brand out there. So we will continue to be very strong in China. Generally speaking on competition, yes, you're right. There are competition out there. As you also know, I'm very familiar with being in a very competitive environment and I think that with what Illumina has which I think will serve us extremely well is that we have a very strong brand. We have a very strong installed base. Almost all papers coming out is based on our technology and also, of course, what I see internally with the roadmap we have for the pipeline of new products coming out, our innovation capabilities, will continue to position us very extremely competitive in this environment. But of course, I understand and I'm fully aware that we will be in a very competitive situation forward. And in the end, I think that just keeps us really focused on our customers and we'll do our best for our customers. So I'm here, I'm ready to fight for it. But I think also, Joydeep, just to finish on the opportunity that we have seen, at least the customers that I've met here in the clinical space, are very excited with the new flow cell as this opens up for new assays, new products, offering that they haven't had before. So while it will take them a little while, of course, to validate and get up and running, we see many of them right now rushing to be first to market with this. Yeah, so I can tell you that we are working as quickly as we can under the framework to look at the options here. And I can tell you, I'm as frustrated as all of you, and I look forward to get this behind us. So we are working on very tight timelines. At this point, I don't want to commit to anything because I want to make sure that I can deliver on my commitments on any timeline here. So by the way, I also want to share with you that this morning we got the feedback from the ECGA that they have now put in a date for the hearing, oral hearing, which would be mid-December. So it's good news in the way that things now are moving forward. And just on that, that the appeals are important to us, obviously for the reason of GRAIL, but probably as important for ensuring that we have the flexibility for future transactions that we will look into and obviously also we can get rid of the finance and so on. So that's why the appeals continues to be important. Yeah, so let me just start again, address that we do see the demand in the market space. We also mentioned this overall, that we see more gigabase growth rates. So we see definitely that it's a lot of activities out there and again, there's no doubt that the long-term perspective in this market is very healthy. I think what you're seeing is that we're running through and a very challenging environment that everybody else is seeing. And I think everybody also last year when they were providing guidance, they were probably optimistic that things would shrink back in the second half and everybody got surprised or at least that it didn't. So therefore we are right now a little more prudent in how we look out in the future. So I think that's one element to it, but if you look into the specifics, I think Joydeep can provide a little more insights. Yeah, so let me start by addressing the GRAIL situation and I think I mentioned before, and that's why I put the committee in place, or special committee in place, is that we have the European divestiture order and obviously, while we still run the appeals, we will do everything within the framework to move as quickly as possible. As I also mentioned in my remarks is that as soon as we have filed the Form 10, we will go out there and start to talk to potential acquirers and so on. So also looking for the spin and so on. So we are moving as quick as we can within that framework and we will move, yeah, again, we will move as much as we can here. So there's really nothing that holds us back from, the appeals really runs in parallel. So there's nothing that prevents us from moving as quick as we can within that. So I think that on that, if you look at the monetization of GRAIL, I don't know, Joydeep, do you have any thinking about that? Yeah, and then the last question, I think was on the leadership team and I will put it more broadly saying that I will be performing a comprehensive business review over the next period of time. As again, I've been here 40 days and I'm really impressed with the team and the talented people we have in the organization. But I'll of course keep you updated on what my thinking is while we move forward here in '24. I think Dan, again, I would like to invite Joydeep into provide a little more insights on where we are, but I can say generally speaking, the sales cycle is extended quite a lot from what we used to. Not only because it takes time to make the decision, but also to get it through all the levels that there's much more scrutiny on all levels in the decision making and we've seen that. We see that in Illumina, but I think that's a general thing that is happening in industry right now. But Joydeep, you want to go a little closer? Yeah, and again, as Joydeep was saying, we have a healthy pipeline and just as an evidence that this is moving, we just here over the last few days, we received 10 pieces of, what is it, 10 instrument order on our X from one of our biggest customers. So we are definitely seeing that there is really customers really like the X and can really see that it can be utilized very nicely. I can handle it. So again, it's mostly two things. So they did have this particular year some challenges with their PDX revenue. This is the pharma services revenue and then gallery sales are, while they're growing nicely, have been lower than their initial expectations, right? So both those have impacted it. So very healthy growth. We're seeing that at 100%-ish. Yeah, so let me start by the second question here and again, we will come out with the full guidance in our Q4 '23 call in February, but I'm just sharing you with the initial view we have on 2024 right now and due to the macroeconomic environment, we want to, and we don't see that change right now. If it changes during 2024, obviously, we will see more momentum in the business, but I felt it was important to share with all of you right now on how we see the year. There are more details behind it, but we're still working through the rest of this year. And we're still finalizing the 2000 and, of course, 2024 budget also. So it's too early for me to share details about the year, but what I can tell you, as we said before, is that we still have a strong pipeline on X particularly and we expect, and we're just seeing that the sales cycle is taking longer than we expected, but you should actually see that the consumables are starting to pick up in 2024 also. Yeah, thanks for that. So I think right now that Illumina have a wonderful model, actually. I think we have really strong operating gross margins. So obviously with growth, we can really fuel that to the bottom also, but in a flat environment and with, of course, we are seeing that more challenging. So right now we are -- we expecting to be flat both on top line and on the bottom line. But I think on that, I think, everything I see here, as I mentioned, also the gross margins are strong in the company, but there's a lot we can do to continue to improve that. So I don't see anything that is, for me at least coming in here, see there's any difference in the thesis about Illumina going back to what has been historical margins. And we will work on that. I think historically we have been, the logic has been, this will come through growth and clearly we need growth to drive some of that, but we will also really focus on operational excellence see to build that going forward. Yeah, that, again, I want to be careful on coming with too many comments right now. I'm 40 days into my work here, to my job here, but I think I still believe that Illumina has a better growth opportunity than many of the other life science tools company and I will come back and give you more insights when I'm ready for it later in 2024, but I don't think that Illumina is in a place where it's in the level of many of the other companies right now, but it's too early for me to give you a clear guidance, but yeah, so wait and see. Joydeep, do you want to take that? Thank you, everyone. As we finish the year and move into 2024, I want to reiterate the great foundation that we have here, both in the infrastructure that we have built and in the significant markets that we serve. It is clear to me that there's a tremendous opportunity to create value for our customers and our partners worldwide, and of course for our shareholders. Thank you again. We're looking forward to see you at upcoming conferences and other events. Thank you."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck.\nCharles Dadswell: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role of Illumina's interim CEO two months ago. Our search for a CEO is underway, and we look forward to updating you soon. Our Board is pleased with the outstanding candidates they are seeing.  Before going into our second quarter results, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our former CEO, Francis deSouza, and our former Chairman of the Board, John Thompson, for their thoughtfulness and commitment while at Illumina. I would also like to welcome our new Board members, Stephen MacMillan, our new Chairman of the Board, as well as Andrew Teno and Scott Ullem.  I also wanted to acknowledge changes in our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Technology Officer, Alex Aravanis, and our Chief Medical Officer, Phil Febbo. I speak for the whole company in wishing both of them every success in the future.  We also are pleased to announce that Steve Barnard, a 25-year Illumina employee and distinguished scientist in our field, will drive Illumina's legacy of innovation forward as our next Chief Technology Officer. We will be conducting a search for our next Chief Medical Officer.  Turning to our second quarter results: In Q2, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.18 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.32, both ahead of the guidance we provided in Q1. We shipped 109 NovaSeq X instruments in the quarter and have increased our expectations for our full year supply capacity to more than 390 instruments.  However, as you saw from our earnings release, we are reducing our guidance, and now expect core Illumina full year 2023 revenue to be approximately flat with 2022, primarily as a result of three factors.  First, a larger-than-expected temporary decline in high throughput consumables as we transition more-than-expected customers to the NovaSeq X. Second, many of our customers are remaining more cautious in their purchasing behaviors. And finally, in China, there is both a more protracted economic recovery and an increasingly challenged competitive landscape, in contrast to the Americas and Europe, where we are still expecting year-over-year growth in 2023. Joydeep will provide additional details on our revised guidance during his remarks.  One area I'd like to touch on further is the rollout of NovaSeq X. This has been a more challenging process than we anticipated. NovaSeq X is the most sophisticated platform we have ever launched and includes the most comprehensive end-to-end software we have ever released. Also, the rollout of the X has occurred at an unprecedented magnitude and pace. And we have identified issues in the field that are typical in new product releases.  To address these issues, we have taken actions including a planned software update that was released in June after our first customer shipment in March. We have deployed Illumina technical teams worldwide to work with our customers to accelerate bringing their systems online.  While the rollout of NovaSeq X will take longer than we originally expected, the continued strong interest and commitment of capital to purchase NovaSeq Xs remains encouraging. To date, 20% of customers who have purchased a NovaSeq X have ordered more than one instrument.  This early demand for multiple instruments and the capacity they represent underscores our confidence that customers are planning to increase their sequencing activity. Customers have clear intentions to do more sequencing in the future: Our customers have commented that larger scale single cell and spatial analysis experiments become more practical with the NovaSeq X, and they are requesting funding for these applications.  Customers engaged in large population genomics initiatives have stated they plan to run additional multiomic programs for population-specific variants, which can be used to develop treatments for various demographics that will be more effective in those populations.  And, as some of you have heard, several of our largest customers are using the X to accelerate the move from targeted panels and exomes to whole genome sequencing. We expect these types of projects to scale and ramp in the near future, and we will be closely engaged with our customers to support their needs.  We continue to consciously and actively reduce our expense base and have accelerated actions within the $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction program we announced at our last earnings call.  As you saw in our late June 8K filing, we have reduced our global headcount and are downsizing our global real estate footprint. We also are optimizing our third-party vendor spend and have reduced travel-related and other costs. For 2023, these steps are helping mitigate the impact of lower full-year revenue on our operating margin. Looking forward, these actions will continue to support our margins and create flexibility for further investment in high-growth areas.  Let me give you an update on a couple of our platforms: We saw continued global interest in the NovaSeq X series in Q2, and we exited the quarter with more than 260 orders since launch. Our shipments of 109 NovaSeq X instruments in Q2 were above our expectation of 80 for the quarter and brought our total installed base to 176 instruments. We now expect to be able to ship more than 390 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from the 330 we had previously expected for the year.  In mid-throughput, we shipped approximately 160 NextSeq 1k/2k units in the second quarter, an increase of 8% year-over- year, as customers expanded their current fleets or migrated from the MiSeq or NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q2 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers.  We continue to experience lengthened sales cycles, in some cases as customers take time to raise funding or prioritize their investment dollars, and in other cases as they run longer procurement processes.  Our win rate across the midthroughput segment, outside of China, increased from the first quarter. We believe there is a long runway of differentiation for the 1k/2k, notably with X-LEAP SBS chemistry coming available on these instruments next year.  Moving to our markets. In Q2, clinical represented approximately 53% of our total sequencing consumables revenue. In oncology, progress continued for next generation sequencing-based testing reimbursement.  Anthem, the second largest commercial payer in the US, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, both added coverage for comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with advanced cancers, adding more than 30 million additional covered lives. We also saw coverage continue to progress in Europe, with Switzerland now reimbursing large next generation sequencing panels, including comprehensive genomic profiling.  Illumina's market leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, remains on track to exceed more than $100 million in 2023 revenue. Growth continues to be driven by greater utilization and broader adoption of our assay.  In Q2, we also completed our TSO Comprehensive submission for IVD registration in the United States. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to achieve solid progress in the adoption of its Galleri multi-cancer early detection test. In Q2, GRAIL achieved its 100,000th commercial Galleri test milestone, and the test has now been prescribed by more than 7,500 providers in the US and ordered in more than 80 health systems.  As an update, on the NHS-Galleri study, in Q2 GRAIL completed second-year follow up visits, in which 130,000 participants returned, giving the trial a retention rate of 91.3%. Invitations for the third and final-year visits have begun, and the first appointments for those visits are expected this fall.  Evidence for Galleri continues to grow. At the most recent annual meeting held by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, GRAIL announced results from the University of Oxford-sponsored SYMPLIFY study, reporting high specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the cancer signal detected and cancer signal origin prediction, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of using an MCED test to assist clinicians with decisions regarding referrals from primary care physicians.  GRAIL is also making progress on its unique multi-cancer minimal residual disease test. At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, GRAIL and AstraZeneca presented new data that supports use of GRAIL's methylation platform to identify residual cancer in post-treatment settings.  GRAIL's technology had a cancer detection rate of 92% in patients with relapsed or refractory disease across six hematological malignancies. These findings demonstrate that GRAIL's blood-based methylation approach offers additional options to clinicians as they evaluate patients in efforts to achieve remission and improve survival.  Returning to core Illumina, in reproductive health, in the US, five state Medicaid programs \u2013 in Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee \u2013 updated their policies and are now covering non-invasive prenatal testing for all pregnancies.  In Europe, NIPT is now available for all pregnancies in the Netherlands and has been approved for broader coverage in Italy.  Turning to our research and applied markets, as we announced in mid-July, the Alliance for Genomic Discovery, launched by Illumina and Nashville Biosciences in 2022, now includes five founding members \u2013 AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, and Merck \u2013 and represents a novel, industry-led collaboration to accelerate development of therapeutics through large-scale genomics. Members will co-fund the whole-genome sequencing of 250,000 samples and all have access to the resulting data for use in drug discovery and therapeutic development.  The first phase in the Alliance was announced in January and involved whole-genome sequencing for 35,000 samples, primarily made up of DNA from individuals of African ancestry.  Before we move to Joydeep and then go to Q&A, I wanted to point out a couple of additional innovations we recently announced. In June, our PrimateAI-3D, an AI algorithm that predicts disease-causing genetic mutations in patients with unprecedented accuracy, was featured in articles and as the cover story of Science magazine's June issue.  And in July, we announced the latest version of our DRAGEN software for analysis of next-generation sequencing data. DRAGEN 4.2 expands award-winning accuracy combined with flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data. It improves identification of the causes of genetic disease and further aids in both drug discovery and population genomics analysis.  While the year hasn't progressed the way we expected, we remain focused on execution, innovation, and supporting our customers as they ramp their NovaSeq X instruments. We continue to progress on margin improvement while prioritizing investment in proprietary technology that generates differentiated products that are valued by our customers and will drive growth.  These include upcoming product launches, including the highly anticipated 25B flow cell for the NovaSeq X, the Illumina Complete Long Reads enrichment assay, and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k, as well as future offerings for emerging markets like proteomics, multiomics, and spatial, where we see opportunities to address researchers' needs and deliver complete, integrated, and accessible workflows.  In short, Illumina will continue to deliver impactful outcomes. We empower researchers and clinicians with the data and technology they need to make life-changing discoveries and decisions for patients.  Our employees take pride in being part of Illumina's mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. And we are the global engine of genomics innovation, positioning us today and in the future to maximize shareholder value.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, and we'll go from there to Q&A. Joydeep?\nJoydeep Goswami: Thank you, Chuck. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023.  I will be discussing non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website.  As Chuck noted, in the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.18 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of 2023 and exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger than expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and up 3% on a constant currency basis.  Non-GAAP net income was $50 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense reduction initiatives, gross margin favorability, and our higher revenue for the quarter.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which increased from 25.8% in Q2 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollars was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in Q2 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings.  Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million.  Moving to segment results. Core Illumina revenue of $1.16 billion was approximately flat year-over-year, or up 2% on a constant currency basis, which included an anticipated reduction from COVID surveillance of approximately 180 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $6 million in total revenue in Q2 2023 compared to $27 million in Q2 2022.  Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $739 million was down 1% year-over-year. Mid-teens growth in clinical led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing was offset by anticipated headwinds impacting research, including an approximately 260 basis point reduction from COVID surveillance, as well as sanctions in Russia, the impact on NovaSeq 6K consumables as customers start to transition to, but before they have fully ramped up on NovaSeq X, and constrained funding impacting many of our customers globally.  Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 3% from Q1 2023 and 9% year-over-year. Research and applied was flat from Q1 and declined 1% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained strong, up 6% from Q1 and 23% year-over-year.  As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. We have been providing this information on the basis of number of sequencing runs, but in the future we will disclose these metrics in terms of gigabases sequenced to better reflect activity trends given the significant increase in output per run enabled by NovaSeq X and NextSeq 1K/2K.  Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $193 million grew 2% year-over-year. Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X more than offset the anticipated decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments globally and NextSeq 550 placements in China, as well as a decrease in MiSeq shipments as customers transition to NextSeq 1K/2K. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers, with shipments growing 8% year-over-year.  Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $134 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, partially offset by lower contributions from codevelopment partnerships.  Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. All regions continued to be impacted by tighter funding and budget pressures that are affecting customers' project planning and purchasing behaviors. Additionally, all regions faced the impact of high throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X, where we saw customers reduce NovaSeq 6K consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X.  As Chuck mentioned, that though anticipated, this effect was magnified by the larger than expected number of NovaSeq X deliveries and a slower than expected ramp of these instruments coming online in Q2. Continued global demand for NovaSeq X instruments and our stronger-than-anticipated supply in Q2 helped offset these factors.  Strong momentum in clinical also continued across the Americas, Europe and AMEA, with consumables shipments to clinical customers in these regions growing just under 20% year-over-year. Europe also benefited from the NIPT reimbursement decision in Germany last year and the national NIPT program in the Netherlands.  Americas revenue of $623 million was down 2% year-over-year, and Europe revenue of $303 million grew 11% year-over-year, or 14% on a constant currency basis.  AMEA revenue of $118 million declined 10% year-over-year, or 6% on a constant currency basis, which included a 14 percentage point impact from sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. As a reminder, these regions also continued to be impacted by the slowdown in COVID surveillance year-over-year.  Greater China revenue of $115 million represented a 3% decrease year-over-year, or a 1% increase on a constant currency basis. In addition to persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that are impacting this region, revenue was negatively impacted by the local competitive landscape, particularly in mid-throughput.  Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.0% decreased 280 basis points year-over-year. primarily driven by lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year, as well as less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and higher field services and installation costs.  Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $531 million were up $12 million year-over-year primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to the acceleration of our expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based compensation.  As a result of the above, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 21.2% in Q2 2023 compared to 24.9% in Q2 2022.  Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $22 million for the quarter grew 83% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri.  GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $174 million and increased $18 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $105 million. Second quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $47 million and free cash flow was $58 million.  We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As you are aware, we have $750 million in convertible debt that matures this month.  Additionally, on July 12, 2023, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac432 million fine on Illumina due to the completion of the GRAIL acquisition during the pendency of the European Commission's review. We plan to issue a guarantee and defer the payment of the fine pending the outcome of the appeal of the EU General Court's ruling that the European Commission has jurisdiction to review the GRAIL acquisition.  Moving now to 2023 guidance. We now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 1%, including Core Illumina revenue that's approximately flat with 2022.  As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions on Russia of approximately 100 basis points, as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates.  GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023.  For fiscal 2023, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 3% year-over-year reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectation, partially offset by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, including in China which also had an increased impact from local competition, primarily affecting mid-throughput.  We also expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline approximately 3% year-over-year, driven predominately by, one, a more persistent impact of funding issues and cautious purchasing behaviors causing project delays; a more meaningful decrease in NovaSeq 6000 sequencing ahead of planned transitions to NovaSeq X, in part due to our higher shipment expectations for NovaSeq X; three, a delay in the expected ramp of consumables on NovaSeq X; and four, a slower than anticipated second-half recovery in China.  We now expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $800,000 to $900,000 per instrument in 2023, NextSeq 550 pull-through in the range of $80,000 to $130,000, and pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We still expect pull through for NextSeq 1K/2K to be within the historical guidance range of $120,000 to $170,000 and MiniSeq pull through is still expected to be within the historical range of $20,000 to $25,000 per instrument.  With regard to Core Illumina sequencing revenue, we expect it to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation.  We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 5% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year and lower gross margins given lower manufacturing volumes and fixed cost leverage. These impacts are partially offset by acceleration of our $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction initiatives spanning headcount, real estate, and other costs that Chuck mentioned earlier.  We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 41% for 2023, which continues to include an approximately $75 million tax expense impact from R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollars hasn't changed, the impact to our effective tax rate in 2023 has increased as a result of our lower earnings.  Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.75 to $0.90 for 2023, which continues to include dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million.  Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to cover guidance for the third quarter of 2023. We expect Q3 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 2% year-over-year to approximately $1.14 billion. This reflects a sequential decrease of approximately 320 basis points from Q2 2023, primarily driven by a sequential decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers continue to transition to NovaSeq X.  For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.10 to $0.15, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 4% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 19%.  I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: The NovaSeq field challenges that you're having in the market, can you talk a little bit about that? How soon can you fix these challenges? What is getting this recovery? And what does that mean for the installs in the third and fourth quarter and maybe even 2024? My question there is, the market sort of freezes to see if these challenges are resolved before taking on more instruments? And then, on the elasticity of demand, clearly, there is significantly more higher dip this year, there's a decline in sequencing consumables versus when we look at the last product launch of NovaSeq 6000. You mentioned a number of factors, but just trying to understand how much of that is due to the challenges that you're facing in the field. And, look, the NovaSeq is definitely selling despite the challenges, so maybe could you just update us on the CEO search as well?\nCharles Dadswell: I've been listening to you guys now for a long time and it's nice to be able to be part of the conversation. So as far as the NovaSeq X, some of the positives of the launch of an instrument of this magnitude are that we've placed more instruments than we thought. It also has some of the biggest software placements that we've ever seen. And it's revolutionary from the ground up.  What we did is we underestimated the amount of time it would ultimately take to bring these instruments online. But our technical teams are working with our customers to bring them up to speed as quickly as we can.\nJoydeep Goswami: Puneet, maybe I'll jump in. A couple of things. First, as you know, with any of these launches of this magnitude, as you go out into the field, and as you start installing it, you find some bugs that you have to go resolve. So what we have seen in Q2 was nothing out of the ordinary. We have actually \u2013 already have fixes for the issues that we have seen and are in the process of deploying these fixes to our customers. So it has meant a little bit of delay in our original expectations of when these instruments would be fully up to speed. But it hasn't changed any of our or our customer expectations on NovaSeq X. And I will also really urge you to consider that it's not all customers that see this. So some customers are fully [Technical Difficulty], while others, as they have experienced these issues, we are really all hands on deck to go fix these issues in the field.  The other thing is that you talked about elasticity in terms of volume increase and sequencing volume increase. Look, we're not seeing any fundamental change to elasticity. The issues that you've seen are more related to transition to the X. So what we have seen is because of the larger number of Xs installed in the in the area because we moved up some of the supply of Xs, we have seen that the decline in the 6k consumables has been faster and larger than we had expected. Again, this is the flip side of people really being excited about the X and our ability to deliver more Xs.  So that's what has happened. It's a temporary decline. And we expect that as we ramp up fully on the on the Xs that that volume will come back on in terms of X consumables. But what you're seeing now is this timing gap that we have between those two events.  And you said something about \u2013 I think there was \u2013 whether these challenges on the X are continuing or they'll cause a stall in the market. actually, they haven't caused a stall in the market. We have seen demand for the X and our late stage pipeline continue to ramp up. As Chuck mentioned in his prepared remarks that we have seen the X actually enable experiments and solutions that were not hitherto possible.  So we do see continued interest in the X and the continued interest in doing things that were not possible before.  And, Chuck, I'll turn it back over to you to for the CEO search.\nCharles Dadswell: In regards to the CEO search, the board's actively searching for our new CEO. The search includes both internal and external candidates. They've been really encouraged about the outstanding quality of candidates they're seeing. But, of course, you know that the details of the board's processes on this are confidential. We'll be able to update you as soon as we can.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Maybe a couple here packed into one, I guess. The $25 billion flow cell, is that still on track? When will that ship, given some of the issues that you've cited?  Second part, China. China actually grew in the quarter, but I know you called out some pressure there. So kind of what's baked in now for China in the back half of the year.  Third part would be, reference customer challenges throughout which obviously the broader tool spaces that are really challenging second quarter, but that said, the academic and government end market has actually been pretty robust outside of China. So I'm wondering if you can discuss a little bit where are you seeing these challenges?  And then the final point would just be on the NovaSeq consumable pull-through card, and you're mentioning customers are switching faster over to the X. I guess, how do we get comfortable that you're not seeing some either competitive impact or some dampening of utilization, I guess. Kind of what was different this time around, do you think, in terms of your forecasting versus [indiscernible] management forecasted during the last cycle?\nCharles Dadswell: I think, first, we continue to prioritize our investments. They're proprietary and we still continue to focus on the differentiation of products. We probably have the biggest and the best proprietary pipeline in the industry. And we continue to lean on it.  The 25b flow cell remains on track for launch in second half of 2023. We continue to push forward on the Illumina CLR enrichment assay. That's particularly compelling when you're using it with the 25B flow cell. We continue to move forward on the X-LEAP SBS chemistry for NovaSeq 1k/2k. And we're going to have future offerings for emerging markets for things like proteomics, multiomics, and spatial\nJoydeep Goswami: Maybe I'll jump in on China, right. So, yes, we did see, like other companies, a slower than expected recovery in the second half of the year. Remember, we had expected China in the first half of the year to be somewhat soft and recovering from the COVID challenges. And then we had expected an acceleration in that recovery in the second half of the year.  We do not currently see that happening, both because of some of the challenges that you've seen in the broader economy in China, but also for us from an increased competitive intensity that we are seeing in China in the mid throughput and low throughput segments.  Your second part of the question was on the everything ex-China, right? So, there it's a \u2013 I don't think the situation is dire as it was in last year. What we are seeing is a little bit of conservatism, given the economic uncertainty in the speed at which people are coming back online or purchasing. So we have seen a little bit of lengthening of cycles in terms of purchasing behavior, both on our instrument side for mid throughput and low throughput and also on some of the consumables pieces.  Activity, as I indicated, remains strong, but it's just that any newer projects and newer instruments that are coming in are slower than we had expected. Our win rate in \u2013 and we track this pretty closely \u2013 in terms of both mid throughput and, of course, on the high throughput side remains high. In fact, it picked up slightly compared to Q1 in Q2. So, again, I think it's more of a lengthening out of cycles and purchasing cycles, rather than anything related to competitive intensity on those fronts.  On the X, the issue is not competition at all. As I indicated, we are seeing continued strong interest and strong interest from, of course, our existing customers, but also new newer customers or people that are moving up from mid throughput. We continue to see that our ability to actually deliver on the instruments continues to maintain that interest.  As Chuck mentioned, in terms of what these instruments are enabling, there's a whole new set of experiments that are on a larger scale going forward. Again, this is a lead indicator for us. Obviously, people have not ramped up on the X fully. But it is a lot about transitioning to the X and being able to take advantage of the many capabilities that it's providing beyond just the price aspect of it. So the DRAGEN onboard, the faster capabilities, the simplicity of the workflow, obviously, the ambient ship reagents. So there's a lot that goes into that, beyond just the focus on, oh, it's going to help us with the lower price per Gb.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Joydeep, obviously, quite a few moving parts here on the top line and the OpEx line. And it looks like what you're doing in terms of cost reduction and expense management is part of a multiyear effort. I guess, given where this year is headed, how are you thinking about op margins next year for the core business relative to the 25% target that you talked about last quarter? \nJoydeep Goswami: A couple of things. So, one, you're right, we started off as we committed to in our Q1 earnings call. We started off a broad look at cost structure. And actually at the end of Q1, we proceeded with beginning a cost reset that we have executed on and actually have taken out on a run rate basis more than $100 million annually of cost.  During the second half of the year, just given some of the uncertainties in the broader economic space, we continue to keep a very close eye on managing expenses and being very careful about allocating expenses to the highest return areas, including the innovation areas that that Chuck talked about.  Given the challenges we are having this year, obviously, we acknowledge that getting to margins next year is going to seem like a stretch, but we remain very committed to planning for and delivering on those margins. And that's the way we're moving forward.\nOperator: And we have a question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: I had a two part question. Mostly on the guidance here. I think, third quarter, you said 3%. Your comps for fourth quarter look pretty easy. And historically, when I've looked at your sequential revenue ramp from second quarter, it's always been up. Now look at your second quarter trends sequentially, instruments are up, consumables are up, your pull-through per box is up, China was up. So, anything incremental headwinds that we should be thinking about for the back half? Why your back half shouldn't follow historical patterns?  And I think a related question here. You mentioned 800,000 to 900,000 pull through on the Nova 6k. I think there's been some concern. The pull through on the NovaSeq X perhaps might be lower because of the lower sample price point. Maybe can you just walk us through your assumptions around pull through for the Nova X? Could we perhaps see a rebound because I'm assuming inventory levels here for customers are pretty low and they need to restock?\nJoydeep Goswami: That was a long, multipart question. So let me let me try to get to unpack some of that. So first of all, for the full year guidance, given that it has come down, the components roughly fall into three categories. About 25% of the reduction kin guidance really comes from China. And as I mentioned earlier, for China, that's a two part thing. We are seeing a slower than expected recovery in the larger economy, including some liquidity challenges for mainly our clinical customers. And we are seeing a higher competitive intensity that affect the mid throughput and low throughput segments. That's 25%.  The other 75% is roughly equally split into two buckets. So one part is around the transition to the X and the gap we are seeing in terms of the high throughput consumables, right? And this is an issue of the 6k consumables going down pretty rapidly as people are planning to transition to the X and again exacerbate it somewhat by the larger number of Xs we are delivering. And the other part is a slightly slower than expected ramp up on the full utilization of the X.  The other 50% of that 75% is coming from some of the customer conservatism that we're seeing in terms of longer sales cycles and slower than expected recovery across the board beyond China.  So now second quarter versus the first quarter and then third quarter versus second quarter, so we did see a ramp up from first quarter and the second quarter across many dimensions. Obviously, we shipped more Xs. So we saw a jump on the instrument side. We did see a healthy ramp up on our 6k consumables, primarily driven by the clinical segment.  And you're right, we did actually see a jump from Q1 to Q2 in China. But that was expected given China was really depressed for us and other companies in Q1.  Moving on to Q3, what you're seeing in some of the sequential ramp down, there are two big reasons for it, right? One, the aforementioned 6k consumable reduction is going to hit sort of a local maxima there because of the larger transition expected to the X. So we're shipping more Xs. That impact on the 6k consumables is going to ramp up. And we don't yet have a full ramp up on our X consumables yet, right? We expect that in Q4, and I'll come back to that.  And the other piece is we do expect China to actually be down slightly from Q2, again, because of the expectation that the recovery is proceeding unfortunately more slowly than we had expected.  And then, the last piece around that, and just we do expect Q4 to be up significantly, and Q4 is the first quarter you actually start seeing the X consumables come in. You see your traditional end of the year ramp up in some of the spend from company. So you are still seeing that, and that's built into our guidance.  The last thing you mentioned was about pull through. By the way, we have not given you pull through on X. As with all new instruments, we'll only come out with that once the instrument ramp up has stayed stabilized. So we do expect, given the interest in X and the kinds of cohort studies and experiments that our customers are telling us they want to do on X, we do expect that our initial assumptions and pull through are still justified. On the NovaSeq 6000, which is probably what you were referring to, we have called down our pull through numbers for this year. But that is really driven by the transition to the X and the larger than expected impact of that transition that I've talked about.\nOperator: And we'll take a question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. \nTejas Savant: One, Chuck, for you on the leadership changes here. Perhaps, Joydeep, feel free to chime in as well. Dan asked about sort of margins and your commitment to 25% and you call that sort of stretchy, but something that you're certainly committed to. Would that sort of framing apply to your mid-teens girls that you talked about at the analyst day as well for Core Illumina.  Chuck, for you on the leadership changes, beyond sort of the CEO seat, obviously, the CTO and CMO search is underway as well. Any color you can share there on the thought process behind that? On the base business itself, on the NovaSeq, placements here for the X clearly came in, I think it was 28 to 30 units above the piece where we were, but sequencing instrument revenue beat us by only about 5% to 6%. Right? So the question really is, are you seeing more aggressive discounting? Is that something Illumina is pushing through in response to the macroenvironment? You called out sort of BGI starting to be sort of competitive in China, but just any color on just the pricing dynamics on the instrument side would be helpful as well.\nCharles Dadswell: On the executive team and on the process here, so I think the first thing we want to do is just both thank Alex and Phil for all the things that they've done for Illumina. With Alex, what we know is that he's moving on to a new role. He'll be taking the CEO in another company. And I think that we should be really proud to see the kind of leaderships that we grow out of Illumina. So Alex started with Illumina, went over to GRAIL, he came back to Illumina and now he's going to land as a CEO. And we're all looking forward to kind of where that's going to be.  We have a really deep bench in our R&D program. And it's really heartening to see employee number four, Steve Barnard, who is the first scientist the company ever hired, bringing him into that role. He knows the technology, he knows the team, and he'll be able to seamlessly pick up where Alex left off.  On the Chief Medical Officer, we're going to take some time and look at that organization. We're going to evaluate where we are on the clinical side and on the medical side. Our commitment to our clinical customers, our clinical markets, and our clinical programs continues, and we'll open up that search after we have some time to examine exactly where that organization fits and what we need.\nJoydeep Goswami: Picking up on your other questions, first of all, in terms of margins and the implied long term growth in mid-teens, look, the long term growth in mid-teens \u2013 by the way, our expectations on that have not changed and that, as you know, underpinned on two things. One, a large and growing market that NGS is still under penetrated in and the ability then by \u2013 through our innovations addressing the core needs of that market for NGS and Illumina to take an ever growing share. And that then manifests itself in the sequencing volume growth along the three dimensions I had mentioned earlier, first around ever increasing number of samples, again, more cohorts and things like spatial and single cell really driving more of that. The increasing number of analyses per sample. So again, that's really being driven by NGS being able to handle more of the multiomics side of the questions that our customers are asking. And lastly, just the higher sequencing intensity, right? So as you move towards larger panels, as you do more things in liquid biopsy, or things like MRD. So all those remain intact.  I think where we are really looking for in the next year or so, as X kind of comes online and enables a lot of these moves into things that we talked about, how quickly does that ramp take place? But in the long term, nothing of what we had guided to really has changed in our mind, and we are looking forward to seeing how the X kind of evolves us down that path.  You had asked two other questions. So one was around \u2013 the X and the revenue growth on the instrument side not being that high. As I mentioned, right, so we are very pleased that we were able to deliver on the X and ramp up our supply much faster than expected. I think it's a good thing in the long run.  What offset that higher number of Xs was two things that I mentioned earlier. So, one, we did see on the China side that we did have a lower than expected number of mid-throughput and low throughput instruments. And in general, overall, given some of the lengthening of the purchasing cycles, we did see a lower than expected mid-throughput and low throughput instrument sales across the world. Now, unlike as in China where competitive intensity was a factor, in the rest of the world, we actually did not see our win rate go down. We actually saw it climb a little bit in Q2.  Also, with respect to pricing, we track this very closely, right? So in China, yes, we are being very surgical about when to use price and given the type of customer. But we did see a price decline overall in China. In the rest of the world, our price actually remains on track to where we expected it to be. And we're proceeding along what we wanted to do with \u2013 using price as a means to encourage faster adoption of our technologies. \nOperator: And our next question is from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\nSung Ji Nam: Just a clarification question in terms of the cautious purchasing behavior, is that more for your academic customers? Or is it also across clinical as well? And then sorry if I missed it, but what percentage, I guess, of the consumable delay in purchases is attributable to the launch of the higher density, the 25B, and kind of waiting for the better economics in terms of sequencing?\nJoydeep Goswami: The cautious purchasing behavior, again, broadly, ex of China is across both academic and clinical segments, right? The reasons are slightly different. I think a lot of our clinical customers are not profit making companies. So they are managing their cash as you would expect them to. And while they continue to have sequencing at their core, we have seen that their purchasing intensity has come off less quickly than we had expected it to.  In terms of your second question on how much of a delay is there for 25B, I don't think there's a delay in 25B. So what I was trying to articulate is, the reset in guidance for the whole year, about 25% of that came from the impact from China, the other 75%, about 50% of that 75% really came down to this impact on high throughput consumables due to the transition on X. So that includes, as I said, more transition on the 6k faster and then a little bit of a delay, given some of the issues I had mentioned in Q2 that we're already deploying solutions in the field. There's a little bit of delay that is that is flowing through in 2023.\nOperator: And we have a question from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: First up on guidance, you cut revenue growth by 750 basis points at the midpoint for the year. You've walked through a few of the moving pieces between more cautious CapEx environment in China and then some of these lower consumables as customers are transitioning to the new platform. So can you just give us a more granular breakdown from that 750 basis point cut? How is it really broken out across those three areas?  As a follow up, I just want to follow up on some of the earlier comments on China, just mainly relating to some of these stimulus packages. We've heard that there could potentially be another tranche of stimulus in 4Q. So what are you hearing regarding stimulus packages? I know you guys weren't seeing much of the benefit in 1Q, but did you see anything in 2Q? And then how is stimulus contemplated in guidance for the back half of the year? \nJoydeep Goswami: I mentioned the breakdowns earlier. So very quickly, Rachel, I think about 25% of that guidance reset is really coming from the impact from China. Of the remaining 75%, approximately 50% of that 75% really was coming from the impact on high throughput consumables related to the transition to the X. And then the other 50% is some of the cash conservatism that we're seeing with customers outside of China. Right? So that's roughly how we see the math working out. In China, first of all, there is no stimulus built into our expectations for the second half of the year. There never was in our guidance as well. As far as we could see, the stimulus in the first half of the year benefited more of the industrial segments, which we don't play in. And there is no \u2013 we didn't see any stimulus in the second half \u2013 sorry, the second quarter either, right? So it's consistent. We've not built it in and we hadn't initially as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Sourbeer with UBS.\nJohn Sourbeer: Maybe just a couple of clarifications. So appreciate confirming the long term guidance in the mid-teens. It does sound, though, that some of the China headwinds there could be structural with some of the competition increases there. I guess, just has the long term outlook for that market change at all?  Just follow up here, just on the complete long reads, any color there? What you're seeing the demand for that launch?\nJoydeep Goswami: Let me take those in order. So, I think for China in terms of the long term outlook, I think China remains an important market for us. And we are committed to serving our customers in China. Our brand in China actually is very positive. And again, we remain committed to serving that market.  Now, again, given some of the changes we're seeing, we will continue to kind of refine our strategy in terms of how we go to market there, the kinds of partners we choose in order to reach the relevant segments, the highest growing segments of the market better and more efficiently. So none of that has changed. But we continue to observe how China is going to evolve from its current condition as most other people in our space are. In terms of the Illumina complete long reads, so the interest on that has been very high, right? We have a large number of customers that have taken the current WGS product, and are working on it. I think really we have always anticipated that the real jump into this technology would come from the enrichment product, which we are on track to delivering, but that also is coupled because of the economics involved in it, really coupled with the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So that is still coming through towards the end of this year and really pick up as we go into 2024. \nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz : Thank you again for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023.  I will be discussing non-GAAP results which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website.  As Chuck noted, in the second quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.18 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of 2023 and exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger than expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and up 3% on a constant currency basis.  Non-GAAP net income was $50 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, which includes dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense reduction initiatives, gross margin favorability, and our higher revenue for the quarter.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which increased from 25.8% in Q2 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollars was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in Q2 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings.  Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million.  Moving to segment results. Core Illumina revenue of $1.16 billion was approximately flat year-over-year, or up 2% on a constant currency basis, which included an anticipated reduction from COVID surveillance of approximately 180 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $6 million in total revenue in Q2 2023 compared to $27 million in Q2 2022.  Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $739 million was down 1% year-over-year. Mid-teens growth in clinical led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing was offset by anticipated headwinds impacting research, including an approximately 260 basis point reduction from COVID surveillance, as well as sanctions in Russia, the impact on NovaSeq 6K consumables as customers start to transition to, but before they have fully ramped up on NovaSeq X, and constrained funding impacting many of our customers globally.  Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 3% from Q1 2023 and 9% year-over-year. Research and applied was flat from Q1 and declined 1% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained strong, up 6% from Q1 and 23% year-over-year.  As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. We have been providing this information on the basis of number of sequencing runs, but in the future we will disclose these metrics in terms of gigabases sequenced to better reflect activity trends given the significant increase in output per run enabled by NovaSeq X and NextSeq 1K/2K.  Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $193 million grew 2% year-over-year. Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X more than offset the anticipated decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments globally and NextSeq 550 placements in China, as well as a decrease in MiSeq shipments as customers transition to NextSeq 1K/2K. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers, with shipments growing 8% year-over-year.  Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $134 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, partially offset by lower contributions from codevelopment partnerships.  Moving to regional results for Core Illumina. All regions continued to be impacted by tighter funding and budget pressures that are affecting customers' project planning and purchasing behaviors. Additionally, all regions faced the impact of high throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X, where we saw customers reduce NovaSeq 6K consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X.  As Chuck mentioned, that though anticipated, this effect was magnified by the larger than expected number of NovaSeq X deliveries and a slower than expected ramp of these instruments coming online in Q2. Continued global demand for NovaSeq X instruments and our stronger-than-anticipated supply in Q2 helped offset these factors.  Strong momentum in clinical also continued across the Americas, Europe and AMEA, with consumables shipments to clinical customers in these regions growing just under 20% year-over-year. Europe also benefited from the NIPT reimbursement decision in Germany last year and the national NIPT program in the Netherlands.  Americas revenue of $623 million was down 2% year-over-year, and Europe revenue of $303 million grew 11% year-over-year, or 14% on a constant currency basis.  AMEA revenue of $118 million declined 10% year-over-year, or 6% on a constant currency basis, which included a 14 percentage point impact from sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. As a reminder, these regions also continued to be impacted by the slowdown in COVID surveillance year-over-year.  Greater China revenue of $115 million represented a 3% decrease year-over-year, or a 1% increase on a constant currency basis. In addition to persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that are impacting this region, revenue was negatively impacted by the local competitive landscape, particularly in mid-throughput.  Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.0% decreased 280 basis points year-over-year. primarily driven by lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year, as well as less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and higher field services and installation costs.  Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $531 million were up $12 million year-over-year primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to the acceleration of our expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based compensation.  As a result of the above, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 21.2% in Q2 2023 compared to 24.9% in Q2 2022.  Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $22 million for the quarter grew 83% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri.  GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $174 million and increased $18 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.  Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $105 million. Second quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $47 million and free cash flow was $58 million.  We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As you are aware, we have $750 million in convertible debt that matures this month.  Additionally, on July 12, 2023, the European Commission imposed a \u20ac432 million fine on Illumina due to the completion of the GRAIL acquisition during the pendency of the European Commission's review. We plan to issue a guarantee and defer the payment of the fine pending the outcome of the appeal of the EU General Court's ruling that the European Commission has jurisdiction to review the GRAIL acquisition.  Moving now to 2023 guidance. We now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 1%, including Core Illumina revenue that's approximately flat with 2022.  As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions on Russia of approximately 100 basis points, as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates.  GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023.  For fiscal 2023, we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 3% year-over-year reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectation, partially offset by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, including in China which also had an increased impact from local competition, primarily affecting mid-throughput.  We also expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline approximately 3% year-over-year, driven predominately by, one, a more persistent impact of funding issues and cautious purchasing behaviors causing project delays; a more meaningful decrease in NovaSeq 6000 sequencing ahead of planned transitions to NovaSeq X, in part due to our higher shipment expectations for NovaSeq X; three, a delay in the expected ramp of consumables on NovaSeq X; and four, a slower than anticipated second-half recovery in China.  We now expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $800,000 to $900,000 per instrument in 2023, NextSeq 550 pull-through in the range of $80,000 to $130,000, and pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We still expect pull through for NextSeq 1K/2K to be within the historical guidance range of $120,000 to $170,000 and MiniSeq pull through is still expected to be within the historical range of $20,000 to $25,000 per instrument.  With regard to Core Illumina sequencing revenue, we expect it to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation.  We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 5% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year and lower gross margins given lower manufacturing volumes and fixed cost leverage. These impacts are partially offset by acceleration of our $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction initiatives spanning headcount, real estate, and other costs that Chuck mentioned earlier.  We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 41% for 2023, which continues to include an approximately $75 million tax expense impact from R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollars hasn't changed, the impact to our effective tax rate in 2023 has increased as a result of our lower earnings.  Lastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.75 to $0.90 for 2023, which continues to include dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $670 million.  Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to cover guidance for the third quarter of 2023. We expect Q3 2023 consolidated revenue to grow approximately 2% year-over-year to approximately $1.14 billion. This reflects a sequential decrease of approximately 320 basis points from Q2 2023, primarily driven by a sequential decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers continue to transition to NovaSeq X.  For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.10 to $0.15, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 4% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 19%.  I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you. Puneet, maybe I'll jump in. A couple of things. First, as you know, with any of these launches of this magnitude, as you go out into the field, and as you start installing it, you find some bugs that you have to go resolve. So what we have seen in Q2 was nothing out of the ordinary. We have actually \u2013 already have fixes for the issues that we have seen and are in the process of deploying these fixes to our customers. So it has meant a little bit of delay in our original expectations of when these instruments would be fully up to speed. But it hasn't changed any of our or our customer expectations on NovaSeq X. And I will also really urge you to consider that it's not all customers that see this. So some customers are fully [Technical Difficulty], while others, as they have experienced these issues, we are really all hands on deck to go fix these issues in the field.  The other thing is that you talked about elasticity in terms of volume increase and sequencing volume increase. Look, we're not seeing any fundamental change to elasticity. The issues that you've seen are more related to transition to the X. So what we have seen is because of the larger number of Xs installed in the in the area because we moved up some of the supply of Xs, we have seen that the decline in the 6k consumables has been faster and larger than we had expected. Again, this is the flip side of people really being excited about the X and our ability to deliver more Xs.  So that's what has happened. It's a temporary decline. And we expect that as we ramp up fully on the on the Xs that that volume will come back on in terms of X consumables. But what you're seeing now is this timing gap that we have between those two events.  And you said something about \u2013 I think there was \u2013 whether these challenges on the X are continuing or they'll cause a stall in the market. actually, they haven't caused a stall in the market. We have seen demand for the X and our late stage pipeline continue to ramp up. As Chuck mentioned in his prepared remarks that we have seen the X actually enable experiments and solutions that were not hitherto possible.  So we do see continued interest in the X and the continued interest in doing things that were not possible before.  And, Chuck, I'll turn it back over to you to for the CEO search. Maybe I'll jump in on China, right. So, yes, we did see, like other companies, a slower than expected recovery in the second half of the year. Remember, we had expected China in the first half of the year to be somewhat soft and recovering from the COVID challenges. And then we had expected an acceleration in that recovery in the second half of the year.  We do not currently see that happening, both because of some of the challenges that you've seen in the broader economy in China, but also for us from an increased competitive intensity that we are seeing in China in the mid throughput and low throughput segments.  Your second part of the question was on the everything ex-China, right? So, there it's a \u2013 I don't think the situation is dire as it was in last year. What we are seeing is a little bit of conservatism, given the economic uncertainty in the speed at which people are coming back online or purchasing. So we have seen a little bit of lengthening of cycles in terms of purchasing behavior, both on our instrument side for mid throughput and low throughput and also on some of the consumables pieces.  Activity, as I indicated, remains strong, but it's just that any newer projects and newer instruments that are coming in are slower than we had expected. Our win rate in \u2013 and we track this pretty closely \u2013 in terms of both mid throughput and, of course, on the high throughput side remains high. In fact, it picked up slightly compared to Q1 in Q2. So, again, I think it's more of a lengthening out of cycles and purchasing cycles, rather than anything related to competitive intensity on those fronts.  On the X, the issue is not competition at all. As I indicated, we are seeing continued strong interest and strong interest from, of course, our existing customers, but also new newer customers or people that are moving up from mid throughput. We continue to see that our ability to actually deliver on the instruments continues to maintain that interest.  As Chuck mentioned, in terms of what these instruments are enabling, there's a whole new set of experiments that are on a larger scale going forward. Again, this is a lead indicator for us. Obviously, people have not ramped up on the X fully. But it is a lot about transitioning to the X and being able to take advantage of the many capabilities that it's providing beyond just the price aspect of it. So the DRAGEN onboard, the faster capabilities, the simplicity of the workflow, obviously, the ambient ship reagents. So there's a lot that goes into that, beyond just the focus on, oh, it's going to help us with the lower price per Gb. A couple of things. So, one, you're right, we started off as we committed to in our Q1 earnings call. We started off a broad look at cost structure. And actually at the end of Q1, we proceeded with beginning a cost reset that we have executed on and actually have taken out on a run rate basis more than $100 million annually of cost.  During the second half of the year, just given some of the uncertainties in the broader economic space, we continue to keep a very close eye on managing expenses and being very careful about allocating expenses to the highest return areas, including the innovation areas that that Chuck talked about.  Given the challenges we are having this year, obviously, we acknowledge that getting to margins next year is going to seem like a stretch, but we remain very committed to planning for and delivering on those margins. And that's the way we're moving forward. That was a long, multipart question. So let me let me try to get to unpack some of that. So first of all, for the full year guidance, given that it has come down, the components roughly fall into three categories. About 25% of the reduction kin guidance really comes from China. And as I mentioned earlier, for China, that's a two part thing. We are seeing a slower than expected recovery in the larger economy, including some liquidity challenges for mainly our clinical customers. And we are seeing a higher competitive intensity that affect the mid throughput and low throughput segments. That's 25%.  The other 75% is roughly equally split into two buckets. So one part is around the transition to the X and the gap we are seeing in terms of the high throughput consumables, right? And this is an issue of the 6k consumables going down pretty rapidly as people are planning to transition to the X and again exacerbate it somewhat by the larger number of Xs we are delivering. And the other part is a slightly slower than expected ramp up on the full utilization of the X.  The other 50% of that 75% is coming from some of the customer conservatism that we're seeing in terms of longer sales cycles and slower than expected recovery across the board beyond China.  So now second quarter versus the first quarter and then third quarter versus second quarter, so we did see a ramp up from first quarter and the second quarter across many dimensions. Obviously, we shipped more Xs. So we saw a jump on the instrument side. We did see a healthy ramp up on our 6k consumables, primarily driven by the clinical segment.  And you're right, we did actually see a jump from Q1 to Q2 in China. But that was expected given China was really depressed for us and other companies in Q1.  Moving on to Q3, what you're seeing in some of the sequential ramp down, there are two big reasons for it, right? One, the aforementioned 6k consumable reduction is going to hit sort of a local maxima there because of the larger transition expected to the X. So we're shipping more Xs. That impact on the 6k consumables is going to ramp up. And we don't yet have a full ramp up on our X consumables yet, right? We expect that in Q4, and I'll come back to that.  And the other piece is we do expect China to actually be down slightly from Q2, again, because of the expectation that the recovery is proceeding unfortunately more slowly than we had expected.  And then, the last piece around that, and just we do expect Q4 to be up significantly, and Q4 is the first quarter you actually start seeing the X consumables come in. You see your traditional end of the year ramp up in some of the spend from company. So you are still seeing that, and that's built into our guidance.  The last thing you mentioned was about pull through. By the way, we have not given you pull through on X. As with all new instruments, we'll only come out with that once the instrument ramp up has stayed stabilized. So we do expect, given the interest in X and the kinds of cohort studies and experiments that our customers are telling us they want to do on X, we do expect that our initial assumptions and pull through are still justified. On the NovaSeq 6000, which is probably what you were referring to, we have called down our pull through numbers for this year. But that is really driven by the transition to the X and the larger than expected impact of that transition that I've talked about. Picking up on your other questions, first of all, in terms of margins and the implied long term growth in mid-teens, look, the long term growth in mid-teens \u2013 by the way, our expectations on that have not changed and that, as you know, underpinned on two things. One, a large and growing market that NGS is still under penetrated in and the ability then by \u2013 through our innovations addressing the core needs of that market for NGS and Illumina to take an ever growing share. And that then manifests itself in the sequencing volume growth along the three dimensions I had mentioned earlier, first around ever increasing number of samples, again, more cohorts and things like spatial and single cell really driving more of that. The increasing number of analyses per sample. So again, that's really being driven by NGS being able to handle more of the multiomics side of the questions that our customers are asking. And lastly, just the higher sequencing intensity, right? So as you move towards larger panels, as you do more things in liquid biopsy, or things like MRD. So all those remain intact.  I think where we are really looking for in the next year or so, as X kind of comes online and enables a lot of these moves into things that we talked about, how quickly does that ramp take place? But in the long term, nothing of what we had guided to really has changed in our mind, and we are looking forward to seeing how the X kind of evolves us down that path.  You had asked two other questions. So one was around \u2013 the X and the revenue growth on the instrument side not being that high. As I mentioned, right, so we are very pleased that we were able to deliver on the X and ramp up our supply much faster than expected. I think it's a good thing in the long run.  What offset that higher number of Xs was two things that I mentioned earlier. So, one, we did see on the China side that we did have a lower than expected number of mid-throughput and low throughput instruments. And in general, overall, given some of the lengthening of the purchasing cycles, we did see a lower than expected mid-throughput and low throughput instrument sales across the world. Now, unlike as in China where competitive intensity was a factor, in the rest of the world, we actually did not see our win rate go down. We actually saw it climb a little bit in Q2.  Also, with respect to pricing, we track this very closely, right? So in China, yes, we are being very surgical about when to use price and given the type of customer. But we did see a price decline overall in China. In the rest of the world, our price actually remains on track to where we expected it to be. And we're proceeding along what we wanted to do with \u2013 using price as a means to encourage faster adoption of our technologies. The cautious purchasing behavior, again, broadly, ex of China is across both academic and clinical segments, right? The reasons are slightly different. I think a lot of our clinical customers are not profit making companies. So they are managing their cash as you would expect them to. And while they continue to have sequencing at their core, we have seen that their purchasing intensity has come off less quickly than we had expected it to.  In terms of your second question on how much of a delay is there for 25B, I don't think there's a delay in 25B. So what I was trying to articulate is, the reset in guidance for the whole year, about 25% of that came from the impact from China, the other 75%, about 50% of that 75% really came down to this impact on high throughput consumables due to the transition on X. So that includes, as I said, more transition on the 6k faster and then a little bit of a delay, given some of the issues I had mentioned in Q2 that we're already deploying solutions in the field. There's a little bit of delay that is that is flowing through in 2023. I mentioned the breakdowns earlier. So very quickly, Rachel, I think about 25% of that guidance reset is really coming from the impact from China. Of the remaining 75%, approximately 50% of that 75% really was coming from the impact on high throughput consumables related to the transition to the X. And then the other 50% is some of the cash conservatism that we're seeing with customers outside of China. Right? So that's roughly how we see the math working out. In China, first of all, there is no stimulus built into our expectations for the second half of the year. There never was in our guidance as well. As far as we could see, the stimulus in the first half of the year benefited more of the industrial segments, which we don't play in. And there is no \u2013 we didn't see any stimulus in the second half \u2013 sorry, the second quarter either, right? So it's consistent. We've not built it in and we hadn't initially as well. Let me take those in order. So, I think for China in terms of the long term outlook, I think China remains an important market for us. And we are committed to serving our customers in China. Our brand in China actually is very positive. And again, we remain committed to serving that market.  Now, again, given some of the changes we're seeing, we will continue to kind of refine our strategy in terms of how we go to market there, the kinds of partners we choose in order to reach the relevant segments, the highest growing segments of the market better and more efficiently. So none of that has changed. But we continue to observe how China is going to evolve from its current condition as most other people in our space are. In terms of the Illumina complete long reads, so the interest on that has been very high, right? We have a large number of customers that have taken the current WGS product, and are working on it. I think really we have always anticipated that the real jump into this technology would come from the enrichment product, which we are on track to delivering, but that also is coupled because of the economics involved in it, really coupled with the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So that is still coming through towards the end of this year and really pick up as we go into 2024."

            "name": "Charles Dadswell",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role of Illumina's interim CEO two months ago. Our search for a CEO is underway, and we look forward to updating you soon. Our Board is pleased with the outstanding candidates they are seeing.  Before going into our second quarter results, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our former CEO, Francis deSouza, and our former Chairman of the Board, John Thompson, for their thoughtfulness and commitment while at Illumina. I would also like to welcome our new Board members, Stephen MacMillan, our new Chairman of the Board, as well as Andrew Teno and Scott Ullem.  I also wanted to acknowledge changes in our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Technology Officer, Alex Aravanis, and our Chief Medical Officer, Phil Febbo. I speak for the whole company in wishing both of them every success in the future.  We also are pleased to announce that Steve Barnard, a 25-year Illumina employee and distinguished scientist in our field, will drive Illumina's legacy of innovation forward as our next Chief Technology Officer. We will be conducting a search for our next Chief Medical Officer.  Turning to our second quarter results: In Q2, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.18 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.32, both ahead of the guidance we provided in Q1. We shipped 109 NovaSeq X instruments in the quarter and have increased our expectations for our full year supply capacity to more than 390 instruments.  However, as you saw from our earnings release, we are reducing our guidance, and now expect core Illumina full year 2023 revenue to be approximately flat with 2022, primarily as a result of three factors.  First, a larger-than-expected temporary decline in high throughput consumables as we transition more-than-expected customers to the NovaSeq X. Second, many of our customers are remaining more cautious in their purchasing behaviors. And finally, in China, there is both a more protracted economic recovery and an increasingly challenged competitive landscape, in contrast to the Americas and Europe, where we are still expecting year-over-year growth in 2023. Joydeep will provide additional details on our revised guidance during his remarks.  One area I'd like to touch on further is the rollout of NovaSeq X. This has been a more challenging process than we anticipated. NovaSeq X is the most sophisticated platform we have ever launched and includes the most comprehensive end-to-end software we have ever released. Also, the rollout of the X has occurred at an unprecedented magnitude and pace. And we have identified issues in the field that are typical in new product releases.  To address these issues, we have taken actions including a planned software update that was released in June after our first customer shipment in March. We have deployed Illumina technical teams worldwide to work with our customers to accelerate bringing their systems online.  While the rollout of NovaSeq X will take longer than we originally expected, the continued strong interest and commitment of capital to purchase NovaSeq Xs remains encouraging. To date, 20% of customers who have purchased a NovaSeq X have ordered more than one instrument.  This early demand for multiple instruments and the capacity they represent underscores our confidence that customers are planning to increase their sequencing activity. Customers have clear intentions to do more sequencing in the future: Our customers have commented that larger scale single cell and spatial analysis experiments become more practical with the NovaSeq X, and they are requesting funding for these applications.  Customers engaged in large population genomics initiatives have stated they plan to run additional multiomic programs for population-specific variants, which can be used to develop treatments for various demographics that will be more effective in those populations.  And, as some of you have heard, several of our largest customers are using the X to accelerate the move from targeted panels and exomes to whole genome sequencing. We expect these types of projects to scale and ramp in the near future, and we will be closely engaged with our customers to support their needs.  We continue to consciously and actively reduce our expense base and have accelerated actions within the $100 million-plus annual run rate expense reduction program we announced at our last earnings call.  As you saw in our late June 8K filing, we have reduced our global headcount and are downsizing our global real estate footprint. We also are optimizing our third-party vendor spend and have reduced travel-related and other costs. For 2023, these steps are helping mitigate the impact of lower full-year revenue on our operating margin. Looking forward, these actions will continue to support our margins and create flexibility for further investment in high-growth areas.  Let me give you an update on a couple of our platforms: We saw continued global interest in the NovaSeq X series in Q2, and we exited the quarter with more than 260 orders since launch. Our shipments of 109 NovaSeq X instruments in Q2 were above our expectation of 80 for the quarter and brought our total installed base to 176 instruments. We now expect to be able to ship more than 390 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from the 330 we had previously expected for the year.  In mid-throughput, we shipped approximately 160 NextSeq 1k/2k units in the second quarter, an increase of 8% year-over- year, as customers expanded their current fleets or migrated from the MiSeq or NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q2 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers.  We continue to experience lengthened sales cycles, in some cases as customers take time to raise funding or prioritize their investment dollars, and in other cases as they run longer procurement processes.  Our win rate across the midthroughput segment, outside of China, increased from the first quarter. We believe there is a long runway of differentiation for the 1k/2k, notably with X-LEAP SBS chemistry coming available on these instruments next year.  Moving to our markets. In Q2, clinical represented approximately 53% of our total sequencing consumables revenue. In oncology, progress continued for next generation sequencing-based testing reimbursement.  Anthem, the second largest commercial payer in the US, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, both added coverage for comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with advanced cancers, adding more than 30 million additional covered lives. We also saw coverage continue to progress in Europe, with Switzerland now reimbursing large next generation sequencing panels, including comprehensive genomic profiling.  Illumina's market leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, remains on track to exceed more than $100 million in 2023 revenue. Growth continues to be driven by greater utilization and broader adoption of our assay.  In Q2, we also completed our TSO Comprehensive submission for IVD registration in the United States. Also in oncology, GRAIL continues to achieve solid progress in the adoption of its Galleri multi-cancer early detection test. In Q2, GRAIL achieved its 100,000th commercial Galleri test milestone, and the test has now been prescribed by more than 7,500 providers in the US and ordered in more than 80 health systems.  As an update, on the NHS-Galleri study, in Q2 GRAIL completed second-year follow up visits, in which 130,000 participants returned, giving the trial a retention rate of 91.3%. Invitations for the third and final-year visits have begun, and the first appointments for those visits are expected this fall.  Evidence for Galleri continues to grow. At the most recent annual meeting held by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, GRAIL announced results from the University of Oxford-sponsored SYMPLIFY study, reporting high specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the cancer signal detected and cancer signal origin prediction, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of using an MCED test to assist clinicians with decisions regarding referrals from primary care physicians.  GRAIL is also making progress on its unique multi-cancer minimal residual disease test. At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, GRAIL and AstraZeneca presented new data that supports use of GRAIL's methylation platform to identify residual cancer in post-treatment settings.  GRAIL's technology had a cancer detection rate of 92% in patients with relapsed or refractory disease across six hematological malignancies. These findings demonstrate that GRAIL's blood-based methylation approach offers additional options to clinicians as they evaluate patients in efforts to achieve remission and improve survival.  Returning to core Illumina, in reproductive health, in the US, five state Medicaid programs \u2013 in Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee \u2013 updated their policies and are now covering non-invasive prenatal testing for all pregnancies.  In Europe, NIPT is now available for all pregnancies in the Netherlands and has been approved for broader coverage in Italy.  Turning to our research and applied markets, as we announced in mid-July, the Alliance for Genomic Discovery, launched by Illumina and Nashville Biosciences in 2022, now includes five founding members \u2013 AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, and Merck \u2013 and represents a novel, industry-led collaboration to accelerate development of therapeutics through large-scale genomics. Members will co-fund the whole-genome sequencing of 250,000 samples and all have access to the resulting data for use in drug discovery and therapeutic development.  The first phase in the Alliance was announced in January and involved whole-genome sequencing for 35,000 samples, primarily made up of DNA from individuals of African ancestry.  Before we move to Joydeep and then go to Q&A, I wanted to point out a couple of additional innovations we recently announced. In June, our PrimateAI-3D, an AI algorithm that predicts disease-causing genetic mutations in patients with unprecedented accuracy, was featured in articles and as the cover story of Science magazine's June issue.  And in July, we announced the latest version of our DRAGEN software for analysis of next-generation sequencing data. DRAGEN 4.2 expands award-winning accuracy combined with flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data. It improves identification of the causes of genetic disease and further aids in both drug discovery and population genomics analysis.  While the year hasn't progressed the way we expected, we remain focused on execution, innovation, and supporting our customers as they ramp their NovaSeq X instruments. We continue to progress on margin improvement while prioritizing investment in proprietary technology that generates differentiated products that are valued by our customers and will drive growth.  These include upcoming product launches, including the highly anticipated 25B flow cell for the NovaSeq X, the Illumina Complete Long Reads enrichment assay, and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k, as well as future offerings for emerging markets like proteomics, multiomics, and spatial, where we see opportunities to address researchers' needs and deliver complete, integrated, and accessible workflows.  In short, Illumina will continue to deliver impactful outcomes. We empower researchers and clinicians with the data and technology they need to make life-changing discoveries and decisions for patients.  Our employees take pride in being part of Illumina's mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. And we are the global engine of genomics innovation, positioning us today and in the future to maximize shareholder value.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, and we'll go from there to Q&A. Joydeep? I've been listening to you guys now for a long time and it's nice to be able to be part of the conversation. So as far as the NovaSeq X, some of the positives of the launch of an instrument of this magnitude are that we've placed more instruments than we thought. It also has some of the biggest software placements that we've ever seen. And it's revolutionary from the ground up.  What we did is we underestimated the amount of time it would ultimately take to bring these instruments online. But our technical teams are working with our customers to bring them up to speed as quickly as we can. In regards to the CEO search, the board's actively searching for our new CEO. The search includes both internal and external candidates. They've been really encouraged about the outstanding quality of candidates they're seeing. But, of course, you know that the details of the board's processes on this are confidential. We'll be able to update you as soon as we can. I think, first, we continue to prioritize our investments. They're proprietary and we still continue to focus on the differentiation of products. We probably have the biggest and the best proprietary pipeline in the industry. And we continue to lean on it.  The 25b flow cell remains on track for launch in second half of 2023. We continue to push forward on the Illumina CLR enrichment assay. That's particularly compelling when you're using it with the 25B flow cell. We continue to move forward on the X-LEAP SBS chemistry for NovaSeq 1k/2k. And we're going to have future offerings for emerging markets for things like proteomics, multiomics, and spatial On the executive team and on the process here, so I think the first thing we want to do is just both thank Alex and Phil for all the things that they've done for Illumina. With Alex, what we know is that he's moving on to a new role. He'll be taking the CEO in another company. And I think that we should be really proud to see the kind of leaderships that we grow out of Illumina. So Alex started with Illumina, went over to GRAIL, he came back to Illumina and now he's going to land as a CEO. And we're all looking forward to kind of where that's going to be.  We have a really deep bench in our R&D program. And it's really heartening to see employee number four, Steve Barnard, who is the first scientist the company ever hired, bringing him into that role. He knows the technology, he knows the team, and he'll be able to seamlessly pick up where Alex left off.  On the Chief Medical Officer, we're going to take some time and look at that organization. We're going to evaluate where we are on the clinical side and on the medical side. Our commitment to our clinical customers, our clinical markets, and our clinical programs continues, and we'll open up that search after we have some time to examine exactly where that organization fits and what we need."

Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.09 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 in Q1, both ahead of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year but down year-over-year, as expected. Joydeep will take you through more detail later in the call. Our focus for the rest of the year is to deliver sequential growth primarily by scaling the production and distribution of NovaSeq X, driving elasticity on the back of its increased capabilities, and improving margins. We will share more on each. We achieved key product milestones in Q1, including shipping the first NovaSeq X systems. We also launched Illumina Complete Long Read technology and Illumina Connected Insights, a cloud-based tertiary analysis tool that addresses a key barrier to adoption, and will enable more labs to perform comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced tumors. Turning to our performance across platforms, beginning with high-throughput. The NovaSeq X launch further strengthened Illumina's competitive position in high-throughput sequencing. The strong global interest for the NovaSeq X series continued in Q1 and we exited the quarter with over 200 orders received from more than 30 countries. Clinical demand continued to be stronger than expected, generating approximately 40% of orders, with some customers planning to leverage the NovaSeq X to launch new clinical offerings. About 15% of orders are from new-to-high throughput customers, like the clinical genomics lab that is leveraging NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits to perform high-throughput whole genome, single cell, and RNA sequencing. Our manufacturing capabilities for NovaSeq X instruments and consumables are scaling nicely. We shipped 67 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1, above initial expectations of 40 to 50, and now expect to deliver more than 330 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from 300. Customers' initial runs are showing robust data output and sequencing quality, with some customers reporting outputs greater than 7 terabases and more than 95% of bases above Q30, well ahead of published specifications. As customers take delivery of their NovaSeq Xs and plan their deployments, they are sharing examples about how NovaSeq X will unlock demand elasticity in the sequencing market. Customers are planning to leverage the X's greater output and lower price per sample to sequence more samples, perform more analyses per sample, and obtain more data per analysis. For example, a leading European life science research institute will use NovaSeq X to scale up its data-intensive research programs, specifically in multi-omics, spatial, and single cell, enabling them to deliver \"atlas-scale\" projects. Within our clinical base, customers are using the greater output and cost savings of NovaSeq X to launch new, sequencing-intensive offerings. Some customers are planning to move from targeted panels to exomes and genomes, to achieve higher diagnostic yield and healthcare efficiency. An oncology customer is planning to use the X to launch liquid biopsy testing, which requires 12 to 15 times more sequencing than solid tumor testing. Some customers are using the cost and turnaround time benefits to enter deeper sequencing applications like minimal residual disease, or MRD, to build datasets at scale. We also saw continued demand for NovaSeq 6000, primarily for fleet expansions of existing workflows, and we shipped 17 NovaSeq 6000s in Q1. More than 80% of NovaSeq 6000 shipments were to clinical customers, and approximately 25% of shipments to oncology testing. In mid-throughput, NextSeq 1k/2k unit shipments increased 6% year-over-year, as customers expand their existing fleets, or continue to shift projects from the MiSeq and NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q1 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers. Our win rate in the mid-throughput segment remains strong, but we are seeing some sales cycles lengthen. Our low-throughput platforms continue to provide an entry point to sequencing. Approximately 30% of these shipments in the first quarter were to new-to-Illumina customers, further increasing our installed base and enabling adoption of sequencing across a broad customer network. Looking now at our clinical markets. Q1 marked an important milestone for Illumina, with clinical sequencing consumables revenue representing 50% of our total sequencing consumables revenue for the first time. In Q1, oncology testing consumables declined 3% year-over-year, but increased 21% sequentially, driven by growing clinical testing volumes and increased product development in areas like liquid biopsy and MRD. Some customers in this segment are facing pressures to improve profitability, which may in turn slow down their ability to develop new tests and scale. Revenue from our market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, was greater than $25 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year across more than 540 accounts, driven by increased utilization and pull-through, particularly in Europe. In March, we announced the expansion of our partnership with Myriad Genetics to broaden access to homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, testing. HRD is an important biomarker identifying tumors with a specific type of DNA damage, like those in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Our TSO 500 HRD, a research-use-only test, is now available in the US, with early customers like Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, one of the largest independent medical oncology and hematological practices in the United States. The expanded partnership also establishes a unique alliance to develop HRD as a companion diagnostic for novel agents targeting these tumors. There was significant progress for NGS-based oncology testing reimbursement this quarter in Europe, expanding the accessible market. Seven regions in Italy committed \u20ac10 million for next-generation sequencing in lung cancer. In Germany, health insurers commenced reimbursement for whole genome sequencing in pediatric cancer patients with relapse. And in the Czech Republic, funding for comprehensive genomic profiling was added to the national fee schedule, effective January 1st. Also in oncology, GRAIL saw accelerating demand in Q1 for its Galleri multi-cancer early detection blood test and delivered revenue of $20 million, exceeding plan, and representing 100% growth year-over-year. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $173 million, driven primarily by investments in clinical trials and scaling GRAIL's commercial organization. Since launch, GRAIL has received more than 85,000 Galleri test orders, with about 20,000 delivered in Q1 alone. The 140,000-participant NHS-Galleri trial, which completed enrollment in July 2022 in just over ten months, is progressing well, with more than half of study participants having returned for their second annual blood draw. The trial recently achieved its halfway point and is currently on track to meet retention targets. GRAIL continued to expand its partner relationships. Following a successful pilot last year, John Hancock, one of the largest life insurance companies in the US and a unit of Manulife, announced that it would expand access to Galleri to eligible life insurance customers. And Providence, a health system serving the Western US, expanded its partnership with GRAIL to offer Galleri to eligible individuals across its 52 hospitals and 900 clinics across seven states. In reproductive health, consumables shipments declined 4% year-over-year, primarily due to FX, but increased 14% sequentially due to continued coverage progress. In the US, Virginia and Michigan initiated state Medicaid coverage for NIPT in all pregnancies, adding about 4.3 million additional covered lives and more than 70,000 pregnancies per year. Genetic Disease Testing, or GDT, had a record quarter. In Q1, GDT consumables shipments grew 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Coverage continues to grow for whole genome sequencing in patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases. During the quarter, one of the largest US health insurance companies updated their policy to include Managed Medicaid lives in 16 states, adding another approximately 3.8 million covered lives for whole genome sequencing. Also in GDT, earlier this month we announced a partnership with Henry Ford Health, a health care organization in the Detroit metro area and a leading US academic medical center, to assess how whole-genome sequencing can improve cardiovascular disease management, with a particular interest in diverse and underserved populations. Turning to our Research and Applied markets, sequencing consumables shipments were down 19% year-over-year, primarily due to the slowdown in COVID surveillance. Looking at the whole year, we are on track to deliver on our financial commitments for 2023 as well as some important releases in the coming quarters. Specifically, we will ship the ICLR enrichment assay, an affordable, high throughput, targeted long-read solution, in Q3 and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k in the first half of 2024, delivering step-change cost, speed, and sustainability benefits on that platform. Finally, as we navigate through this dynamic environment, we are focused on delivering durable success for our shareholders through a balance of investing in breakthrough innovations for future growth, while delivering operating leverage through disciplined expense management across the organization. To that end, we announced earlier today our commitment to deliver Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025, while maintaining investment in the key elements of our innovation roadmap. Building on the cost reduction actions announced last November, we are taking additional steps to reduce our annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. This will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, as well as provide more detail on the steps we are taking to deliver on the cost reduction I mentioned. Joydeep?\nJoydeep Goswami: Thank you, Francis. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.09 billion, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was down 11% year-over-year, or down 9% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. This was primarily driven by an expected year-over-year slowdown in COVID surveillance, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally. Non-GAAP net income was $13 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.3% for the quarter, which increased from 17.8% in Q1 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollar terms was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in quarter one 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results: Core Illumina revenue of $1.08 billion was down 12% year-over-year, which included an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 400 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $11 million in total revenue in Q1 2023 compared to $60 million in Q1 2022, reflecting a $49 million headwind. On a constant currency basis, Core Illumina revenue was down 10%, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $692 million was up 1% sequentially, but down 12% year-over-year, which included an approximately 500 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. In addition to the slowdown in COVID surveillance, the year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to lower NovaSeq 6000 consumables pull-through due to the headwinds I mentioned earlier, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally. Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 6% from Q4 2022 and 3% year-over-year. Research & Applied grew 7% from Q4 2022 and declined 4% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from Q4 2022 and 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $154 million declined 27% year-over-year, including a 300 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. As expected, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments compared to a record Q1 2022, and a decrease in mid-throughput shipments due primarily to fewer NextSeq 550 placements in China. Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X helped partially offset this impact, although we remain supply constrained in the first year of launch. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $119 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Before moving to regional results for Core Illumina, I'd like to highlight that we've implemented a new global commercial structure to improve operating efficiencies and better align with local markets. We've integrated APJ with emerging markets across Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and CIS. Going forward, we will report regional results for the following regions: Americas, Europe, Greater China and AMEA, or Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. Americas revenue of $605 million grew 5% sequentially from Q4 2022 and exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-anticipated NovaSeq X shipments. Revenue for the region was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected decline in Research, driven by the slowdown in COVID surveillance and delayed recruitment for some large research projects. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1k/2k in the Americas, with instrument shipments up over 20% year-over-year. Europe revenue of $261 million represented a 9% decrease year-over-year, or a 4% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in Clinical, led by oncology testing, was more than offset by the expected decline in COVID surveillance revenue as well as lower high-throughput instrument shipments due to supply constraints on NovaSeq X in the first quarter. Greater China revenue of $91 million represented a 28% decrease year-over-year, or a 23% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by persistent COVID disruptions and liquidity and funding constraints at our customers. This resulted in lower sequencing consumables revenue and a decrease in mid-throughput instrument shipments compared to last year. We will continue to closely monitor and mitigate market headwinds in China through the rest of the year. Finally, AMEA revenue of $119 million declined 27% year-over-year, or 23% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. As expected, the year-over-year decline was primarily caused by the completion of a large research project in Japan, lower COVID surveillance revenue and a decrease in NovaSeq 6000 instrument shipments, only partially offset by NovaSeq X shipments as demand in the region outpaced supply. AMEA revenue was also impacted by sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. We expect the impact of sanctions to persist through 2023 and have reflected approximately $60 million in lower sequencing consumables revenue expectations for the region in our outlook for 2023. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L: Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 65.2% decreased 500 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially through the year as we scale NovaSeq X manufacturing and continue to drive operating efficiencies. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $514 million were up $9 million year-over-year, primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected as a result of cost containment initiatives. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL: GRAIL revenue of $20 million for the quarter grew 100% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri. As expected, GRAIL revenue decreased sequentially due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022 related to MRD pharma partnerships. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $173 million and increased $34 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $10 million. First quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was negative $42 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we used $500 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2023 term notes that matured in March. Moving now to 2023 guidance. We still expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10%, including Core Illumina revenue growth of 6% to 9%. As a reminder, these ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates. GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. Our revenue outlook for 2023 now reflects the following offsetting factors: one, lower revenue in AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; two, an increase in our NovaSeq X shipment expectations to more than 330 instruments; and three, higher contributions from our strategic partnerships related to drug discovery. As we have previously stated, we expect quarterly Core Illumina revenue to ramp sequentially throughout 2023, with linearity trends similar to 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000, where we delivered approximately 54% of our total revenue in the second half of the year, including approximately 26% in Q3 and the remainder in Q4. Our revenue ramp for 2023 reflects the following assumptions: one, a quarterly ramp in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as the manufacturing capacity improves each quarter; two, sequencing consumables revenue increases as NovaSeq X customers kick off projects in the second half of 2023; and three, certain macroeconomic headwinds lessen in the second half of 2023, including a recovery from COVID disruptions in China. For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance: we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectations; we now expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue growth of approximately 5.5% year-over-year driven predominately by our lower revenue outlook for AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; we continue to expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year. This now includes a higher contribution from sequencing service and other revenue primarily due to higher contributions from strategic pharma partnerships. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50 for 2023, including a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%. We are reaffirming all other financial guidance for fiscal 2023 that we provided on February 7, 2023. Moving to the second quarter of 2023. We expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion for Q2 2023, reflecting a sequential increase of approximately 670 basis points from Q1 2023 at the midpoint or approximately $70 million, primarily driven by: a sequential increase in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as manufacturing capacity continues to ramp; continued sequential growth in sequencing consumables and service revenue as new instruments continue to come online; a sequential increase in GRAIL revenue driven by accelerating Galleri adoption; partially offset by a sequential decrease in microarrays revenue due to historical seasonality. For the second quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.01, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. These margins reflect a sequential increase in Core Illumina operating expenses driven by an increase in compensation-related expense due to our typical annual equity grant and merit adjustment in March. We continue to expect operating margins to improve in the second half of 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base. Looking forward, we are committing to achieve Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025. Illumina will reduce its annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. These cost savings will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. Illumina will achieve these savings through a combination of several actions. We will leverage the recent modularization of R&D innovation created as part of the NovaSeq X development, including XLEAP-SBS and new flow cell technology, to lower the cost and accelerate time to market for future platforms. We will achieve additional savings through leveraging our global footprint enabling activities at more cost-effective hubs. We are also streamlining our organization and processes, including rationalization of the company's global real estate portfolio and third-party vendor spend, as well as accelerating IT optimization efforts. The company will continue to prioritize innovations that generate highly differentiated products that are valued by Illumina's customers. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah, hi, Francis, Joydeep, thanks for taking the question. So, first one on the order book. It's good to see the increase there, but just wanted to get your expectations in terms of the overall funnel you're seeing? Could that 330 number continue to increase as you go through the year? And could you just help us understand your ability to ramp the production deliver through the year? What sort of cadence should we be assuming per quarter in terms of installs? And then, if I may ask on sort of a GRAIL question, more operational and execution questions. I mean, historically, product cycle at Illumina has taken preference above everything, but there are just a number of distractions in terms of legal front with European Commission, FDC and now you have an activist campaign as well. So, wondering if any of that risks the product cycle and the execution that you have here, or how separate are these efforts? Appreciate the responses on those. And then, if I could ask also about biotech funding. There have been questions around that from a peer today. Just wondering if you're seeing impact from any of the emerging biotechs and is that contemplated into your guide? Thanks for taking the questions.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Thanks, Puneet. You had a few questions there. So, let me work our way through it. So, first question was around the X and the order book of the X and the pipeline that we're seeing for the X. And your question was, well, 330, could it actually go up? And I think here the reality is that 330 is going to be more manufacturing bound than demand bound. I think it's the feeling we're getting right now that there's a huge amount of interest on -- in getting customers' hands on the X across our customer base. As you know, we always expected Research customers to be among the most aggressive early adopters and we thought Clinical would lag a little bit, but we're not seeing that this time. We're seeing strong demand from Clinical customers too as they are looking to launch new offerings on the X and expand into more sequencing intensive offerings. And you heard also that we're seeing strong demand from new-to- Illumina, new-to-high-throughput customers. And so, our expectation is that we'll continue to sort of build the demand and we'll be a little bit gated by how many Xs we can ship out the door over the course of this year. We were very encouraged by the scaling up of our manufacturing and operations teams in Q1. And as you saw, we were able to ship 67 instruments, so comfortably ahead of the guide we had of 40 to 50 instruments in Q1. So, manufacturing and scaling nicely. The teams are doing a terrific job. We are scaling that up to 80 in Q2, and so a nice little step up from Q1. And we'll take sort of gradual steps over the course of the year to get us to that 330. And so, to the extent that we're able to scale manufacturing better than that, we'll certainly update, keep you guys updated. In terms of -- there's a lot going on as you said. Obviously, all eyes are on the X for us, the story of this year is the X and this is what -- this is Illumina doing what we love to do, what we do best, launching a high-throughput instrument. And so while it seems like there's a lot going on terms of the regulatory process and so on, the reality is it's a very small part of the company that's actually involved in that. And the vast, vast, vast majority of our time and attention at Illumina is spent on getting our products out and really most of the focus is on the X right now. Oh, the other question \u2013 sorry, you had a question, one last piece. Salli just reminded you have a question about biotech funding. From our perspective, our direct exposure to small and mid-cap biotech funding companies is very small. And so, we don't expect that to have any kind of material impact on our revenue over the course of this year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions guys. Congrats on the strong start to the year. Maybe on the X, could you give a little color on this idea of the [replacement ratio] (ph) just early on from the order book thus far, how is that shaping up in terms of existing NovaSeq customers in terms of ordering the X? Kind of related to that, another question we get frequently is the X dramatically expands capacity. So, just wondering early on, obviously, we're going to see what the volume looks like as we get through this year, next year. But kind of how are you viewing kind of customers as they look to buy the X and fill it? Are they having any -- is that a gating factor? It doesn't appear to be. And then, the final one just on GRAIL, Francis. How should we think -- you've got three different regulatory decisions pending and you're in the middle of those with the EU directive coming likely soon. What's the most likely outcome in your mind for GRAIL that investors should be anticipating? And kind of when will we get clarity on that? Thank you.\nFrancis deSouza: Great. Thank you, Dan, for the questions. So, let's start with the X. Yes, very strong start to the year. We're really excited about that. And we spent a lot of time modeling what to expect in terms of the number of Xs that could be absorbed by the market over the next few years. And there are a number of ways to think about it, right? One is to take the static view today and say, okay, if we just have a conversion from an upgrade cycle from the 6000 to the X, what could that mean? Now you have to add to that the number of customers that are coming into the X as new-to-Illumina and new-to-high-throughput. But let me start with that, and just again assuming -- and I'll come to elasticity in a moment. But let's put elasticity aside for a moment. And so, you may remember we went through this discussion also with the 6000 to say, well, how should you think about the upgrade cycle and how many units it would take to satisfy the upgrade cycle? And there're a couple of ways you could do it. You could start with capacity back and think about what the ratio is for each X, how many 6000 that you're replacing. But really, we think the better way to think about it is to go customer out. And what I mean by that is we have roughly maybe 1,000 customers that are high-throughput customers of ours. About 750 of them have only one 6000. And so, for those 750, you can't buy less than a single X. And so, you can think about those 750 needing to purchase an X. And so, again, even if their demand for sequencing doesn't expand beyond today, which of course it will and we'll tap into elasticity, you can see that they'll require 750 right off the bat to serve that customer base. And then the 250 that have multiple 6000s will apply their own sort of conversion ratio. And then, of course, the elasticity we're tapping into, right? And as we shared on the call, the majority of the customers that are purchasing the X are purchasing the X because they want to tap into the elasticity associated with the lower price per sequencing. And so, the clinical customers are talking about new applications that they want to get into that are fundamentally enabled by the lower price for sequencing. It's the solid tumor oncology testing customer that's now looking to get into a liquid biopsy and knowing that they can access -- it takes 12 to 15 times more sequencing, but they can access the price point of the X to enable to do that under the reimbursement limits they have. It's the customers that are looking to do the larger research experiments around single cell or spatial. And so, that will be on top of the base case of the numbers I just talked about with people just straight up upgrading. In terms of the GRAIL regulatory process, so the way we're thinking about it is that the whole process comes to a head towards the end of this year, at the beginning of next year, because we expect to get decisions around the two most important appeals in that timeframe. In Europe, we expect to get a decision around the jurisdiction appeal in that timeframe. And in the US, you might have seen that in the last week, we got granted expedited review by the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for our appeal against the FTC. And so, that gives us even more confidence the decision will come even maybe a little earlier than had been initially anticipated, but certainly in the timeframe of later this year, early next year. And so, our expectation is that the whole sort of legal process winds up in that timeframe. Overall, at the same time, we got a divestiture work stream that we started a while ago, that work stream is all set to continue marching down the divestiture path. We're waiting for the divestiture order from the European Commission, which we expect to come out shortly. And so that path will be run-in parallel in the same timeframe as the appeals are happening.\nJoydeep Goswami: Francis, I'll just add to your elasticity comment on clinical, right, so it's -- you're absolutely right, these are new applications. Typically, these are fairly complex signatures that require high levels of sequencing. And Illumina, because it's a supplier of tools and reagents, starts making money as those clinical trials kick off even before the tests are available in the public market, right? So, our elasticity actually begins even before the test reaches the market.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the questions. Francis, Joydeep, can I just follow up on the comments there on elasticity? I mean, is that something you expect to materialize meaningfully in the back half of the year just in the sense that it can contribute to consumables growth for the year? I know in January, when you gave the outlook, one of the explicit drivers of the 8% consumables growth was elasticity. So, just trying to understand where things sit when it comes time to think about installation timing and ramping on usage that allows you to actually see that in the second half of the year and that you can count on it contributing to the overall target for the year?\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes, Dan, that's exactly right. As we had stated, right, we expect the installations and the initial work that customers to bring up their workflow to happen as we get into Q2 and Q3. And in Q4, we started to see some of these projects ramp up and customers to build inventory and start earnestly moving to the Xs their [world-class] (ph) platform.\nOperator: And moving on to our next -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.\nJoydeep Goswami: No, that's good. I think the question was about the X, hopefully, that answers that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple on the guidance here. Joydeep, what -- I guess, can you quantify this Russia headwind, which is incremental? And then, related to guidance, gross margins were down sequentially. We're looking at sub-65%. Can you talk about what changed sequentially from the Q4 number of 66%-and-change, it's down a couple of hundred basis points. And when you look at the operating margin guidance for 2Q, with first half being at 17%, I think the back half, you need to hit 26%, 27% for Core Illumina to hit the annual guide. What drives that 17% step-up to like 27% in the back half? Thank you.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So, Vijay, thanks for the question, and good calculations, rapid calculation of the math. So, let me first hit the simple question on the Russia headwind. So, as we said in the call, it's about $60 million for the full year and approximately $18 million in headwind year-over-year in Q2. You're right, gross margins were down sequentially for us in Q1. Actually, we had signaled some of this as we gave our guide in February. There are two specific reasons. So one, of course, is the launch of the Xs. We told you, the X is just ramping up, so margins for the X tend to be low. And of course, we sold more Xs than we anticipated in Q1. The other reason, as you go from Q1 to Q -- sorry, from Q4 to Q1, you typically have lower absorption in our factories, right? So that tends to lead to a sequential decline in gross margin as you move from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. In terms of operating margin for Q2, there are a couple of factors there, right? So, we -- as I mentioned in the call, there's -- we had our typical salary and promotional adjustments and equity adjustments. So, from -- as you move from Q1 to Q2, there is a one-time jump in overall operating expense. But of course, that then stabilizes for the rest of the year. The second factor, of course, in Q2 in terms of margins is we have -- because of the Russia issue, we have a shift again in a higher amount of instruments being sold, which has an impact on gross margin. So, those two combined offset some of the operating leverage that we are getting to keep margins at 17%. Now, you're absolutely right. We had indicated in our call that we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year. The two biggest reasons for that are really as we scale up and start to improve margins on the X, and of course, then consumables ramp up. So, we have a sequential step-up in each quarter. And because of that, absorption in our factories improves, leading to increased gross margin. And we do expect to exit the year with gross margins in the high 60%-s and operating margins close to the high 20% numbers that you indicated.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys, good evening, and thanks for the time here. So, Francis and Joydeep, maybe a couple on the Core and then a couple on GRAIL. So, on the Core business here, nice upside on the X shipments obviously versus what you indicated earlier in the year. But instrument revenues were essentially in line with our forecast. So, Joydeep, just the math there, was the offset essentially the EMEA weakness with the NextSeq 550 shipments in China? Or was there some sort of like greater-than-expected discounting or some such elsewhere in the portfolio? Second, for you, Francis, on the NextSeq, any updated thoughts on where you need to land on the per GB price point once you bring XLEAP to that platform next year? The competition is roughly at $2.00 a gig. So, do you think $4.00 to $5.00 is sort of a fair assumption? Or could it even be higher than that given the inertia to switching here? And then, on GRAIL really, the question that we get a lot is how committed are you to divesting the asset? Should you win that jurisdictional appeal and claw back the European Commission fine? So, put another way, I mean, what color could you share on the scenarios under which you could decide to keep GRAIL instead? I mean, is it essentially premised on what you'd get for the asset via an IPO or a sale or some such? Or just walk us through that thought process. Thank you.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. So, let me answer the instrument question first. So, yes, we were happy with our increased supply of NovaSeq X. And as we mentioned on the call, the primary offset was in terms of instruments, the offset in the mid-throughput instrument cycle. And that was again mostly due to the reduced 550 shipments, and that was primarily in China. In terms of pricing, I want to be very clear, we track pricing pretty carefully. We're not seeing any differential with the expected prices nor a decrease in the prices that we track, both for instruments and our consumables. So, they are exactly at where we had expected them to be. And I think the next question was, was it out to GRAIL or...\nFrancis deSouza: The next question was about -- maybe I'll jump in, to talk about NextSeq and the -- what the impact of XLEAP-SBS could be on NextSeq? And so, Tejas, as you know, when we put XLEAP-SBS on NextSeq, you'll see a number of pretty dramatic improvements. One, you'll see an improvement in the price points associated with NextSeq, and I'll come back to that because that's where your question was. But you'll also see improvements in other capabilities, right? So the actual performance of the chemistry in terms of quality and so on. And then, you'll obviously see the sustainability benefits, and that's a big draw for our customers, because with XLEAP-SBS chemistry, you don't need a cold chain when you are shipping the consumables. And that's a really big savings for our customers in terms of the sustainability value proposition of the product. Now in terms of how we think about the price, our perspective is -- and we're not enhancing the price right now, but our perspective is we want to price it such that we can maximize the market opportunity. And so clearly, we're going to bring prices down. But our products also have, uniquely in the market, additional capabilities, not only the sustainability features that I just talked about, but we have the onboard compute associated with having the FPGAs built into the NextSeq. We also have the onboard storage optimization, which is also unique to Illumina's NextSeq compared to any other mid-throughput instrument in the market. And so, we're going to bring the prices down, but we're also going to recognize the additional value we provide in our instruments. And that will be part of the calculus that determines what the ultimate pricing is, and it will be around what opens up the market the most in the mid-throughput segment. In terms of GRAIL, so the pass-through divestiture is -- to answer your question around what's about the divestiture and then in what scenario do you keep GRAIL. So, the pass-through divestiture is, obviously, the divestiture order will come out shortly, that will lay out the process and the structure of the divestiture. We have a divestiture team, that's already engaged with the team in the European Commission, and we'll move forward with that process. In parallel, we have the two appeals going. If we lose either of the appeals, we'll divest promptly in the best interest of our shareholders. And we expect that to play out again in the late this year, early next year kind of timeframe in parallel with the appeals that are happening. Under what scenario would we keep it? If we win both the appeals and, at that time, we have a chance to sort of look at the asset and sort of make sure that the assumptions in the business case that we did hold in terms of us keeping it compared towards divesting it. And so that would be the scenario under which we would keep the asset and integrate.\nOperator: And shortly, I'll be turning the call back over to Francis for closing remarks. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Julia Qin with J.P. Morgan.\nJulia Qin: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First off, regarding your operating margin targets, can you help us think about the upside/downside scenario? And in those numbers, do you assume that your in-house NovaSeq X manufacturing reaches full efficiency by the end of '24 or by the end of '25? And for the R&D efficiency, I wondering if you could elaborate on how to think about the magnitude of improvement in new product [indiscernible] before and after you implement that new R&D structure? And then, lastly, I wonder if you can comment more on China. Are you seeing any offset from the government stimulus? And are you seeing any signs of [indiscernible] recovery here? Thank you.\nJoydeep Goswami: Okay. So, let me -- Julia, let me take the operating margin target question. So, I think there are probably two steps there. For 2022, I want to reaffirm that we are still at our operating margin guidance of 22% for the year for Core. We see a couple of offsets there. So, of course, we are seeing more instruments in the number for the year, again, due to some of the offset from Russia about $60 million for the year. So for that, we do expect a slight gross margin hit, which will be offset by further productivity efforts on our manufacturing, and of course, some of the impact from the further cost reductions that we have introduced. In terms of your instrument or X manufacturing efficiencies, we do expect that by the end of the year, we will have achieved the efficiencies that we had initially outlined. We don't think the efficiencies will stop there. As we have done with all of our instruments, we continue to have further efficiencies as we go into subsequent years. So, you will see that those efficiencies continue to progress as we get into year two, three of manufacture. In terms of the R&D efficiencies that we talked about, so this is really coming from a couple of areas, and it's R&D and beyond, right? So, from the R&D side, we have spent a lot of effort in modularizing our innovations as part of the X and of course, even part of the NextSeq 1k/2k. And innovations like the new flow cell technology and XLEAP-SBS really allow us to radically reduce the spend per platform and for subsequent platforms and accelerate their time to market. So, you won't see this in 2023, but you'll see this in '24 and beyond. And then, we're also streamlining where we are doing some of our R&D, so leveraging our global footprint in more cost-effective hubs. So, this is for R&D, but also for other functions. And then that -- those kinds of activities also lead to further streamlining our organization and our processes allow us to rationalize our global real estate portfolio, spend and our IT infrastructure as well. So, again, you'll see that coming through starting towards the end of this year, but really kicking into place as we go into 2024 and beyond. And finally, in China, we are not seeing the benefits of any stimulus in China, at least for our business. We are monitoring China closely in terms of looking at some of the funding challenges our customers are facing and taking steps to mitigate some of these challenges.\nOperator: And we have a question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the big NovaSeq X placement. So, I want to stick on those 67 placements. Have any of those customers started decommissioning any of their 6000s? Traditionally, you had customers kind of can finish their old projects before starting on the X. Now you have really good consistency between platforms. Has any of that behavior might have changed? Have you seen any maybe subsequent orders on 6000 even though they've already switched to X? Just trying to really get a sense on kind of this dynamic. Thank you very much.\nJoydeep Goswami: Yeah. So, Dave, on -- thanks for the question. I think on the NovaSeq Xs, right, so you're right, a majority of our customers, they are -- they will transition their projects over time, and they are not intending, especially on the clinical side, not intending to decommission their NovaSeq 6000s. For the initial set of customers that we are tracking into from Q1 into Q2, we expect just about 10 to 12 decommissions as those Xs come online. But again, decommissions and replacements will be a smaller fraction. And as we get into the year, we'll provide more updates in terms of how the 6000 inventory -- or, 6000, not inventory, but set of installed base continues to evolve.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.\nKyle Mikson: Great. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the launch of the X here. Just one question for me. Historically, the company's revenue growth has been kind of elevated in the year or two following one of the meaningful signature launches. '17, '18 those were strong with 6000. '19 was a setback, and '14, '15 were solid with the HiSeq X. But in '16, growth was single digit. So, is there anything about the NovaSeq X launch that would lead to a different outcome? Or could Illumina be stuck in this kind of perennial cycle and dependence on new products driving near-term growth? Because now you have kind of more headwinds than you had in the past. I think it would be helpful to understand. Thanks.\nFrancis deSouza: Yes. Thanks for that question, Kyle. I'll say -- maybe a couple of points I'll make. One, product cycles are important in our market from a couple of perspectives. One, obviously, there's an upgrade cycle that they catalyze and that's typically more quick in the research market. And so historically, it's been very important in terms of driving near-term revenue growth because our market was primarily a research market. But now as we pointed out last quarter, 50% of our consumables are coming from the clinical market. I'd say that's one of the drivers of growth, but a big driver of growth is just going to be the growth in the clinical use cases. And so, we talked about the fact that we're seeing in the clinical markets from our proactive runs that we monitor continued strong growth of our clinical customers just because we're seeing more uptake of tests like the genetic disease testing segment that's continuing to grow or more coverage associated with oncology therapy selection or increased NIPT coverage. And so, as you look forward, a significant driver of growth is going to come more from adoption of sequencing in the clinical market more so necessary than just a straight upgrade cycle.\nJoydeep Goswami: I think just one more thing to add, right? Kyle, you will see a little bit of what we traditionally see as customers cut over from one system to the other, right? There will be a little bit of a transition from consumables from one system to the other. So, I don't think that can totally be avoided. But Francis is right. You see that much more with research customers than clinical customers, right? So that will tend to mitigate.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Francis deSouza.\nFrancis deSouza: Thank you for joining us. As we close the call, today is DNA Day, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. This month is also Illumina's 25th anniversary. Over our history, our team has played an important role in the genomic revolution by delivering breakthrough innovations that dramatically reduce sequencing costs and broaden access to genomics, unlocking new frontiers in biology and healthcare. And yet today, with only 4 million genomes ever sequenced, representing only 0.07% of the population, we are still at the beginning of the genome era. That concludes our call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Joydeep Goswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Francis. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.09 billion, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was down 11% year-over-year, or down 9% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging. This was primarily driven by an expected year-over-year slowdown in COVID surveillance, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally. Non-GAAP net income was $13 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.3% for the quarter, which increased from 17.8% in Q1 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&D capitalization requirements in dollar terms was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in quarter one 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results: Core Illumina revenue of $1.08 billion was down 12% year-over-year, which included an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 400 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $11 million in total revenue in Q1 2023 compared to $60 million in Q1 2022, reflecting a $49 million headwind. On a constant currency basis, Core Illumina revenue was down 10%, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $692 million was up 1% sequentially, but down 12% year-over-year, which included an approximately 500 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. In addition to the slowdown in COVID surveillance, the year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to lower NovaSeq 6000 consumables pull-through due to the headwinds I mentioned earlier, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally. Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 6% from Q4 2022 and 3% year-over-year. Research & Applied grew 7% from Q4 2022 and declined 4% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from Q4 2022 and 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $154 million declined 27% year-over-year, including a 300 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. As expected, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments compared to a record Q1 2022, and a decrease in mid-throughput shipments due primarily to fewer NextSeq 550 placements in China. Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X helped partially offset this impact, although we remain supply constrained in the first year of launch. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $119 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Before moving to regional results for Core Illumina, I'd like to highlight that we've implemented a new global commercial structure to improve operating efficiencies and better align with local markets. We've integrated APJ with emerging markets across Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and CIS. Going forward, we will report regional results for the following regions: Americas, Europe, Greater China and AMEA, or Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. Americas revenue of $605 million grew 5% sequentially from Q4 2022 and exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-anticipated NovaSeq X shipments. Revenue for the region was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected decline in Research, driven by the slowdown in COVID surveillance and delayed recruitment for some large research projects. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1k/2k in the Americas, with instrument shipments up over 20% year-over-year. Europe revenue of $261 million represented a 9% decrease year-over-year, or a 4% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in Clinical, led by oncology testing, was more than offset by the expected decline in COVID surveillance revenue as well as lower high-throughput instrument shipments due to supply constraints on NovaSeq X in the first quarter. Greater China revenue of $91 million represented a 28% decrease year-over-year, or a 23% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by persistent COVID disruptions and liquidity and funding constraints at our customers. This resulted in lower sequencing consumables revenue and a decrease in mid-throughput instrument shipments compared to last year. We will continue to closely monitor and mitigate market headwinds in China through the rest of the year. Finally, AMEA revenue of $119 million declined 27% year-over-year, or 23% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. As expected, the year-over-year decline was primarily caused by the completion of a large research project in Japan, lower COVID surveillance revenue and a decrease in NovaSeq 6000 instrument shipments, only partially offset by NovaSeq X shipments as demand in the region outpaced supply. AMEA revenue was also impacted by sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. We expect the impact of sanctions to persist through 2023 and have reflected approximately $60 million in lower sequencing consumables revenue expectations for the region in our outlook for 2023. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L: Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 65.2% decreased 500 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially through the year as we scale NovaSeq X manufacturing and continue to drive operating efficiencies. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $514 million were up $9 million year-over-year, primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected as a result of cost containment initiatives. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL: GRAIL revenue of $20 million for the quarter grew 100% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri. As expected, GRAIL revenue decreased sequentially due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022 related to MRD pharma partnerships. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $173 million and increased $34 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $10 million. First quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was negative $42 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we used $500 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2023 term notes that matured in March. Moving now to 2023 guidance. We still expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10%, including Core Illumina revenue growth of 6% to 9%. As a reminder, these ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates. GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. Our revenue outlook for 2023 now reflects the following offsetting factors: one, lower revenue in AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; two, an increase in our NovaSeq X shipment expectations to more than 330 instruments; and three, higher contributions from our strategic partnerships related to drug discovery. As we have previously stated, we expect quarterly Core Illumina revenue to ramp sequentially throughout 2023, with linearity trends similar to 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000, where we delivered approximately 54% of our total revenue in the second half of the year, including approximately 26% in Q3 and the remainder in Q4. Our revenue ramp for 2023 reflects the following assumptions: one, a quarterly ramp in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as the manufacturing capacity improves each quarter; two, sequencing consumables revenue increases as NovaSeq X customers kick off projects in the second half of 2023; and three, certain macroeconomic headwinds lessen in the second half of 2023, including a recovery from COVID disruptions in China. For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance: we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectations; we now expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue growth of approximately 5.5% year-over-year driven predominately by our lower revenue outlook for AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; we continue to expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year. This now includes a higher contribution from sequencing service and other revenue primarily due to higher contributions from strategic pharma partnerships. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50 for 2023, including a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%. We are reaffirming all other financial guidance for fiscal 2023 that we provided on February 7, 2023. Moving to the second quarter of 2023. We expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion for Q2 2023, reflecting a sequential increase of approximately 670 basis points from Q1 2023 at the midpoint or approximately $70 million, primarily driven by: a sequential increase in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as manufacturing capacity continues to ramp; continued sequential growth in sequencing consumables and service revenue as new instruments continue to come online; a sequential increase in GRAIL revenue driven by accelerating Galleri adoption; partially offset by a sequential decrease in microarrays revenue due to historical seasonality. For the second quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.01, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. These margins reflect a sequential increase in Core Illumina operating expenses driven by an increase in compensation-related expense due to our typical annual equity grant and merit adjustment in March. We continue to expect operating margins to improve in the second half of 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base. Looking forward, we are committing to achieve Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025. Illumina will reduce its annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. These cost savings will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. Illumina will achieve these savings through a combination of several actions. We will leverage the recent modularization of R&D innovation created as part of the NovaSeq X development, including XLEAP-SBS and new flow cell technology, to lower the cost and accelerate time to market for future platforms. We will achieve additional savings through leveraging our global footprint enabling activities at more cost-effective hubs. We are also streamlining our organization and processes, including rationalization of the company's global real estate portfolio and third-party vendor spend, as well as accelerating IT optimization efforts. The company will continue to prioritize innovations that generate highly differentiated products that are valued by Illumina's customers. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you. Francis, I'll just add to your elasticity comment on clinical, right, so it's -- you're absolutely right, these are new applications. Typically, these are fairly complex signatures that require high levels of sequencing. And Illumina, because it's a supplier of tools and reagents, starts making money as those clinical trials kick off even before the tests are available in the public market, right? So, our elasticity actually begins even before the test reaches the market. Yes, Dan, that's exactly right. As we had stated, right, we expect the installations and the initial work that customers to bring up their workflow to happen as we get into Q2 and Q3. And in Q4, we started to see some of these projects ramp up and customers to build inventory and start earnestly moving to the Xs their [world-class] (ph) platform. No, that's good. I think the question was about the X, hopefully, that answers that. Yes. So, Vijay, thanks for the question, and good calculations, rapid calculation of the math. So, let me first hit the simple question on the Russia headwind. So, as we said in the call, it's about $60 million for the full year and approximately $18 million in headwind year-over-year in Q2. You're right, gross margins were down sequentially for us in Q1. Actually, we had signaled some of this as we gave our guide in February. There are two specific reasons. So one, of course, is the launch of the Xs. We told you, the X is just ramping up, so margins for the X tend to be low. And of course, we sold more Xs than we anticipated in Q1. The other reason, as you go from Q1 to Q -- sorry, from Q4 to Q1, you typically have lower absorption in our factories, right? So that tends to lead to a sequential decline in gross margin as you move from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. In terms of operating margin for Q2, there are a couple of factors there, right? So, we -- as I mentioned in the call, there's -- we had our typical salary and promotional adjustments and equity adjustments. So, from -- as you move from Q1 to Q2, there is a one-time jump in overall operating expense. But of course, that then stabilizes for the rest of the year. The second factor, of course, in Q2 in terms of margins is we have -- because of the Russia issue, we have a shift again in a higher amount of instruments being sold, which has an impact on gross margin. So, those two combined offset some of the operating leverage that we are getting to keep margins at 17%. Now, you're absolutely right. We had indicated in our call that we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year. The two biggest reasons for that are really as we scale up and start to improve margins on the X, and of course, then consumables ramp up. So, we have a sequential step-up in each quarter. And because of that, absorption in our factories improves, leading to increased gross margin. And we do expect to exit the year with gross margins in the high 60%-s and operating margins close to the high 20% numbers that you indicated. Yes. So, let me answer the instrument question first. So, yes, we were happy with our increased supply of NovaSeq X. And as we mentioned on the call, the primary offset was in terms of instruments, the offset in the mid-throughput instrument cycle. And that was again mostly due to the reduced 550 shipments, and that was primarily in China. In terms of pricing, I want to be very clear, we track pricing pretty carefully. We're not seeing any differential with the expected prices nor a decrease in the prices that we track, both for instruments and our consumables. So, they are exactly at where we had expected them to be. And I think the next question was, was it out to GRAIL or... Okay. So, let me -- Julia, let me take the operating margin target question. So, I think there are probably two steps there. For 2022, I want to reaffirm that we are still at our operating margin guidance of 22% for the year for Core. We see a couple of offsets there. So, of course, we are seeing more instruments in the number for the year, again, due to some of the offset from Russia about $60 million for the year. So for that, we do expect a slight gross margin hit, which will be offset by further productivity efforts on our manufacturing, and of course, some of the impact from the further cost reductions that we have introduced. In terms of your instrument or X manufacturing efficiencies, we do expect that by the end of the year, we will have achieved the efficiencies that we had initially outlined. We don't think the efficiencies will stop there. As we have done with all of our instruments, we continue to have further efficiencies as we go into subsequent years. So, you will see that those efficiencies continue to progress as we get into year two, three of manufacture. In terms of the R&D efficiencies that we talked about, so this is really coming from a couple of areas, and it's R&D and beyond, right? So, from the R&D side, we have spent a lot of effort in modularizing our innovations as part of the X and of course, even part of the NextSeq 1k/2k. And innovations like the new flow cell technology and XLEAP-SBS really allow us to radically reduce the spend per platform and for subsequent platforms and accelerate their time to market. So, you won't see this in 2023, but you'll see this in '24 and beyond. And then, we're also streamlining where we are doing some of our R&D, so leveraging our global footprint in more cost-effective hubs. So, this is for R&D, but also for other functions. And then that -- those kinds of activities also lead to further streamlining our organization and our processes allow us to rationalize our global real estate portfolio, spend and our IT infrastructure as well. So, again, you'll see that coming through starting towards the end of this year, but really kicking into place as we go into 2024 and beyond. And finally, in China, we are not seeing the benefits of any stimulus in China, at least for our business. We are monitoring China closely in terms of looking at some of the funding challenges our customers are facing and taking steps to mitigate some of these challenges. Yeah. So, Dave, on -- thanks for the question. I think on the NovaSeq Xs, right, so you're right, a majority of our customers, they are -- they will transition their projects over time, and they are not intending, especially on the clinical side, not intending to decommission their NovaSeq 6000s. For the initial set of customers that we are tracking into from Q1 into Q2, we expect just about 10 to 12 decommissions as those Xs come online. But again, decommissions and replacements will be a smaller fraction. And as we get into the year, we'll provide more updates in terms of how the 6000 inventory -- or, 6000, not inventory, but set of installed base continues to evolve. I think just one more thing to add, right? Kyle, you will see a little bit of what we traditionally see as customers cut over from one system to the other, right? There will be a little bit of a transition from consumables from one system to the other. So, I don't think that can totally be avoided. But Francis is right. You see that much more with research customers than clinical customers, right? So that will tend to mitigate."

            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.09 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 in Q1, both ahead of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year but down year-over-year, as expected. Joydeep will take you through more detail later in the call. Our focus for the rest of the year is to deliver sequential growth primarily by scaling the production and distribution of NovaSeq X, driving elasticity on the back of its increased capabilities, and improving margins. We will share more on each. We achieved key product milestones in Q1, including shipping the first NovaSeq X systems. We also launched Illumina Complete Long Read technology and Illumina Connected Insights, a cloud-based tertiary analysis tool that addresses a key barrier to adoption, and will enable more labs to perform comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced tumors. Turning to our performance across platforms, beginning with high-throughput. The NovaSeq X launch further strengthened Illumina's competitive position in high-throughput sequencing. The strong global interest for the NovaSeq X series continued in Q1 and we exited the quarter with over 200 orders received from more than 30 countries. Clinical demand continued to be stronger than expected, generating approximately 40% of orders, with some customers planning to leverage the NovaSeq X to launch new clinical offerings. About 15% of orders are from new-to-high throughput customers, like the clinical genomics lab that is leveraging NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits to perform high-throughput whole genome, single cell, and RNA sequencing. Our manufacturing capabilities for NovaSeq X instruments and consumables are scaling nicely. We shipped 67 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1, above initial expectations of 40 to 50, and now expect to deliver more than 330 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from 300. Customers' initial runs are showing robust data output and sequencing quality, with some customers reporting outputs greater than 7 terabases and more than 95% of bases above Q30, well ahead of published specifications. As customers take delivery of their NovaSeq Xs and plan their deployments, they are sharing examples about how NovaSeq X will unlock demand elasticity in the sequencing market. Customers are planning to leverage the X's greater output and lower price per sample to sequence more samples, perform more analyses per sample, and obtain more data per analysis. For example, a leading European life science research institute will use NovaSeq X to scale up its data-intensive research programs, specifically in multi-omics, spatial, and single cell, enabling them to deliver \"atlas-scale\" projects. Within our clinical base, customers are using the greater output and cost savings of NovaSeq X to launch new, sequencing-intensive offerings. Some customers are planning to move from targeted panels to exomes and genomes, to achieve higher diagnostic yield and healthcare efficiency. An oncology customer is planning to use the X to launch liquid biopsy testing, which requires 12 to 15 times more sequencing than solid tumor testing. Some customers are using the cost and turnaround time benefits to enter deeper sequencing applications like minimal residual disease, or MRD, to build datasets at scale. We also saw continued demand for NovaSeq 6000, primarily for fleet expansions of existing workflows, and we shipped 17 NovaSeq 6000s in Q1. More than 80% of NovaSeq 6000 shipments were to clinical customers, and approximately 25% of shipments to oncology testing. In mid-throughput, NextSeq 1k/2k unit shipments increased 6% year-over-year, as customers expand their existing fleets, or continue to shift projects from the MiSeq and NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q1 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers. Our win rate in the mid-throughput segment remains strong, but we are seeing some sales cycles lengthen. Our low-throughput platforms continue to provide an entry point to sequencing. Approximately 30% of these shipments in the first quarter were to new-to-Illumina customers, further increasing our installed base and enabling adoption of sequencing across a broad customer network. Looking now at our clinical markets. Q1 marked an important milestone for Illumina, with clinical sequencing consumables revenue representing 50% of our total sequencing consumables revenue for the first time. In Q1, oncology testing consumables declined 3% year-over-year, but increased 21% sequentially, driven by growing clinical testing volumes and increased product development in areas like liquid biopsy and MRD. Some customers in this segment are facing pressures to improve profitability, which may in turn slow down their ability to develop new tests and scale. Revenue from our market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, was greater than $25 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year across more than 540 accounts, driven by increased utilization and pull-through, particularly in Europe. In March, we announced the expansion of our partnership with Myriad Genetics to broaden access to homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, testing. HRD is an important biomarker identifying tumors with a specific type of DNA damage, like those in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Our TSO 500 HRD, a research-use-only test, is now available in the US, with early customers like Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, one of the largest independent medical oncology and hematological practices in the United States. The expanded partnership also establishes a unique alliance to develop HRD as a companion diagnostic for novel agents targeting these tumors. There was significant progress for NGS-based oncology testing reimbursement this quarter in Europe, expanding the accessible market. Seven regions in Italy committed \u20ac10 million for next-generation sequencing in lung cancer. In Germany, health insurers commenced reimbursement for whole genome sequencing in pediatric cancer patients with relapse. And in the Czech Republic, funding for comprehensive genomic profiling was added to the national fee schedule, effective January 1st. Also in oncology, GRAIL saw accelerating demand in Q1 for its Galleri multi-cancer early detection blood test and delivered revenue of $20 million, exceeding plan, and representing 100% growth year-over-year. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $173 million, driven primarily by investments in clinical trials and scaling GRAIL's commercial organization. Since launch, GRAIL has received more than 85,000 Galleri test orders, with about 20,000 delivered in Q1 alone. The 140,000-participant NHS-Galleri trial, which completed enrollment in July 2022 in just over ten months, is progressing well, with more than half of study participants having returned for their second annual blood draw. The trial recently achieved its halfway point and is currently on track to meet retention targets. GRAIL continued to expand its partner relationships. Following a successful pilot last year, John Hancock, one of the largest life insurance companies in the US and a unit of Manulife, announced that it would expand access to Galleri to eligible life insurance customers. And Providence, a health system serving the Western US, expanded its partnership with GRAIL to offer Galleri to eligible individuals across its 52 hospitals and 900 clinics across seven states. In reproductive health, consumables shipments declined 4% year-over-year, primarily due to FX, but increased 14% sequentially due to continued coverage progress. In the US, Virginia and Michigan initiated state Medicaid coverage for NIPT in all pregnancies, adding about 4.3 million additional covered lives and more than 70,000 pregnancies per year. Genetic Disease Testing, or GDT, had a record quarter. In Q1, GDT consumables shipments grew 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Coverage continues to grow for whole genome sequencing in patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases. During the quarter, one of the largest US health insurance companies updated their policy to include Managed Medicaid lives in 16 states, adding another approximately 3.8 million covered lives for whole genome sequencing. Also in GDT, earlier this month we announced a partnership with Henry Ford Health, a health care organization in the Detroit metro area and a leading US academic medical center, to assess how whole-genome sequencing can improve cardiovascular disease management, with a particular interest in diverse and underserved populations. Turning to our Research and Applied markets, sequencing consumables shipments were down 19% year-over-year, primarily due to the slowdown in COVID surveillance. Looking at the whole year, we are on track to deliver on our financial commitments for 2023 as well as some important releases in the coming quarters. Specifically, we will ship the ICLR enrichment assay, an affordable, high throughput, targeted long-read solution, in Q3 and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k in the first half of 2024, delivering step-change cost, speed, and sustainability benefits on that platform. Finally, as we navigate through this dynamic environment, we are focused on delivering durable success for our shareholders through a balance of investing in breakthrough innovations for future growth, while delivering operating leverage through disciplined expense management across the organization. To that end, we announced earlier today our commitment to deliver Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025, while maintaining investment in the key elements of our innovation roadmap. Building on the cost reduction actions announced last November, we are taking additional steps to reduce our annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. This will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, as well as provide more detail on the steps we are taking to deliver on the cost reduction I mentioned. Joydeep? Great. Thanks, Puneet. You had a few questions there. So, let me work our way through it. So, first question was around the X and the order book of the X and the pipeline that we're seeing for the X. And your question was, well, 330, could it actually go up? And I think here the reality is that 330 is going to be more manufacturing bound than demand bound. I think it's the feeling we're getting right now that there's a huge amount of interest on -- in getting customers' hands on the X across our customer base. As you know, we always expected Research customers to be among the most aggressive early adopters and we thought Clinical would lag a little bit, but we're not seeing that this time. We're seeing strong demand from Clinical customers too as they are looking to launch new offerings on the X and expand into more sequencing intensive offerings. And you heard also that we're seeing strong demand from new-to- Illumina, new-to-high-throughput customers. And so, our expectation is that we'll continue to sort of build the demand and we'll be a little bit gated by how many Xs we can ship out the door over the course of this year. We were very encouraged by the scaling up of our manufacturing and operations teams in Q1. And as you saw, we were able to ship 67 instruments, so comfortably ahead of the guide we had of 40 to 50 instruments in Q1. So, manufacturing and scaling nicely. The teams are doing a terrific job. We are scaling that up to 80 in Q2, and so a nice little step up from Q1. And we'll take sort of gradual steps over the course of the year to get us to that 330. And so, to the extent that we're able to scale manufacturing better than that, we'll certainly update, keep you guys updated. In terms of -- there's a lot going on as you said. Obviously, all eyes are on the X for us, the story of this year is the X and this is what -- this is Illumina doing what we love to do, what we do best, launching a high-throughput instrument. And so while it seems like there's a lot going on terms of the regulatory process and so on, the reality is it's a very small part of the company that's actually involved in that. And the vast, vast, vast majority of our time and attention at Illumina is spent on getting our products out and really most of the focus is on the X right now. Oh, the other question \u2013 sorry, you had a question, one last piece. Salli just reminded you have a question about biotech funding. From our perspective, our direct exposure to small and mid-cap biotech funding companies is very small. And so, we don't expect that to have any kind of material impact on our revenue over the course of this year. Great. Thank you, Dan, for the questions. So, let's start with the X. Yes, very strong start to the year. We're really excited about that. And we spent a lot of time modeling what to expect in terms of the number of Xs that could be absorbed by the market over the next few years. And there are a number of ways to think about it, right? One is to take the static view today and say, okay, if we just have a conversion from an upgrade cycle from the 6000 to the X, what could that mean? Now you have to add to that the number of customers that are coming into the X as new-to-Illumina and new-to-high-throughput. But let me start with that, and just again assuming -- and I'll come to elasticity in a moment. But let's put elasticity aside for a moment. And so, you may remember we went through this discussion also with the 6000 to say, well, how should you think about the upgrade cycle and how many units it would take to satisfy the upgrade cycle? And there're a couple of ways you could do it. You could start with capacity back and think about what the ratio is for each X, how many 6000 that you're replacing. But really, we think the better way to think about it is to go customer out. And what I mean by that is we have roughly maybe 1,000 customers that are high-throughput customers of ours. About 750 of them have only one 6000. And so, for those 750, you can't buy less than a single X. And so, you can think about those 750 needing to purchase an X. And so, again, even if their demand for sequencing doesn't expand beyond today, which of course it will and we'll tap into elasticity, you can see that they'll require 750 right off the bat to serve that customer base. And then the 250 that have multiple 6000s will apply their own sort of conversion ratio. And then, of course, the elasticity we're tapping into, right? And as we shared on the call, the majority of the customers that are purchasing the X are purchasing the X because they want to tap into the elasticity associated with the lower price per sequencing. And so, the clinical customers are talking about new applications that they want to get into that are fundamentally enabled by the lower price for sequencing. It's the solid tumor oncology testing customer that's now looking to get into a liquid biopsy and knowing that they can access -- it takes 12 to 15 times more sequencing, but they can access the price point of the X to enable to do that under the reimbursement limits they have. It's the customers that are looking to do the larger research experiments around single cell or spatial. And so, that will be on top of the base case of the numbers I just talked about with people just straight up upgrading. In terms of the GRAIL regulatory process, so the way we're thinking about it is that the whole process comes to a head towards the end of this year, at the beginning of next year, because we expect to get decisions around the two most important appeals in that timeframe. In Europe, we expect to get a decision around the jurisdiction appeal in that timeframe. And in the US, you might have seen that in the last week, we got granted expedited review by the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for our appeal against the FTC. And so, that gives us even more confidence the decision will come even maybe a little earlier than had been initially anticipated, but certainly in the timeframe of later this year, early next year. And so, our expectation is that the whole sort of legal process winds up in that timeframe. Overall, at the same time, we got a divestiture work stream that we started a while ago, that work stream is all set to continue marching down the divestiture path. We're waiting for the divestiture order from the European Commission, which we expect to come out shortly. And so that path will be run-in parallel in the same timeframe as the appeals are happening. The next question was about -- maybe I'll jump in, to talk about NextSeq and the -- what the impact of XLEAP-SBS could be on NextSeq? And so, Tejas, as you know, when we put XLEAP-SBS on NextSeq, you'll see a number of pretty dramatic improvements. One, you'll see an improvement in the price points associated with NextSeq, and I'll come back to that because that's where your question was. But you'll also see improvements in other capabilities, right? So the actual performance of the chemistry in terms of quality and so on. And then, you'll obviously see the sustainability benefits, and that's a big draw for our customers, because with XLEAP-SBS chemistry, you don't need a cold chain when you are shipping the consumables. And that's a really big savings for our customers in terms of the sustainability value proposition of the product. Now in terms of how we think about the price, our perspective is -- and we're not enhancing the price right now, but our perspective is we want to price it such that we can maximize the market opportunity. And so clearly, we're going to bring prices down. But our products also have, uniquely in the market, additional capabilities, not only the sustainability features that I just talked about, but we have the onboard compute associated with having the FPGAs built into the NextSeq. We also have the onboard storage optimization, which is also unique to Illumina's NextSeq compared to any other mid-throughput instrument in the market. And so, we're going to bring the prices down, but we're also going to recognize the additional value we provide in our instruments. And that will be part of the calculus that determines what the ultimate pricing is, and it will be around what opens up the market the most in the mid-throughput segment. In terms of GRAIL, so the pass-through divestiture is -- to answer your question around what's about the divestiture and then in what scenario do you keep GRAIL. So, the pass-through divestiture is, obviously, the divestiture order will come out shortly, that will lay out the process and the structure of the divestiture. We have a divestiture team, that's already engaged with the team in the European Commission, and we'll move forward with that process. In parallel, we have the two appeals going. If we lose either of the appeals, we'll divest promptly in the best interest of our shareholders. And we expect that to play out again in the late this year, early next year kind of timeframe in parallel with the appeals that are happening. Under what scenario would we keep it? If we win both the appeals and, at that time, we have a chance to sort of look at the asset and sort of make sure that the assumptions in the business case that we did hold in terms of us keeping it compared towards divesting it. And so that would be the scenario under which we would keep the asset and integrate. Yes. Thanks for that question, Kyle. I'll say -- maybe a couple of points I'll make. One, product cycles are important in our market from a couple of perspectives. One, obviously, there's an upgrade cycle that they catalyze and that's typically more quick in the research market. And so historically, it's been very important in terms of driving near-term revenue growth because our market was primarily a research market. But now as we pointed out last quarter, 50% of our consumables are coming from the clinical market. I'd say that's one of the drivers of growth, but a big driver of growth is just going to be the growth in the clinical use cases. And so, we talked about the fact that we're seeing in the clinical markets from our proactive runs that we monitor continued strong growth of our clinical customers just because we're seeing more uptake of tests like the genetic disease testing segment that's continuing to grow or more coverage associated with oncology therapy selection or increased NIPT coverage. And so, as you look forward, a significant driver of growth is going to come more from adoption of sequencing in the clinical market more so necessary than just a straight upgrade cycle. Thank you for joining us. As we close the call, today is DNA Day, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. This month is also Illumina's 25th anniversary. Over our history, our team has played an important role in the genomic revolution by delivering breakthrough innovations that dramatically reduce sequencing costs and broaden access to genomics, unlocking new frontiers in biology and healthcare. And yet today, with only 4 million genomes ever sequenced, representing only 0.07% of the population, we are still at the beginning of the genome era. That concludes our call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events."

Illumina delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. We are making significant progress in expanding margins and driving earnings, growing the utilization of the NovaSeq X platform, and bringing the next phase of sequencing innovation to our customers. In Q3, revenue was $1.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Across our regions, America's revenue was down 6% year-over-year, Europe revenue was up 12%, EMEA revenue was up 7%, and Greater China was down 23%. In the quarter, we placed an additional 58 NovaSeq X Plus instruments, bringing our total installed base to 527. Approximately 40% of this installed base has been shipped to clinical customers, highlighting the diversity of our user base. The X-Series surpassed $1 billion in cumulative revenue, a major milestone. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 22.6% and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, exceeding our expectations, and we began executing on the capital allocation strategy we laid out at our August Strategy Update. Looking ahead through year-end, while the funds remain healthy, the near-term macroeconomic environment has been persistently constrained. We now expect our 2024 revenue growth to be slightly lower than our prior guidance range. However, we are raising our guidance for both 2024 operating margin and earnings per share, reflecting the significant progress we have made so far this year in our transformative journey, driving operational excellence and strengthening our culture of performance. Ankur will provide additional details during his remarks. During our August Strategy Update, we laid out a plan to drive high single-digit revenue growth and 500 basis points of operating margin expansions by 2027, while achieving annual EPS growth in the double-digits to teens over the next three years. To achieve this, I've set key priorities to guide execution against our strategy, deeper customer collaboration, continuous innovation, and commitment to operational excellence and margin expansion. Our first priority, deeper customer collaboration, is centered on providing a range of targeted solutions to serve the increasingly diverse needs of our customer base. Over the past several months, I've continued connecting with our customers worldwide. Most recently, this included a group of academic core lab directors that have a long legacy of collaboration with Illumina and are some of our most experienced users. I'm grateful to them for their ongoing partnership and support. As we evolve the way we engage with customers, we have focused on two key initiatives. One, shifting how we interact and collaborate with customers to support their ambitions. My observation was that we needed to do better in this area. And now I'm beginning to hear from customers that they are seeing Illumina present itself in a new way. And two, giving customers a clear line of sight to the significant innovations we have in the pipeline. Their early input is invaluable, allowing us to develop the most impactful products and solutions in the industry. I'm pleased to see this partner mindset become increasingly embedded into our company's culture. It will serve as a cornerstone of our success going forward. Our second priority is continuous innovation, which follows naturally from our first priority as it is driven and shaped by what customers are telling us they need. For example, we recently announced the launch of the groundbreaking MiSeq i100. We are addressing demand for flexible solutions for smaller scale projects with faster turnaround time. Early feedback is validating our approach of bringing customers into the fold as advisors throughout the product development process. Customers are excited about room temperature shipping and storage arrangements, allowing for sequencing on demand without the need to store reagents. The shorter runtimes paired with 18 proven end-to-end workflows are what our customers have been asking for. And they have expressed that this is a game changer. Over time, we intend to leverage these new technologies in future releases across our portfolio. MiSeq i100 instruments for early access customers will begin shipping in late Q4, driven by the strong demand we saw in the days following the announcements. At our strategy update, we shared a number of additional innovation, including comprehensive whole genome sequencing and our five-phase genome that will launch over the next 12 to 18 months. Collectively, these technologies will reinvent genome while making NGS workflow easier. Comprehensive whole genome solution leverages a novel constellation map read technology to add additional layers of genomic data, redefining the extent of information created by the SPS chemistry. Standard library prep is eliminated as it is performed directly on the flow cell, going from multiple hours of hands-on time to just a few minutes. Another customer-driven innovation is the five-phase genome, which will provide variant and epigenetic information from a single library prep. Customers will have access to methylation information in every run, which is important to understand diseases, including cancer, obesity, and infectious diseases. Both the five-phase genome and constellation map read technology solutions are currently in development, with customers providing feedback that will influence our product advancements. We will be providing further details on these two innovations, including results from early access customers at upcoming industry events like ASHG later this week. In the near term, Illumina continues to deliver innovations for the NovaSeq X Series. We remain on track to begin shipping the single-flow cell NovaSeq X by the end of this year. This instrument will be upgradable to the NovaSeq X+. In Q4, we will introduce 100-cycle and 200-cycle 25B flow cells designed for high-output counting applications, such as single-cell and proteomics. Our third priority is operational excellence. Our focus here is to build a foundation that powers our long-term success, regardless of the top line. By enhancing productivity, optimizing our investment spend, and driving smart capital allocation, we are positioning Illumina to directly benefit not only our customers and the patients they serve, but also our employees and our shareholders. Indeed, we have made great progress in building a culture where every employee is driving efficiencies to contribute to operational excellence. Now I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our third quarter results and outlook.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thank you, Jacob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll give you an overview of our financial results, provide more color about revenue, expenses, earnings, and developments on our balance sheet, and then speak about our outlook going forward. All financial information, including guidance that we shared on this call, is for Core Illumina only and excludes GRAIL. During the third quarter, Illumina's revenue of $1.08 billion was in line with our expectations, and the team delivered a very strong margin and earnings expansion through ongoing cost discipline and operational excellence. Cash generation remains strong, and we also put cash to use across all dimensions of our capital allocation strategy. Now I will add color to each of these items. Third quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, with strong growth in our consumables business offset by the instruments business declining against launch year compares. Sequencing consumables revenue was $741 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued strong uptake in X consumables. The NovaSeq X transition progressed faster than we forecasted. As of end of Q3, more than 55% of high throughput gigabases sequenced and more than 35% of high throughput consumables revenue was on the NovaSeq X series. We saw some acceleration of the transition from 6K to X this quarter, including in clinical as approximately 40% of high throughput clinical gigabases sequenced were on the NovaSeq X series. As legacy assays transition to the X series, we have seen increased clinical volumes and increasing adoption of the 25B flow cell from clinical customers. While there will be some quarterly variations in the pace of transition based on choices our customers make, we still believe almost half of high throughput consumables revenue could transition to the X series by middle of 2025. Moving to sequencing activity, total sequencing GB output on our connected high and mid throughput instruments continue to grow at a rate more than 40% year-over-year, with robust growth from both clinical and research customers. Sequencing instruments revenue was $104 million for Q3, a 42% year-over-year decline, slightly behind our expectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by two factors. One, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant pre-order launch related shipments in the third quarter of 2023. And two, a decline in mid throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements globally. Sequencing service and other revenue was $150 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships as well as high instrument service contract revenue on a growing install base. Moving to the rest of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% for the quarter increased 450 basis points year-over-year. This strong gross margin performance was driven primarily by the execution of our operational excellence initiatives that continue to improve productivity and deliver cost savings. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was also supported by a more favorable revenue mix of sequencing consumables, making up roughly half of that improvement. While the business mix will change on quarter-to-quarter basis, the productivity improvements we have achieved are sustainable and will support our margin expansion going forward. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $517 million were roughly flat to last quarter. This includes the additional headcount and expenses resulting from our acquisition of Fluent BioSciences. The Illumina team continues to manage expenses effectively. As I mentioned during our strategy update, we have several actions in play to reprioritize and reduce our expenses. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.6% compared to the 22.5% in the prior year period. This came in well above our guidance of approximately 20%, driven by strong operational performance across gross margin and discipline and expenses. Below the operating income line, non-GAAP other expense was $14 million in Q3. During the quarter, we issued $500 million in debt at a 4.65% coupon that was used, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full the high-cost $750 million delayed broad term loan, effectively de-levering and also reducing our interest rate. Non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter. In Q3, we received the benefit of a few one-time credits as we filed our return for last year. Putting it all together, non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $181 million for diluted earnings per share for $1.14 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 160 million shares. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter, cash flow provided by operations was healthy at $316 million. Capital expenditures were $32 million, and free cash flow was $284 million. During the quarter, we put cash to work in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. We acquired Fluent BioSciences, adding innovative instrument-free single-cell technology to Illumina's portfolio. We're excited about the potential for very large single-cell experiments this technology can enable. In addition, following authorization from our board earlier this quarter, we put a share repurchase program in place and repurchased 770,000 shares of Illumina stock for $98 million at an average price of $127.71 per share. And as noted, we de-levered. Taken together, these capital actions show the strength of our operational execution in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $939 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. In summary, revenue was in line with expectations. The transition of high-throughput sequencing to the NovaSeq X is going quite well. We announced breakthrough new products in low throughput. We made significant progress towards our stated goal of margin expansion, and we have been deploying our strong cash flow towards revenue growth, improved earnings, and shareholder-friendly capital actions. Moving now to 2024 guidance. Although our overall Q3 revenue results met our expectations, we are tempering our revenue expectations for year-end business and now expect full-year revenue to be down approximately 3%. For Q4, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.07 billion. We continue to see strong utilization levels and pull through on our instruments, but the near-term macroeconomic environment remains constrained and does not support any uptick in purchasing behavior through the end of the year. From an instruments versus consumables perspective, the projected mix is unchanged, and we're still forecasting instrument revenue to decline in the mid-30s percentage range relative to 2023. Although we are very excited about MiSeq 100, it is in early access, and we will receive minimal revenue contribution in Q4. As we had planned for, our low-throughput instrument business will likely decline in Q4, with customers waiting for the new instrument. For high throughput, we still expect second-half NovaSeq X shipments to be above what we delivered in the first half of 2024. We also still forecast sequencing consumables revenue to grow towards the upper end of the low single-digit percentage range versus 2023. We saw strong uptake and GB usage in the third quarter, setting the stage for exiting the year with solid year-over-year consumables growth. While we're disappointed in our lower revenue guidance, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin and diluted EPS, reflecting both the outperformance in Q3 and carrying forward the impact of our operational excellence initiatives into Q4. We are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a range of 21% to 21.5% for 2024. We are reducing our projected tax rate for the year to approximately 24%. And lastly, we're raising our guidance range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $4.05 to $4.15 range for full year 2024. With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Ankur. As I reflect on my first year, I'm excited for the early progress Illumina has made and the momentum we have created to drive the industry forward. We refocused the company on our strong core business and launched our new strategy. We reset the leadership team and made the necessary structural changes to support our customer-first orientation. We have been increasingly embedding operational excellence in our culture, and the results are beginning to show in our financials. This is a good start to our multi-year transformation journey. For 2025, we are looking forward to returning to growth, although I would like to finish Q4 before providing specific guidance. Ultimately, I'm encouraged and feel confident in bringing Illumina back to high single-digit revenue growth by 2027, as stated during our strategy update. Thank you for joining today. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go on first to Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: On guidance, just specifically, keeping in mind you are guiding revenue down a slight bit sequentially, what do you expect to drop, and specifically, do you expect sequenced and consumable revenue to grow sequentially and kind of building off of this? From a clinical standpoint, you're making really good progress in terms of placements with clinical customers. When you place a box, how much visibility do you have on that customer's plan? Specifically, do you know when existing assays are going to be moved from a legacy instrument to the X? I'm just looking for some help addressing concerns about a clinical cliff for consumable revenue as we look ahead to '25. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, thanks for that. I've heard this clinical cliff a few times, and I don't think that's the way we look at the business right now. I think, first and foremost, we are, of course, excited to see that there continues to be strong momentum moving towards the X. As Ankur was mentioning earlier that we are seeing the strong momentum. We are seeing a lot of volume moving towards the X. So, everything is pointing into the direction that we were also presenting at the Strategy Day. As you also mentioned, we did take down, and we were tweaking the guidance here for coming out of Q3 into Q4. As we did not see, even though we see a very healthy instrument funnel, we're not seeing the normal end-of-year activity that we would normally see. But as you're also mentioning, we actually saw a very nice uptake in our revenue for the consumables. I think that's also what we mentioned before, is a strong indicator for that we are seeing the trajectory of moving towards the X. With the specifics on clinical and on how we have transparency to our customers, we do spend, actually, quite a lot of time, especially with our larger customers. As I mentioned before, we are spending a lot of time, actually, to work closely with them to understand where they're going to actually go deeper into where we are with our funnel and what we have in our R&D pipeline, so they can get prepared to transition when we come out with new technologies. That goes both for our academic customers, but certainly also our clinical customers. We also have a quite good understanding on what the different projects they're looking into and when they're transitioning over to the X. Now, I would say that if I just look at it from a high-level perspective, we don't see a lot of customers that are going from completely 6K and over to X in a few months. This is normally assay by assay, and it takes time. It usually takes a year, if not 18 months, to transition over to the X. But what Ankur was also saying, we've seen more than 40% of the volume now for the clinical accounts.\nAnkur Dhingra: This is Ankur. Doug, on the other part, specifically to your question about the guidance for Q4 consumables, our guide right now assumes a typical seasonal decline from Q3 to Q4 in consumables. As you know, there are lots of holidays during Q4 relative to the other quarters. I looked back and looked at the trends for the last few years as well. And seasonally, the consumables purchases do kind of follow that seasonal pattern down in Q4, and that's what I'm assuming in the guide right now. Nothing underlying from a transition perspective or a clinical transition, et cetera, perspective there, simple seasonality.\nOperator: We'll move next to Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: So, I just wanted to clarify on the mid-throughput side, was that decline in mid-throughput came mostly from China, or was the decline in the quarter U.S. and Europe seeing more competition from a U.S.-based mid-throughput competitor? And then just briefly asking about 2025, I understand it's hard for you to provide a number there, but just can you walk us through the considerations that you have there for 2025? One of the biggest is obviously the clinical transition here for the customers as they switch over, obviously they'll purchase new instruments, that's a revenue, but at the same time they will also be taking a lower cost, which will reduce revenue to you. So, just can you walk us through the considerations as you think about 2025? Thank you so much.\nJacob Thaysen: Okay. Thanks for that. And I think, Puneet, let me start with the first one, is that I think we continue to see a lot of competition across the world. I'm actually quite encouraged with China. As you might recall, we have a new leader coming in almost six months ago in China, and Jenny has done a fantastic job to reset the organization, reconfigure the organization, also reset our relationship with many of our partners, and including also looking at different type of pricing strategy. And I think we're starting to see that actually working now, meaning that we are starting to see that sequentially we are seeing flat revenue there, so at least we are starting to see a change in pattern in China. It's too early to call it up. Competition in the rest of the world, you're absolutely right that we are seeing most competition in the mid-throughput. I will say that we take that very seriously, I've said that before, but I actually think it's something that keeps us on the toes here, and it's something that I truly believe is important as a company to have competition. It makes us more agile, it makes us better in front of our customers, so I enjoy that. I will say that if you look into the performance of the mid-throughput itself, I had a conversation the other day, as I also mentioned, with the academic Core Lab directors, and during those conversations we were also looking to where they're getting their business from, and we see more and more of, they see a lot of customers, small biotech companies, all the small companies that previously would buy a likely mid-throughput instrument and do sequencing themselves, due to their financial constraints right now, many of them are outsourcing, and we still see, and thereby those lab directors will see more of that business. And for us, as we mentioned before, the macroeconomic is still the majority of the pressure we see in the mid-throughput. So if you look into 2025, I think we would still like to see end of this year before we go deeper into our considerations into 2025. But that said, as I mentioned, in the strategy day, we are expecting, we're still very committed to that we will end at high single-digit growth by 2027, as we also mentioned, we were stepping ourselves into that, and we expect to go from 2024, where we had negative growth here, and then step into positive growth regime in 2025.\nOperator: We'll move next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Jacob or Ankur, maybe both of you can chime in on a lot of details here. The activity levels were about 40%, but I didn't hear a price for GB commentary. Was that in line with the minus 20, minus 25 that you expected at the Analyst Day? And given the mixed impacts here on margins, sorry, I think at the end of the Analyst Day you said 500 basis points of margin expansion. Is that off of the updated margin base of 21 to 21.5, or should we readjust the expansion given the guide increase for fiscal '24?\nJacob Thaysen: Well, first, thanks for that, Vijay, and I'll have Ankur to talk a little bit about the specific in the guidance here, but I will say that I'm very encouraged to see us delivering on our GM growth margin, but also our operating margin and EPS. I think it speaks a volume to the Illumina team and the company we want to be, that in tough times, we're also able to deliver significant progress in our margin expansion. So I'm excited about that, and I think it should give certain very strong proof points that we are highly committed to deliver on the 500-basis point that we set out to do at the Strategy Day. But, Ankur, do you want to remind where we are?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, absolutely. So, Vijay, I think I answered the first question in between around that price thing. Yes, it was in that 25-percentage range. You've said that if the transition from 6K to X, since it accelerated, this quarter we did see the price impact towards the higher end of that range, closer towards 25 rather than 20, but it was still within that model range. Now, around the margins, I can tell you I'm very pleased with the results. As I think about the 500 basis points, and I'm thinking of 21% as the base to work off that 500 basis point expansion, it's premised on two things, right? Our ability to expand our gross margins and be in that high 60s to 70% range. And what the team has been able to do here is crank up that model and get us, start giving us a view of what the model could be as we keep driving it higher. We still have lots of opportunity to take cost out within COGS to structurally get closer to that 70%. For now, this quarter, higher mix was certainly beneficial. And then on the OPEC side, again, several levers still, but I think working off of that 21% and where we land this quarter and how we're looking at 2024 to end, I feel very good about the progress that we're making.\nOperator: We'll move next to Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Maybe first one, I'm sorry I joined late, but maybe could you break out, I know a little, you gave some color on data growth, I believe, but could you break out a little bit how we think about NGS consumable revenue growth from the perspective of the research customer base versus the clinical customer base in Q3 and kind of how did that progress versus expectations?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. I think I can, I don't know if you're breaking that out very clearly, but overall our consumables growth was up 6% for the quarter and then both research and clinical grew nicely. There wasn't a dramatic shift between the two.\nDan Brennan: Okay. Maybe stepping back just on kind of the outlook for kind of instruments that you discussed, could you give some color, what's now contemplated in the full year guide from a mid-throughput basis? I don't think you guys gave any kind of breakdown in the quarter what the mid-throughput placements were, but I know they were light. So any kind of math or any color you can provide for us about the mid-throughput number and kind of what's assumed now for the full year?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So at this point, we're not providing actual placement for mid-throughput. We will give you an update for the full year at the JPMorgan as we usually do. And I think, Ankur, maybe you're a little, you want to go back on margins?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. The sequence. Yes. Yes. I misspoke. The consumables growth for the quarter is 7%, not 6%. And yes, the research and clinical are both growing nicely.\nDan Brennan: Maybe can I sneak one other one in just on the X? I mean, is it fair to think, while you're not commenting on 25 at this point, I know we're in a difficult CapEx environment, but is it fair to contemplate like X placements in 25? Is it likely to start down year-over-year versus 24 or is it too early to say just given kind of the environment we're in?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. We would like, as I mentioned, we would like to do the guide when we are, when we're ready to do that by the beginning of the year.\nOperator: We'll move next to Tycho Peterson with Jefferies.\nTycho Peterson: Just thinking a little bit about the clinical X transition seems to be happening. Maybe some momentum picking up here. How are you thinking about the pricing headwind of that as we think about going forward? Obviously cost per gig is lower and then you have the dynamic of, you know, some of those oncology customers locked into multi-year contracts, around GRAIL that they were able to sign. Do those break, I guess, with the transition to X? How do we think about those dynamics?\nJacob Thaysen: So overall, we are, of course, pleased with that we continue to see our customers move towards X. We believe that the X platform is providing substantial benefit from our customers, both from a lower price point, but also the workflows that is able, combined with the Dragon compute power that we have and the interpretation power that we have. So there's a lot of reasons why our customers want to move on to the X. But as you also know, in the clinical space, you need to do a lot of work up front, validation and so on to make sure that you are ready to move all your assets over. And the other considerations also, if you see that you're working on a new type of asset, you might not want to move your current assay over because the cost of the validation is might be outpacing what it costs or the cost reduction you get by moving it over to the other. So that's encouraging for us because we are seeing that many of the assets that the customers are moving over actually are either bigger panels or deeper sequencing, and thereby the elasticity is still working out. And now we are expecting our customers to do that. I mean, that's under our expectations that we are seeing. As we say, more than 40% of our placements are with clinical, and we expect that to continue to grow over the next period of time. So I know there is a concern out there that we certainly see a cliff. That's not how we see it. That's not how we speak to our customers. We are seeing this to be a transition that is happening, and it will be staged over time and thereby follow the trajectory we have seen over the past quarters of transition.\nAnkur Dhingra: And, Tycho, so far during the transition, and I granted I've been here six months, I've seen two quarters, but every time customers are transitioning, the elasticity and the higher throughput that's going through the instrumentation is kind of playing out. The thesis I laid out during the Strategy Day, we just saw a little bit of acceleration of that during the quarter. We still saw very solid GB shift growth, and given the higher transition, we did see a higher price impact. But all-in-all, despite that, we were able to grow our consumables at a high single-digit rate this quarter because a larger portion of the business has now transitioned into X, right? I'm talking more than 55, so over half of the volumes already transitioned. That puts us in a good position that a larger part of the GB growth starts translating into revenue.\nJacob Thaysen: And, by the way, Tycho, also on your question about what you call the multi-year contracts, I think you are referring to what we call the open offer letter, and this is not instrument specific, so those contracts are also in place or will continue with the X.\nOperator: We'll move up next to David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: So I'm going to build on both of Doug's questions, I guess that was Doug and Tycho's question just here on the elasticity of demand. I'm sorry to belabor this point, but that cliff is a big topic we're getting from investors. So can you maybe give us some sort of conceptualization in terms of new assays to market or anything like that, that'll help us flavor the fact that this whole GB is actually getting, that these whole flow cells are actually playing out to a net positive revenue there. I know you've already given a lot of color, but it still is a little bit of a build I want to make on that. And then just on the fourth quarter seasonality here, to build on that part of the question, I think there's only been one year where Q4 was lower than Q3. Can you just talk about maybe some of the budget flush dynamics that are not happening in the quarter? I know there's obviously a low throughput weight on that one. However, low throughput is a percent of capital sales. I mean, it's fairly tiny on the overall P&L. So thank you very much.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, David. let me let me go into that. I think there's two things to think about if you if you see those assays. I think I've definitely spoken to customers that have decided to make bigger assays. So if they have an oncology assay, they have decided to add more markers on, but also maybe methylation markers on all the things that require substantially deeper sequencing. So we see that happening right now. And on top of that, what should really be encouraging is that we are, as Ankur was also saying, we continue to see the strong volume uptake for both clinical and for academic customer segments. So it really speaks to that, that while the X is offering and most of that volume is obviously coming from the X. So even though that that the X is offering lower price, we see the elasticity actually works for both of the clinical and the research market. We are not seeing a lot of customers right now that is just shifting over and stay with the same volume. Most of them are transitioning to the X and also creating more volume. Ankur, do you want to?\nAnkur Dhingra: No, that's great. In terms of your seasonality questions there, in our guide, if you're thinking sequentially, I think that instruments, given that we're holding at minus mid, what, minus 30% decline sequentially, the instruments would still be up relative to Q3 and my seasonality comment around a decline Q3 to Q4 was more for consumables with lesser number of working days, driving potentially lower testing and inventory, et cetera. One of the other things I would remind everyone, I think we've said this before, our X consumables have a relatively shorter shelf life still relative to what was for 6K. So some of those inventory dynamics might play out for the end of the year. If there are lesser number of tests to be performed or there's lesser number of working days, our customers may choose to manage their inventory accordingly.\nOperator: We'll go next to Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets.\nConor McNamara: I'm just following up on just the overall revenue guidance change, works out to 20 million to 25 million, I think, for the year and I'm assuming most of that's in Q4. Is it safe to assume that's all in instruments? And if so, can you kind of give a breakdown of where you're seeing, is that all in the low and mid throughput or where else are the pockets where you're taking revenue out of guidance?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, good question. And you're right, it is in the range that you're talking about overall if you think of it from a relative to midpoint perspective. And just to back up, we're effectively, when we looked at our business in Q3 and the pace at which we closed, very, very pleased with how the consumables panned out. But when we look at the instrumentation side and the pace at which deals with closing, the pace at which we look at the funnel, we look at the closures, our sales team comes back and gives us the input. And that pace has been more variable off late. And that is the fundamental reason behind us going back and saying if the same environment -- if the same variability continues, it's hard to kind of put a pin on saying how much the year-end business is going to be. But that was the fundamental thought process behind the guidance change. And we kind of pointed as we worked through it, we figured there's a better way to think about this landing closer to the lower end of our TVS guidance rather than the midpoint. And that's how we landed closer to that 10.70-ish mark approximately. Now as we look at our different components, I would for modeling purpose kind of take them out roughly equally from instruments, consumables and our services businesses. That's probably a good way to do it because we're thinking from a deal closure velocity perspective rather than pointing to weakness in a certain area overall. So you could take it out a third out of all three. And the reason I'm also specifically saying out of services is because we do have certain CDX deals. As you know, our TSO comp assay was recently approved by FDA. We have a few CDS agreements that are tied to that. Milestones related to those CDS agreements are getting pushed into next year. So I would probably feather about a third equally across the three lines.\nOperator: We'll move next to Dan Arias with Stiefel.\nDan Arias: Jacob, you guys have pretty consistently called out the macro environment of the headwind to placements throughout the year. It doesn't feel like there's a big change coming when the calendar flips and we're now in 2025. So how are you getting comfortable with the headwind actually abating? What should we look for as a shift that can impact the placement rate positively?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, you're definitely right, Dan. I can't wait for the day that none of us have to talk about macro headwinds in these calls here. And I do think that as we mentioned before, we do think that at least from Illumina perspective, the consumables growth is the early indicator that things are starting to turn around. That said, I mean, if I look, as we mentioned strategy day, it's at this point easier to look a few years out because we can see that in our models while we transition the business over to the X. But it's still very difficult to call quarter-by-quarter at this point or beyond a quarter at this point. But that said, we actually are seeing improvements, green shots, shoots in different parts. As you say, the consumables are looking better. We believe that the MiSeq i100 is giving us some momentum. But tomorrow is going to change everything again with the election coming up. So let's see. And we're taking quarter-by-quarter right now.\nAnkur Dhingra: So the only one thing I would add then is, as Jacob was saying, consumables is the right leading indicator for us. And some of our thesis around consumables returning to growth and then providing the foundation going forward, it's kind of playing out in the back half here. The instrumentation, yes, as Jacob said, we have to kind of see it play out.\nOperator: We'll move next to Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Ankur, probably one for you on the margin side. It's nice to see the gross margins back above 70 this quarter. Can you just talk about the cost savings programs? Obviously, you have the $100 million this year, how that's progressing. And then that incremental $200 as we look forward, just the pacing of it. Obviously, we have that longer-term up-margin guidance of the 500 bps or so over the next three years. But can you just talk about, I guess, the impact next year on the cost-saving side and then any offsets that we should think about on margins as we just think of that high-level framework for 2025, any headwinds that we should be aware of would be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So before Ankur goes into the details of the specifics here, I just want to mention again that the result we're seeing today is a very intentional focus on the whole company, Illumina, since I came in here, of really putting an effort, saying, look, there might be still a period ahead where we will be challenged on the top line. But in the meantime, we really want to set up the culture for the right focus on operational excellence and make sure we make the right priorities to both drive efficiencies in the company but also drive a much better way to run the company. And that goes way beyond just looking into operations. It goes from the commercial organization all the way through R&D operations and everything we do. And I truly believe, as I said before, this is what good companies do. And that won't change the day that we see substantially top-line improvements. I truly believe this is what a good company will look like also in the future and how we drive the culture. So, Ankur, you want to go into the details?\nAnkur Dhingra: No, thanks, Jacob. And that is playing out right now in the last six months as we've come in, relaying the same message across the organization, laying our plans for where some of the savings could come from. But also, culturally, what we're also seeing is that the teams are the ones now, from a bottom-up perspective, starting to come up with initiatives, starting to come up with ideas around where the potential productivity gains could be, which is exactly where we want to drive this culture. So, very pleased with how this is heading. Now, to your question, feel good about the $100 million savings this year. If you simply look at the guidance overall, even at that 10.70 in our operating margin, we're talking about a 3% revenue decline year over year and a pretty substantial margin expansion, now more heavily focused towards gross margin during this year. And we've been able to substantially offset all of our inflationary or a good part of our inflationary pressures during 2024. So, feel good about that $100 million during this year. For the $200 million going forward or the 500 basis point margin expansion, as I said, during the Strategy Day, our focus will continue to take costs out of both COGS as well as operating expenses. We have a series of strategies, some already in execution and some in the early stages of execution around setting up global capability centers. We've moved our shipping line changes. We're consolidating some parts of our manufacturing lines into specific sites. We're looking at our R&D programs, et cetera. So, across the board that we're looking at. And in terms of where are we reinvesting, we'll likely reinvest in our sales and marketing a little bit more than where we are today. In terms of headwinds going forward, I don't see anything beyond the usual inflationary pressure, right? Every year, there will be a merit and an inflation that will come in and we'll find ways to offset that as part of taking out our expenses. But all-in-all, going back to our strategy of expanding 500 basis points over the next three years, I feel good about that.\nOperator: We'll go next to Subha Nambi with Guggenheim.\nSubha Nambi: You generated almost $300 million in free cash flow. Anything abnormal in the quarter? Where does this go from here? And are there enough levels to drive robust FCF from these levels? And building off of that, would you consider a more aggressive buyback at current levels?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, Subha. Thanks for that. And first of all, I'm, of course, very pleased where we are now with our cash generation, and especially here after we focused the company back into our core business. And I think you can start to see that the model is starting to work. We're creating a good amount, excellent cash generation. And as we also mentioned at our Strategy Day, that we will start to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And you will see us in this quarter. We have started to do so. Where our focus would be both, of course, on stock repurchases, but also, of course, on M&A. And we did both in this quarter with the acquisition of Fluent, which we finalized in this quarter here, but also, of course, started to buy back shares. So, Ankur?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. Thanks, Jacob. And thanks for the question, Subha, very happy with the cash generation profile of the business. Nothing material unusual in terms of if you're thinking about net income to FCF conversion. I anticipate to remain well above that 100, but even closer to 150%, I think is what it is this quarter in that kind of territory here in the near term. So, very, very healthy cash generation just from a business perspective. Over a period of time, when you think about the next three to four-year time frame, I do expect the FCF conversion to narrow a little bit. And part of it is going to be as we take different expense controls as we manage our capital expenses, some of our depreciation and our stock-based compensation, et cetera, will also come down. And those two are some of the components that lead to the higher FCF conversion. Now, I still expect it to remain well above 100% overall. So, strong cash generation position. And as you saw, we've started, Jacob was saying, started putting that cash to use. And that's our intent. We do intend to start deploying this cash back to the core business towards growing revenue as well as buying back shares. So, on the share buybacks and the overall strategy, what we laid out during the Strategy Day was that our focus is heavily towards revenue growth. We do want to buy back shares at least to the extent of our anti-dilution to keep the share count at least constant and then be opportunistic thereafter. On the M&A side, we intend to remain focused on tuck-in type of M&A, things that can be revenue-accretive for our businesses and bring in those technologies. And then continue to manage our balance sheet tightly. We de-levered a little bit this quarter. Now, we don't have any other bonds coming due here in the short-term, but we'll continue to manage the balance sheet quite conservatively from there on.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\nSung Ji Nam: Just wondering if you might be able to elaborate a bit more on the end market dynamics, specifically Europe relative to the Americas. If you look at Europe, your growth this year has been pretty steady both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm just kind of curious what the drivers might be there, if they're any different from what you're seeing in the Americas from a macro perspective. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: You're absolutely right. We're certainly pleased with our European performance. It's great to see that even under some tough challenges, conditions also in Europe that we have seen very consistent results. And we anticipate that that will continue over the next period of time. If you look into Americas, to the U.S., that's also where we have higher pressure in the mid-throughput from a competitive situation, but also where we placed substantially more of the X instrument last year, and thereby the compare has been a little more tough in U.S. than it was in Europe. So we anticipate that we will continue to look strong in Europe going forward, and the compares will be a little bit easier for U.S. going forward.\nOperator: We'll move next to Mason Carrico with Stephens.\nBen Mee: Hi, this is Ben on for Mason. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you'd be able to maybe dive into the opportunity in single cell. And if you could just talk through how you see your ownership of Fluent, either growing the overall served addressable market, or sort of taking share from some other players out in the space. Just if you could talk through those balancing forces there, that'd be great. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, thanks for that. And we're certainly excited with the Fluent acquisition, and truly believe that we'll be able to build a very, very strong workflow that will help many of our customers. As you know, since you don't need to have a capital layout in the beginning, you can actually get very easy into to do single cell experiment. And also, the cost per cell experiment for a very high volume is also allowing for really huge amount of single cell experience. So I actually think that the Fluent acquisition is helping to expand the market opportunity for all of us. And at the same time, even though we now, Illumina has, we have our own sample prep for single cell, we are very committed to support our current partners to make them very successful on our platforms. Our fundamental focus is to help our customers to be successful in single cell. I truly believe single cell is going to be a huge cornerstone, first and foremost, in research over the next period of time. And there's a tremendous insight that you get through single cell. So I'm actually very bullish on the single cell opportunity. And I truly believe by focusing on our customers and what they need and make sure we can serve them, whether they choose the Fluent or some of our partners, we will make sure they're successful. And that will make all of us successful going forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Leonard with UBS.\nDan Leonard: I could use some help trying to better frame the impact of the MiSeq 100 launch. What's been the growth trend in that low throughput sales category? And that might be helpful as I think about what would be the impact if that changes. And then a follow up on the XLEAP launch on the NextSeq. What's been the impact of that launch? Has that impacted the sales trajectory of consumables on that mid throughput line at all?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, so let me start with the MiSeq. I mean, we certainly MiSeq i100, we are very excited about bringing a new instrument solution out to the low throughput end of the market. As you know, it is more than 10 years ago since we came out with the MiSeq and now the MiSeq i100 is going to be absolutely the best solution in that part of the market. We are really focusing on to make it easy to use, to make it easy to operate from. You don't have to store reagents or ship reagents or consumables in the freezer anymore. And that actually makes it much easier since you can take them directly. You can wrap up, open the package and use the consumables immediately instead of having to prepare for that. So we expect this to be very well received from our customers. And we actually think that some of the customers that potentially would have gone after a mid-throughput instrument might actually decide to go with the MiSeq i100 because it creates such a benefit from them. As you could imagine also, since our portfolio in the low throughput was in, it was time for an update, we have seen some weakening performance in that space. And thereby, we do believe that over the next 12 to 18 months, we will see a pickup in that space. As we also said before, we are not really seeing that to be meaningfully impacting Q4, but we expect that to start to have impact in 2025.\nAnkur Dhingra: Just to dimensionalize it for you, Dan, the low throughput instruments business on dollar terms is less than 1% or close to 1% of our revenue. So it's an exciting technology that [Box] [ph] has been around for over 10 plus years now. And the kind of interest that we're getting is substantial. We're also getting additional call points with customers to talk about an entire portfolio as well. But in terms of moving the overall revenue number for Illumina, just to help you dimensionalize that.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. And then on the active chemistry, we have seen a lot of interest in that. We have more than 60% of our NextSeq 1K, 2K users that have downloaded the software and thereby also starting to use chemistry. So that has been very well received. We will continue to stay and be very committed to be competitive in the mid-throughput market. And I'm very excited about the future in that market also.\nOperator: And that will conclude our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investor section of our website. This concludes our call. And we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events.\nOperator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time. And have a great day.",

            "name": "Ankur Dhingra",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll give you an overview of our financial results, provide more color about revenue, expenses, earnings, and developments on our balance sheet, and then speak about our outlook going forward. All financial information, including guidance that we shared on this call, is for Core Illumina only and excludes GRAIL. During the third quarter, Illumina's revenue of $1.08 billion was in line with our expectations, and the team delivered a very strong margin and earnings expansion through ongoing cost discipline and operational excellence. Cash generation remains strong, and we also put cash to use across all dimensions of our capital allocation strategy. Now I will add color to each of these items. Third quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, with strong growth in our consumables business offset by the instruments business declining against launch year compares. Sequencing consumables revenue was $741 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued strong uptake in X consumables. The NovaSeq X transition progressed faster than we forecasted. As of end of Q3, more than 55% of high throughput gigabases sequenced and more than 35% of high throughput consumables revenue was on the NovaSeq X series. We saw some acceleration of the transition from 6K to X this quarter, including in clinical as approximately 40% of high throughput clinical gigabases sequenced were on the NovaSeq X series. As legacy assays transition to the X series, we have seen increased clinical volumes and increasing adoption of the 25B flow cell from clinical customers. While there will be some quarterly variations in the pace of transition based on choices our customers make, we still believe almost half of high throughput consumables revenue could transition to the X series by middle of 2025. Moving to sequencing activity, total sequencing GB output on our connected high and mid throughput instruments continue to grow at a rate more than 40% year-over-year, with robust growth from both clinical and research customers. Sequencing instruments revenue was $104 million for Q3, a 42% year-over-year decline, slightly behind our expectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by two factors. One, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant pre-order launch related shipments in the third quarter of 2023. And two, a decline in mid throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements globally. Sequencing service and other revenue was $150 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships as well as high instrument service contract revenue on a growing install base. Moving to the rest of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin of 70.5% for the quarter increased 450 basis points year-over-year. This strong gross margin performance was driven primarily by the execution of our operational excellence initiatives that continue to improve productivity and deliver cost savings. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was also supported by a more favorable revenue mix of sequencing consumables, making up roughly half of that improvement. While the business mix will change on quarter-to-quarter basis, the productivity improvements we have achieved are sustainable and will support our margin expansion going forward. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $517 million were roughly flat to last quarter. This includes the additional headcount and expenses resulting from our acquisition of Fluent BioSciences. The Illumina team continues to manage expenses effectively. As I mentioned during our strategy update, we have several actions in play to reprioritize and reduce our expenses. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.6% compared to the 22.5% in the prior year period. This came in well above our guidance of approximately 20%, driven by strong operational performance across gross margin and discipline and expenses. Below the operating income line, non-GAAP other expense was $14 million in Q3. During the quarter, we issued $500 million in debt at a 4.65% coupon that was used, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full the high-cost $750 million delayed broad term loan, effectively de-levering and also reducing our interest rate. Non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter. In Q3, we received the benefit of a few one-time credits as we filed our return for last year. Putting it all together, non-GAAP net income for Q3 was $181 million for diluted earnings per share for $1.14 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 160 million shares. Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter, cash flow provided by operations was healthy at $316 million. Capital expenditures were $32 million, and free cash flow was $284 million. During the quarter, we put cash to work in line with our stated capital allocation strategy. We acquired Fluent BioSciences, adding innovative instrument-free single-cell technology to Illumina's portfolio. We're excited about the potential for very large single-cell experiments this technology can enable. In addition, following authorization from our board earlier this quarter, we put a share repurchase program in place and repurchased 770,000 shares of Illumina stock for $98 million at an average price of $127.71 per share. And as noted, we de-levered. Taken together, these capital actions show the strength of our operational execution in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $939 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. In summary, revenue was in line with expectations. The transition of high-throughput sequencing to the NovaSeq X is going quite well. We announced breakthrough new products in low throughput. We made significant progress towards our stated goal of margin expansion, and we have been deploying our strong cash flow towards revenue growth, improved earnings, and shareholder-friendly capital actions. Moving now to 2024 guidance. Although our overall Q3 revenue results met our expectations, we are tempering our revenue expectations for year-end business and now expect full-year revenue to be down approximately 3%. For Q4, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.07 billion. We continue to see strong utilization levels and pull through on our instruments, but the near-term macroeconomic environment remains constrained and does not support any uptick in purchasing behavior through the end of the year. From an instruments versus consumables perspective, the projected mix is unchanged, and we're still forecasting instrument revenue to decline in the mid-30s percentage range relative to 2023. Although we are very excited about MiSeq 100, it is in early access, and we will receive minimal revenue contribution in Q4. As we had planned for, our low-throughput instrument business will likely decline in Q4, with customers waiting for the new instrument. For high throughput, we still expect second-half NovaSeq X shipments to be above what we delivered in the first half of 2024. We also still forecast sequencing consumables revenue to grow towards the upper end of the low single-digit percentage range versus 2023. We saw strong uptake and GB usage in the third quarter, setting the stage for exiting the year with solid year-over-year consumables growth. While we're disappointed in our lower revenue guidance, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin and diluted EPS, reflecting both the outperformance in Q3 and carrying forward the impact of our operational excellence initiatives into Q4. We are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a range of 21% to 21.5% for 2024. We are reducing our projected tax rate for the year to approximately 24%. And lastly, we're raising our guidance range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $4.05 to $4.15 range for full year 2024. With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. This is Ankur. Doug, on the other part, specifically to your question about the guidance for Q4 consumables, our guide right now assumes a typical seasonal decline from Q3 to Q4 in consumables. As you know, there are lots of holidays during Q4 relative to the other quarters. I looked back and looked at the trends for the last few years as well. And seasonally, the consumables purchases do kind of follow that seasonal pattern down in Q4, and that's what I'm assuming in the guide right now. Nothing underlying from a transition perspective or a clinical transition, et cetera, perspective there, simple seasonality. Yes, absolutely. So, Vijay, I think I answered the first question in between around that price thing. Yes, it was in that 25-percentage range. You've said that if the transition from 6K to X, since it accelerated, this quarter we did see the price impact towards the higher end of that range, closer towards 25 rather than 20, but it was still within that model range. Now, around the margins, I can tell you I'm very pleased with the results. As I think about the 500 basis points, and I'm thinking of 21% as the base to work off that 500 basis point expansion, it's premised on two things, right? Our ability to expand our gross margins and be in that high 60s to 70% range. And what the team has been able to do here is crank up that model and get us, start giving us a view of what the model could be as we keep driving it higher. We still have lots of opportunity to take cost out within COGS to structurally get closer to that 70%. For now, this quarter, higher mix was certainly beneficial. And then on the OPEC side, again, several levers still, but I think working off of that 21% and where we land this quarter and how we're looking at 2024 to end, I feel very good about the progress that we're making. Yes. I think I can, I don't know if you're breaking that out very clearly, but overall our consumables growth was up 6% for the quarter and then both research and clinical grew nicely. There wasn't a dramatic shift between the two. Yes. The sequence. Yes. Yes. I misspoke. The consumables growth for the quarter is 7%, not 6%. And yes, the research and clinical are both growing nicely. And, Tycho, so far during the transition, and I granted I've been here six months, I've seen two quarters, but every time customers are transitioning, the elasticity and the higher throughput that's going through the instrumentation is kind of playing out. The thesis I laid out during the Strategy Day, we just saw a little bit of acceleration of that during the quarter. We still saw very solid GB shift growth, and given the higher transition, we did see a higher price impact. But all-in-all, despite that, we were able to grow our consumables at a high single-digit rate this quarter because a larger portion of the business has now transitioned into X, right? I'm talking more than 55, so over half of the volumes already transitioned. That puts us in a good position that a larger part of the GB growth starts translating into revenue. No, that's great. In terms of your seasonality questions there, in our guide, if you're thinking sequentially, I think that instruments, given that we're holding at minus mid, what, minus 30% decline sequentially, the instruments would still be up relative to Q3 and my seasonality comment around a decline Q3 to Q4 was more for consumables with lesser number of working days, driving potentially lower testing and inventory, et cetera. One of the other things I would remind everyone, I think we've said this before, our X consumables have a relatively shorter shelf life still relative to what was for 6K. So some of those inventory dynamics might play out for the end of the year. If there are lesser number of tests to be performed or there's lesser number of working days, our customers may choose to manage their inventory accordingly. Yes, good question. And you're right, it is in the range that you're talking about overall if you think of it from a relative to midpoint perspective. And just to back up, we're effectively, when we looked at our business in Q3 and the pace at which we closed, very, very pleased with how the consumables panned out. But when we look at the instrumentation side and the pace at which deals with closing, the pace at which we look at the funnel, we look at the closures, our sales team comes back and gives us the input. And that pace has been more variable off late. And that is the fundamental reason behind us going back and saying if the same environment -- if the same variability continues, it's hard to kind of put a pin on saying how much the year-end business is going to be. But that was the fundamental thought process behind the guidance change. And we kind of pointed as we worked through it, we figured there's a better way to think about this landing closer to the lower end of our TVS guidance rather than the midpoint. And that's how we landed closer to that 10.70-ish mark approximately. Now as we look at our different components, I would for modeling purpose kind of take them out roughly equally from instruments, consumables and our services businesses. That's probably a good way to do it because we're thinking from a deal closure velocity perspective rather than pointing to weakness in a certain area overall. So you could take it out a third out of all three. And the reason I'm also specifically saying out of services is because we do have certain CDX deals. As you know, our TSO comp assay was recently approved by FDA. We have a few CDS agreements that are tied to that. Milestones related to those CDS agreements are getting pushed into next year. So I would probably feather about a third equally across the three lines. So the only one thing I would add then is, as Jacob was saying, consumables is the right leading indicator for us. And some of our thesis around consumables returning to growth and then providing the foundation going forward, it's kind of playing out in the back half here. The instrumentation, yes, as Jacob said, we have to kind of see it play out. No, thanks, Jacob. And that is playing out right now in the last six months as we've come in, relaying the same message across the organization, laying our plans for where some of the savings could come from. But also, culturally, what we're also seeing is that the teams are the ones now, from a bottom-up perspective, starting to come up with initiatives, starting to come up with ideas around where the potential productivity gains could be, which is exactly where we want to drive this culture. So, very pleased with how this is heading. Now, to your question, feel good about the $100 million savings this year. If you simply look at the guidance overall, even at that 10.70 in our operating margin, we're talking about a 3% revenue decline year over year and a pretty substantial margin expansion, now more heavily focused towards gross margin during this year. And we've been able to substantially offset all of our inflationary or a good part of our inflationary pressures during 2024. So, feel good about that $100 million during this year. For the $200 million going forward or the 500 basis point margin expansion, as I said, during the Strategy Day, our focus will continue to take costs out of both COGS as well as operating expenses. We have a series of strategies, some already in execution and some in the early stages of execution around setting up global capability centers. We've moved our shipping line changes. We're consolidating some parts of our manufacturing lines into specific sites. We're looking at our R&D programs, et cetera. So, across the board that we're looking at. And in terms of where are we reinvesting, we'll likely reinvest in our sales and marketing a little bit more than where we are today. In terms of headwinds going forward, I don't see anything beyond the usual inflationary pressure, right? Every year, there will be a merit and an inflation that will come in and we'll find ways to offset that as part of taking out our expenses. But all-in-all, going back to our strategy of expanding 500 basis points over the next three years, I feel good about that. Yes. Thanks, Jacob. And thanks for the question, Subha, very happy with the cash generation profile of the business. Nothing material unusual in terms of if you're thinking about net income to FCF conversion. I anticipate to remain well above that 100, but even closer to 150%, I think is what it is this quarter in that kind of territory here in the near term. So, very, very healthy cash generation just from a business perspective. Over a period of time, when you think about the next three to four-year time frame, I do expect the FCF conversion to narrow a little bit. And part of it is going to be as we take different expense controls as we manage our capital expenses, some of our depreciation and our stock-based compensation, et cetera, will also come down. And those two are some of the components that lead to the higher FCF conversion. Now, I still expect it to remain well above 100% overall. So, strong cash generation position. And as you saw, we've started, Jacob was saying, started putting that cash to use. And that's our intent. We do intend to start deploying this cash back to the core business towards growing revenue as well as buying back shares. So, on the share buybacks and the overall strategy, what we laid out during the Strategy Day was that our focus is heavily towards revenue growth. We do want to buy back shares at least to the extent of our anti-dilution to keep the share count at least constant and then be opportunistic thereafter. On the M&A side, we intend to remain focused on tuck-in type of M&A, things that can be revenue-accretive for our businesses and bring in those technologies. And then continue to manage our balance sheet tightly. We de-levered a little bit this quarter. Now, we don't have any other bonds coming due here in the short-term, but we'll continue to manage the balance sheet quite conservatively from there on. Just to dimensionalize it for you, Dan, the low throughput instruments business on dollar terms is less than 1% or close to 1% of our revenue. So it's an exciting technology that [Box] [ph] has been around for over 10 plus years now. And the kind of interest that we're getting is substantial. We're also getting additional call points with customers to talk about an entire portfolio as well. But in terms of moving the overall revenue number for Illumina, just to help you dimensionalize that."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Illumina delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. We are making significant progress in expanding margins and driving earnings, growing the utilization of the NovaSeq X platform, and bringing the next phase of sequencing innovation to our customers. In Q3, revenue was $1.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Across our regions, America's revenue was down 6% year-over-year, Europe revenue was up 12%, EMEA revenue was up 7%, and Greater China was down 23%. In the quarter, we placed an additional 58 NovaSeq X Plus instruments, bringing our total installed base to 527. Approximately 40% of this installed base has been shipped to clinical customers, highlighting the diversity of our user base. The X-Series surpassed $1 billion in cumulative revenue, a major milestone. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 22.6% and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, exceeding our expectations, and we began executing on the capital allocation strategy we laid out at our August Strategy Update. Looking ahead through year-end, while the funds remain healthy, the near-term macroeconomic environment has been persistently constrained. We now expect our 2024 revenue growth to be slightly lower than our prior guidance range. However, we are raising our guidance for both 2024 operating margin and earnings per share, reflecting the significant progress we have made so far this year in our transformative journey, driving operational excellence and strengthening our culture of performance. Ankur will provide additional details during his remarks. During our August Strategy Update, we laid out a plan to drive high single-digit revenue growth and 500 basis points of operating margin expansions by 2027, while achieving annual EPS growth in the double-digits to teens over the next three years. To achieve this, I've set key priorities to guide execution against our strategy, deeper customer collaboration, continuous innovation, and commitment to operational excellence and margin expansion. Our first priority, deeper customer collaboration, is centered on providing a range of targeted solutions to serve the increasingly diverse needs of our customer base. Over the past several months, I've continued connecting with our customers worldwide. Most recently, this included a group of academic core lab directors that have a long legacy of collaboration with Illumina and are some of our most experienced users. I'm grateful to them for their ongoing partnership and support. As we evolve the way we engage with customers, we have focused on two key initiatives. One, shifting how we interact and collaborate with customers to support their ambitions. My observation was that we needed to do better in this area. And now I'm beginning to hear from customers that they are seeing Illumina present itself in a new way. And two, giving customers a clear line of sight to the significant innovations we have in the pipeline. Their early input is invaluable, allowing us to develop the most impactful products and solutions in the industry. I'm pleased to see this partner mindset become increasingly embedded into our company's culture. It will serve as a cornerstone of our success going forward. Our second priority is continuous innovation, which follows naturally from our first priority as it is driven and shaped by what customers are telling us they need. For example, we recently announced the launch of the groundbreaking MiSeq i100. We are addressing demand for flexible solutions for smaller scale projects with faster turnaround time. Early feedback is validating our approach of bringing customers into the fold as advisors throughout the product development process. Customers are excited about room temperature shipping and storage arrangements, allowing for sequencing on demand without the need to store reagents. The shorter runtimes paired with 18 proven end-to-end workflows are what our customers have been asking for. And they have expressed that this is a game changer. Over time, we intend to leverage these new technologies in future releases across our portfolio. MiSeq i100 instruments for early access customers will begin shipping in late Q4, driven by the strong demand we saw in the days following the announcements. At our strategy update, we shared a number of additional innovation, including comprehensive whole genome sequencing and our five-phase genome that will launch over the next 12 to 18 months. Collectively, these technologies will reinvent genome while making NGS workflow easier. Comprehensive whole genome solution leverages a novel constellation map read technology to add additional layers of genomic data, redefining the extent of information created by the SPS chemistry. Standard library prep is eliminated as it is performed directly on the flow cell, going from multiple hours of hands-on time to just a few minutes. Another customer-driven innovation is the five-phase genome, which will provide variant and epigenetic information from a single library prep. Customers will have access to methylation information in every run, which is important to understand diseases, including cancer, obesity, and infectious diseases. Both the five-phase genome and constellation map read technology solutions are currently in development, with customers providing feedback that will influence our product advancements. We will be providing further details on these two innovations, including results from early access customers at upcoming industry events like ASHG later this week. In the near term, Illumina continues to deliver innovations for the NovaSeq X Series. We remain on track to begin shipping the single-flow cell NovaSeq X by the end of this year. This instrument will be upgradable to the NovaSeq X+. In Q4, we will introduce 100-cycle and 200-cycle 25B flow cells designed for high-output counting applications, such as single-cell and proteomics. Our third priority is operational excellence. Our focus here is to build a foundation that powers our long-term success, regardless of the top line. By enhancing productivity, optimizing our investment spend, and driving smart capital allocation, we are positioning Illumina to directly benefit not only our customers and the patients they serve, but also our employees and our shareholders. Indeed, we have made great progress in building a culture where every employee is driving efficiencies to contribute to operational excellence. Now I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our third quarter results and outlook. Thanks, Ankur. As I reflect on my first year, I'm excited for the early progress Illumina has made and the momentum we have created to drive the industry forward. We refocused the company on our strong core business and launched our new strategy. We reset the leadership team and made the necessary structural changes to support our customer-first orientation. We have been increasingly embedding operational excellence in our culture, and the results are beginning to show in our financials. This is a good start to our multi-year transformation journey. For 2025, we are looking forward to returning to growth, although I would like to finish Q4 before providing specific guidance. Ultimately, I'm encouraged and feel confident in bringing Illumina back to high single-digit revenue growth by 2027, as stated during our strategy update. Thank you for joining today. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A. Yes, thanks for that. I've heard this clinical cliff a few times, and I don't think that's the way we look at the business right now. I think, first and foremost, we are, of course, excited to see that there continues to be strong momentum moving towards the X. As Ankur was mentioning earlier that we are seeing the strong momentum. We are seeing a lot of volume moving towards the X. So, everything is pointing into the direction that we were also presenting at the Strategy Day. As you also mentioned, we did take down, and we were tweaking the guidance here for coming out of Q3 into Q4. As we did not see, even though we see a very healthy instrument funnel, we're not seeing the normal end-of-year activity that we would normally see. But as you're also mentioning, we actually saw a very nice uptake in our revenue for the consumables. I think that's also what we mentioned before, is a strong indicator for that we are seeing the trajectory of moving towards the X. With the specifics on clinical and on how we have transparency to our customers, we do spend, actually, quite a lot of time, especially with our larger customers. As I mentioned before, we are spending a lot of time, actually, to work closely with them to understand where they're going to actually go deeper into where we are with our funnel and what we have in our R&D pipeline, so they can get prepared to transition when we come out with new technologies. That goes both for our academic customers, but certainly also our clinical customers. We also have a quite good understanding on what the different projects they're looking into and when they're transitioning over to the X. Now, I would say that if I just look at it from a high-level perspective, we don't see a lot of customers that are going from completely 6K and over to X in a few months. This is normally assay by assay, and it takes time. It usually takes a year, if not 18 months, to transition over to the X. But what Ankur was also saying, we've seen more than 40% of the volume now for the clinical accounts. Okay. Thanks for that. And I think, Puneet, let me start with the first one, is that I think we continue to see a lot of competition across the world. I'm actually quite encouraged with China. As you might recall, we have a new leader coming in almost six months ago in China, and Jenny has done a fantastic job to reset the organization, reconfigure the organization, also reset our relationship with many of our partners, and including also looking at different type of pricing strategy. And I think we're starting to see that actually working now, meaning that we are starting to see that sequentially we are seeing flat revenue there, so at least we are starting to see a change in pattern in China. It's too early to call it up. Competition in the rest of the world, you're absolutely right that we are seeing most competition in the mid-throughput. I will say that we take that very seriously, I've said that before, but I actually think it's something that keeps us on the toes here, and it's something that I truly believe is important as a company to have competition. It makes us more agile, it makes us better in front of our customers, so I enjoy that. I will say that if you look into the performance of the mid-throughput itself, I had a conversation the other day, as I also mentioned, with the academic Core Lab directors, and during those conversations we were also looking to where they're getting their business from, and we see more and more of, they see a lot of customers, small biotech companies, all the small companies that previously would buy a likely mid-throughput instrument and do sequencing themselves, due to their financial constraints right now, many of them are outsourcing, and we still see, and thereby those lab directors will see more of that business. And for us, as we mentioned before, the macroeconomic is still the majority of the pressure we see in the mid-throughput. So if you look into 2025, I think we would still like to see end of this year before we go deeper into our considerations into 2025. But that said, as I mentioned, in the strategy day, we are expecting, we're still very committed to that we will end at high single-digit growth by 2027, as we also mentioned, we were stepping ourselves into that, and we expect to go from 2024, where we had negative growth here, and then step into positive growth regime in 2025. Well, first, thanks for that, Vijay, and I'll have Ankur to talk a little bit about the specific in the guidance here, but I will say that I'm very encouraged to see us delivering on our GM growth margin, but also our operating margin and EPS. I think it speaks a volume to the Illumina team and the company we want to be, that in tough times, we're also able to deliver significant progress in our margin expansion. So I'm excited about that, and I think it should give certain very strong proof points that we are highly committed to deliver on the 500-basis point that we set out to do at the Strategy Day. But, Ankur, do you want to remind where we are? Yes. So at this point, we're not providing actual placement for mid-throughput. We will give you an update for the full year at the JPMorgan as we usually do. And I think, Ankur, maybe you're a little, you want to go back on margins? Yes. We would like, as I mentioned, we would like to do the guide when we are, when we're ready to do that by the beginning of the year. So overall, we are, of course, pleased with that we continue to see our customers move towards X. We believe that the X platform is providing substantial benefit from our customers, both from a lower price point, but also the workflows that is able, combined with the Dragon compute power that we have and the interpretation power that we have. So there's a lot of reasons why our customers want to move on to the X. But as you also know, in the clinical space, you need to do a lot of work up front, validation and so on to make sure that you are ready to move all your assets over. And the other considerations also, if you see that you're working on a new type of asset, you might not want to move your current assay over because the cost of the validation is might be outpacing what it costs or the cost reduction you get by moving it over to the other. So that's encouraging for us because we are seeing that many of the assets that the customers are moving over actually are either bigger panels or deeper sequencing, and thereby the elasticity is still working out. And now we are expecting our customers to do that. I mean, that's under our expectations that we are seeing. As we say, more than 40% of our placements are with clinical, and we expect that to continue to grow over the next period of time. So I know there is a concern out there that we certainly see a cliff. That's not how we see it. That's not how we speak to our customers. We are seeing this to be a transition that is happening, and it will be staged over time and thereby follow the trajectory we have seen over the past quarters of transition. And, by the way, Tycho, also on your question about what you call the multi-year contracts, I think you are referring to what we call the open offer letter, and this is not instrument specific, so those contracts are also in place or will continue with the X. Yes, David. let me let me go into that. I think there's two things to think about if you if you see those assays. I think I've definitely spoken to customers that have decided to make bigger assays. So if they have an oncology assay, they have decided to add more markers on, but also maybe methylation markers on all the things that require substantially deeper sequencing. So we see that happening right now. And on top of that, what should really be encouraging is that we are, as Ankur was also saying, we continue to see the strong volume uptake for both clinical and for academic customer segments. So it really speaks to that, that while the X is offering and most of that volume is obviously coming from the X. So even though that that the X is offering lower price, we see the elasticity actually works for both of the clinical and the research market. We are not seeing a lot of customers right now that is just shifting over and stay with the same volume. Most of them are transitioning to the X and also creating more volume. Ankur, do you want to? Yes, you're definitely right, Dan. I can't wait for the day that none of us have to talk about macro headwinds in these calls here. And I do think that as we mentioned before, we do think that at least from Illumina perspective, the consumables growth is the early indicator that things are starting to turn around. That said, I mean, if I look, as we mentioned strategy day, it's at this point easier to look a few years out because we can see that in our models while we transition the business over to the X. But it's still very difficult to call quarter-by-quarter at this point or beyond a quarter at this point. But that said, we actually are seeing improvements, green shots, shoots in different parts. As you say, the consumables are looking better. We believe that the MiSeq i100 is giving us some momentum. But tomorrow is going to change everything again with the election coming up. So let's see. And we're taking quarter-by-quarter right now. Yes. So before Ankur goes into the details of the specifics here, I just want to mention again that the result we're seeing today is a very intentional focus on the whole company, Illumina, since I came in here, of really putting an effort, saying, look, there might be still a period ahead where we will be challenged on the top line. But in the meantime, we really want to set up the culture for the right focus on operational excellence and make sure we make the right priorities to both drive efficiencies in the company but also drive a much better way to run the company. And that goes way beyond just looking into operations. It goes from the commercial organization all the way through R&D operations and everything we do. And I truly believe, as I said before, this is what good companies do. And that won't change the day that we see substantially top-line improvements. I truly believe this is what a good company will look like also in the future and how we drive the culture. So, Ankur, you want to go into the details? Yes, Subha. Thanks for that. And first of all, I'm, of course, very pleased where we are now with our cash generation, and especially here after we focused the company back into our core business. And I think you can start to see that the model is starting to work. We're creating a good amount, excellent cash generation. And as we also mentioned at our Strategy Day, that we will start to execute on our capital allocation strategy. And you will see us in this quarter. We have started to do so. Where our focus would be both, of course, on stock repurchases, but also, of course, on M&A. And we did both in this quarter with the acquisition of Fluent, which we finalized in this quarter here, but also, of course, started to buy back shares. So, Ankur? You're absolutely right. We're certainly pleased with our European performance. It's great to see that even under some tough challenges, conditions also in Europe that we have seen very consistent results. And we anticipate that that will continue over the next period of time. If you look into Americas, to the U.S., that's also where we have higher pressure in the mid-throughput from a competitive situation, but also where we placed substantially more of the X instrument last year, and thereby the compare has been a little more tough in U.S. than it was in Europe. So we anticipate that we will continue to look strong in Europe going forward, and the compares will be a little bit easier for U.S. going forward. Yes, thanks for that. And we're certainly excited with the Fluent acquisition, and truly believe that we'll be able to build a very, very strong workflow that will help many of our customers. As you know, since you don't need to have a capital layout in the beginning, you can actually get very easy into to do single cell experiment. And also, the cost per cell experiment for a very high volume is also allowing for really huge amount of single cell experience. So I actually think that the Fluent acquisition is helping to expand the market opportunity for all of us. And at the same time, even though we now, Illumina has, we have our own sample prep for single cell, we are very committed to support our current partners to make them very successful on our platforms. Our fundamental focus is to help our customers to be successful in single cell. I truly believe single cell is going to be a huge cornerstone, first and foremost, in research over the next period of time. And there's a tremendous insight that you get through single cell. So I'm actually very bullish on the single cell opportunity. And I truly believe by focusing on our customers and what they need and make sure we can serve them, whether they choose the Fluent or some of our partners, we will make sure they're successful. And that will make all of us successful going forward. Yes, so let me start with the MiSeq. I mean, we certainly MiSeq i100, we are very excited about bringing a new instrument solution out to the low throughput end of the market. As you know, it is more than 10 years ago since we came out with the MiSeq and now the MiSeq i100 is going to be absolutely the best solution in that part of the market. We are really focusing on to make it easy to use, to make it easy to operate from. You don't have to store reagents or ship reagents or consumables in the freezer anymore. And that actually makes it much easier since you can take them directly. You can wrap up, open the package and use the consumables immediately instead of having to prepare for that. So we expect this to be very well received from our customers. And we actually think that some of the customers that potentially would have gone after a mid-throughput instrument might actually decide to go with the MiSeq i100 because it creates such a benefit from them. As you could imagine also, since our portfolio in the low throughput was in, it was time for an update, we have seen some weakening performance in that space. And thereby, we do believe that over the next 12 to 18 months, we will see a pickup in that space. As we also said before, we are not really seeing that to be meaningfully impacting Q4, but we expect that to start to have impact in 2025. Yes. And then on the active chemistry, we have seen a lot of interest in that. We have more than 60% of our NextSeq 1K, 2K users that have downloaded the software and thereby also starting to use chemistry. So that has been very well received. We will continue to stay and be very committed to be competitive in the mid-throughput market. And I'm very excited about the future in that market also."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. Throughout the second quarter, I continue to meet with our customers and partners around the world. I've been hearing about all of the opportunities they're excited for and discussing the issues we're facing together in this environment. Most importantly, it has been encouraging to see our customers and partners launch the next generation of their products. Illumina is uniquely positioned to support our customers' aspirations. Ongoing progress in science and technology allows our customers to envision large-scale discovery programs that are now possible using multiomics and customers are more empowered to move whole genome sequencing that provides significantly more insights. Furthermore, there's an opportunity to integrate genomics throughout the health care system to improve patient outcomes but we also have to help our customers navigate their current realities. There are still many moving elements in the global economy and we are taking a more measured view. I'm regularly hearing that our customers feel constrained to make significant capital outlays. We also see it in delays in our sales cycle and in orders being pushed out. For Illumina, this means we balance two important jobs. Job one, is to stabilize our own base. We're doing that through continued rollout of the NovaSeq X Series to lay the groundwork for everything our customers and we want to pursue in the future. We are also highly focused on operational excellence and optimizing the ways in which we run our business. And job two is accelerating growth. Our strategy update next week will address Illumina's vision for the future and our strategy to execute new dimensions of technology from our R&D vault and our financial outlook for the next several years. For purposes of today's call, we'll focus on our second quarter results. In Q2, Illumina again delivered results ahead of expectations, with Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, driven by continued execution against our strategic priorities. The ongoing transition of sequencing activity to the NovaSeq X Plus led to a significant step-up in consumables in the quarter. We also placed another 62 NovaSeq X Plus instruments. With that said, we continue to see our customers actively managing their capital spend. As a result, for the remainder of the year, we are adding caution to our guide. We have taken a more prudent view on the instrument business to reflect the further extension of sales cycles. But at the same time, we have a slightly stronger view on consumables. Ankur will provide further details on our adjusted guidance shortly. Turning to our regions' performance in the second quarter. Americas revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Europe revenue was down 5%, given the significant backlog we worked through early last year following the X launch. AMEA revenue was down 8% and Greater China was down 35%. I've been talking with you about our three key priorities. I'd like to highlight the progress made by Lumina's management team during the second quarter towards those priorities. I'll start with driving our top line which has been focused on expanding our installed base and helping our customers maximize the potential of instruments. As I mentioned earlier, in Q2, we see up 62 NovaSeq X Plus instruments, bringing our total X Plus installed base to 469 instruments. Customers continue to transition their projects on to the NovaSeq X Plus and we are encouraged by the corresponding increase in sequencing activity. NovaSeq X Plus average annual pull-through has topped $1 million per instrument, a milestone achievement. Moving to mid-throughput. In Q2, we introduced the XLEAP-SBS chemistry to our NextSeq 1k/2k, P1, P2 and P3 flow cells, complementing the P4 flow cell we launched earlier this year. The XLEAP launch has exceeded our expectations. More than 60% of the 1k/2k installed base now has upgraded software, a leading indicator for adoption. SBS chemistry delivers improved quality, greater usable reads and lower turnaround times in addition to an attractive pricing. While customers' interest in XLEAP is encouraging, translation to additional instrument uptake has been less than we expected. Our mid-throughput segment remains the most sensitive to the macroeconomic environment. And we have seen our sales cycles continue to lengthen. This is clearly driven by constrained capital spending. Our win rates have remained stable and our pipeline has grown. We will continue to support our mid-throughput customers through this environment and are confident that bringing XLEAP to NextSeq 1k/2k is further strengthening our leadership position around the world. Turning to our second priority, delivering operational excellence. We are thrilled to have Everett Cunningham on board as Chief Commercial Officer. Everett is already driving a sharp customer focus across the business, with an essential underpinning of operational excellence. As I've shared, it has been my goal to align our organization in a way that will make our customers heroes by delivering the products, services and solutions that address their most pressing needs. Following our move to combine our marketing and commercial functions, we've implemented a new commercial organizational design. We are positioning our teams to more effectively serve our customers as their partners for innovation. Teams are equipped with a go-to-market expertise to accelerate our multiomics capabilities and commercialize and scale our software stack across research and clinical customers. This new structure will provide the alignment needed to deliver long-term results for our customers and for the business. Additionally, earlier this year, we shared that we are implementing a portfolio optimization strategy to drive productivity improvements across our supply chain. As one recent example, we have identified a number of products that we will rationalize in an effort to increase our focus on higher profitable offerings. We will, of course, work with our customers to provide a seamless transition to other offerings in our portfolio. We continue to make good progress towards achieving greater operating leverage this year. Moving on to my third priority which has been working to resolve GRAIL as quickly as possible. As you know, in June, we completed the spin-off of GRAIL and GRAIL is now an independent public company. Illumina has maintained a minority 14.5% stake. GRAIL plays a critical role in the fight against cancer. And while it's no longer part of Illumina, we remain confident in its future. We will continue to support GRAIL with our sequencing technology and suite of services. As we're continuing to deliver our process in activating our new strategy, I know we will be well positioned to move forward and lead the next era of genomics growth and discovery. Now, I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our second quarter results and outlook.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thank you, Jacob and hello, everyone. I will be discussing non-GAAP results which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, as well as our consolidated financials that include GRAIL which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. In the last 3 months, I've had a chance to spend time with Illumina teams across all functions. I continue to be impressed with how mission-driven this team is and also how transformation is taking hold at Illumina. I've also heard from several of our investors as part of a listening tour. As I focus my commentary on the financial results and current outlook, I will include some additional color in my remarks. Core Illumina second quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was down 6% year-over-year on both reported and constant currency basis and up 3% from the first quarter of 2024. These results exceeded our guidance. This above-expectations performance was driven primarily by continued increase in high-throughput sequencing consumables revenue as our customers further ramp activity on NovaSeq X Plus. This strength in consumables was partially offset by fewer-than-expected shipments of our mid-throughput instruments, as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions. Total Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $737 million was flat against last year's second quarter which was the highest sequencing consumables revenue quarter of the year 2023. High throughput was a particularly bright spot in this year's second quarter, with consumable shipments growing both year-over-year and sequentially. Ex-consumables revenue grew 35% from the first quarter of 2024, accelerating from the double-digit sequential growth we saw in the first quarter. In order to provide some additional color on transition, as of Q2, approximately 45% of high-throughput giga bases sequenced and a little over 25% of high throughput consumables revenue, was on NovaSeq X Plus. In terms of pace of shifting mix from 6K to X, to date, on average, roughly 5 percentage points of high-throughput sequencing consumables revenue has moved from NovaSeq 6000 to NovaSeq X PLUS each quarter. As this transition progresses, the impact of price continues to reduce. If this trajectory holds, almost half of high throughput sequencing consumables revenue should transition to the NovaSeq X by mid-2025, continuing to reduce the impact of pricing transition and converting volume growth into higher revenue growth thereafter. I hope you find this additional information helpful. We are increasing our disclosures around the NovaSeq X to give you a clearer picture of the progress we are making in this important transition. Moving to sequencing activity. total sequencing Gb output on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew more than 40% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter. Growth in activity from both research and applied and clinical customers was healthy. Although not a predictor of near-term revenue, Gb output provides us a directional view of underlying applications demand and levels of utilization of our instruments and consumables. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $116 million for Q2 grew 5% sequentially but declined 40% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by two factors: one, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant preorder launch-related shipments in the second quarter of 2023; and two, an expected decline in mid-throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $143 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships as well, as higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margins of 69.4% for the quarter increased 240 basis points year-over-year. This strong gross margin performance was driven primarily by a more favorable revenue mix of sequencing consumables and also, importantly, execution of our operational excellence initiatives that improved productivity and delivered cost savings. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were down $15 million year-over-year, reflecting reductions in head count and several other cost containment initiatives. Putting it all together, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2% in Q2 2024 compared to 21.2% in the prior year period. This came in well above our guidance of 18% as well as our expectations due to higher-than-expected revenue, better-than-expected gross margin and strides our organization has made in reducing operating expenses. Below the operating income line, Core Illumina non-GAAP other expense of $13 million in Q2 includes 11 days of interest expense for the $750 million delayed draw term loan we drew in full on June 20, 2024. Core Illumina non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $174 million or $1.09 per diluted share. Core Illumina non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to Core Illumina cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $243 million. CapEx were $30 million and free cash flow was $213 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $994 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. While we were encouraged by our results in Q2, we see several puts and takes as we consider the remainder of the year. On one hand, our customers' capital spending remains constrained. On the other hand, our Consumables business, especially high-throughput, driven by the transition of NovaSeq X, remains solid. We are therefore reducing our revenue expectations, especially for Instruments, for the second half of the year. Core Illumina full year revenue is now projected to be down 2% to 3% from 2023 or down 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Approximately 1/2 of the decline from our prior guidance is due to our lower expectations for our business in China and broader Asia. And the other half is a result of our reduced expectations for mid-throughput and NovaSeq X shipments. From an instruments versus consumables perspective, at the midpoint of the Core Illumina revenue guidance range, sequencing instruments revenue is now projected to decline in the mid-30s rate relative to 2023. Sequencing consumables revenue is now projected to grow towards the upper end of the low single-digit range versus 2023. Now about the remainder of P&L. Illumina has been able to execute on stated operational excellence initiatives, delivering operating leverage above our previous expectations. We thus are raising our Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a range of 20.5% to 21%. This reflects the margin expansion achieved in Q2 2024 but we are also reducing our forecasted operating expenses for the second half of the year. We continue to make progress against our expense actions as well as several operational excellence initiatives under our internal clinical continuous improvement program. We've now launched several new initiatives under this continuous improvement program which we expect will deliver an additional $200 million in expense savings over the next few years. We'll talk about this in more detail at the upcoming strategy update. Additionally, we expect the Core Illumina non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. And lastly, we are introducing guidance for Core Illumina non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 and $3.95 for full year 2024. This range includes second half interest expense resulting from the $750 million delayed draw term loan we put in place in June this year. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion. The decline from the prior year is driven predominantly by lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments given the significant backlog we worked through last year following the launch. For the third quarter, we also expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. The sequential decrease from the second quarter is primarily due to lower revenue and timing of the project spend delayed from Q2. We expect the third quarter non-GAAP Core Illumina tax rate to be approximately 25% and Core Illumina non-GAAP diluted EPS between $0.80 and $0.90 which, again, includes the said interest expense. With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Ankur. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on our latest innovations. For 26 years, Illumina's highest-value asset has been our innovation engine. One example from the quarter is the launch of our latest version of our DRAGEN software which added significant enhancements to our analysis tools. Bioinformatics has become a key driver for customer decisions and this new release includes our most accurate multi-genome mapping technology, advancement in machine learning and the ability to genotype difficult genes to unlock deeper insights. Looking ahead, I'm excited to share the next round of NovaSeq X solutions. As you recall, the NovaSeq X Series we announced in late 2022 includes 2 systems: the NovaSeq X Plus which has been shipping globally since March 2023; and in NovaSeq X, our single-flow cell high through-put sequence for customers looking for a lower-cost entry point to the X Series. The X will begin shipping in Q4 of this year and will be upgradable to the X Plus. Also in Q4, we will introduce 100-cycle and 200-cycle 25B flow cells designed for high-output counting applications such as single cell and proteomics. Additionally, our next software update for the NovaSeq X and X Plus will enable increased yield and other improvements. I'm also pleased with the opportunities Illumina has to further enable the multiomics ecosystem. We will share more next week but one recent highlight was our acquisition of Fluent BioSciences, a company with single-cell technology that source and labels complex cell mixtures to be processed for sequencing. Fluent's approach will make single-cell analysis available to a broader set of customers. Together with the specialized multiomics software solution from our Partek acquisition, Fluent's solution are yet another building block in our efforts to create a greater value for our customers by further integrating their workflows. We want our customers to have the flexibility to adopt the tools that best fit their needs. Illumina will therefore remain an open NGS platform and is committed to maintaining and supporting our existing single-cell partnerships. I'm looking forward to speaking more about our vision, our strategy and our financial outlook next week at our strategy update. This virtual event will be on Tuesday, August 13. Please make sure to register through our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. I'll now invite the operator to open for the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a nice execution here. Maybe, Jacob, a lot of details here in the deck. But if I just look at the guidance and tie that with your Nova X commentary, the pull-through was about $1 million. But I think there was some details about the amount of data being generated on X versus the revenue contribution. Is the delta, sort of the pricing impact, is that how we're supposed to model this transition? So when you think about the guidance change here, I didn't see an orders number for X. How much of this sort of change is coming from high-throughput versus mid-throughput on the instrumentation side?\nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Vijay and I appreciate your comments on the strong quarter also. Yes, so we wanted to provide a little more insights on how to better model how we see it. So we are -- we're certainly very pleased, first and foremost, with the -- we now have reached the milestone of $1 million annual pull-through on the X. And I think the information that you also received from Ankur and Ankur can provide a little more insight here, exactly is to help you guide more on where we are, where we're going and how the pricing versus the volume impact is happening. So, Ankur?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, sure. Vijay, so yes, as you saw, we've added some more disclosures, specifically, to help everyone think through the transition here. Let me just lay it out as I said in the script. So in terms of transition from 6k to NovaSeq X, what we're saying is roughly about 45% of the consumables volume within high-throughput is now on X. So we're nearing roughly about 0.5 point. So in the second half of this year, if the trajectory holds, half of the volume would have moved to NovaSeq X. What I also included was that the pace of that mix is that we're seeing roughly about 5 points of mix shifting from 6k to NovaSeq X every quarter. And if that trajectory holds, by next year, we should also get to about half of revenue coming from NovaSeq X. So that's on the trajectory. To your question around the volume growth, yes, the overall Gb sequenced was about 40%. That is across high-throughput, across mid-throughput. And as you think about high-throughput revenue growth of about 1%, the delta is roughly the pricing and the change of the mix impact there.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question, it comes from Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets.\nConor McNamara: And just a follow-up to that. So if you -- I mean, simple math, if you say volumes were up 40% and sequencing consumables were flat, roughly a 40% headwind on pricing, is that the kind of pricing headwind we should think as the 5% conversion continues? Or was it -- is it higher early on in the NovaSeq X launch? Just trying to figure out what the pricing headwind will be?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, let me address that. So it's higher early on and more of the volume moves to X, the impact of pricing continues to reduce. It's just primarily the way I'm trying to position the data. If you go back and think about holistically, there was a transition from 6k to X would have resulted overall, all-inclusive, easily more than 60% to 70% price decline on a Gb-to-Gb basis. And as the transition continues, our baseline continues to come down, right? So as the mix improves as we get to -- getting into the halfway volume transition point in the back half of this year. And now based on that projection, it could get to halfway revenue transition point by mid next year and the impact of price continues to go down.\nConor McNamara: And just one quick follow-up on pricing. Are you seeing any pricing changes on the equipment side, if you had to give price? Or has that been relatively stable?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Overall, we've seen the -- I think you're referring here to the -- NovaSeq X Plus and where we have seen pretty much stable pricing. And that's also why we're now introducing the NovaSeq X which allows for a lower price point, for customers that are capital constrained but actually wants to get access to the NovaSeq series of instruments -- the NovaSeq X Series of instruments. And what's beauty about that is that it allows them to, later in the period, to upgrade it to the NovaSeq X Plus to get the advantage of the both flow cells. So we expect to see some interest from customers here later this year when we launch the NovaSeq X Plus -- NovaSeq X.\nOperator: And we'll move next to our next question, Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Jacob, maybe one on the $200 million cost savings initiative, I know you want to save some of it for next week, I'm sure. But can you just talk a little bit about, first, the pacing? And then second, where you're seeing opportunities? I know from investor conversations, a lot of people have circled that R&D line. Big question is whether you guys are willing to kind of use that as a lever, again, over 20% here? Can you just talk about, again, if there are any areas that are off limits in terms of the cost reductions? And where you're focusing on for those expense controls? It does feel like there's a lot of opportunity in the P&L. So I'd love just to discuss that a bit.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, let me start by saying that there's certainly no off-limits area. We're looking at all elements in the P&L and the $200 million is a reflection of that also. We are not -- at this point, we're not providing insights on the pacing of this. But what I can tell you is that we are looking at all elements and we'll provide more insight next week. Just referring to the R&D and we continue to take a look at how we want to set up or how the money we're spending in R&D. But just to give you a little bit of my philosophy around R&D is that we are internally looking at each R&D project and valuing them based on tight measures, including NPV and ROIC. And I'm using that also, as you know, I have a background in R&D and thereby, I'm not just driving by an overall number but truly just focusing on the programs that provide an overall growth for the company. But of course, it also drives shareholder value. So we're not building on a tops-down budget and thereby, we are looking at this very, very detailed also. I think, Ankur, maybe you want to say a little bit more about kind of the...\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, sure. Yes, as we said, we'll likely share a little bit more details during the strategy there next week. But what we are laying out here is the steps we are taking towards a multiyear margin expansion strategy. And we'll focus across all areas where we can lead to a structurally better and sustainable cost structure for the company in the long term. So more to come but the focus is across all opportunities across all lines.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: Maybe just cutting the model a different and simpler way as I look at the multi-quarter trend here, it seems like sequencing consumable revenue bottomed out in the fourth quarter at $687 million. It increased to just under $700 million in Q1. We're now up to just under $740 in Q2. While you've guided instruments to be down over 30% year-over-year, it does seem like you're assuming stabilizing instrument revenue in the range of like $110 million to $120 million every quarter this year. So assuming there's no reason to think that there's a magical material change in that as we forward -- fast forward to next year, if Instrument revenue is essentially stabilizing at these levels and Consumables are growing every quarter as the installed base expands and volume use clearly continues to grow, if I'm kind of just simplifying the math, doesn't that imply you have to return to mid-single-digit plus revenue growth next year? Or is there something I'm messing up? I'm not asking you to guide, I'm not asking you to get ahead of yourself for the Analyst Day next week. But just mathematically, what could I be missing here?\nJacob Thaysen: Doug, I think you're right in your assumption is that and what we said earlier on that, we believe that the consumer growth is the right indicator for the turn into a better performance for the company. I still think it's too early to have a detailed conversation about '25. I mean we've seen in the last few days that there's a lot of moving elements. We have a U.S. election coming up. There are still concerns about what is happening in the Middle East. Of course, the interest rates, we will see where that goes. But of course, we are doing everything we can to get back to a much better growth trajectory than we have been on for the past few years.\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. And the only thing I would add, Doug, you're pointing to the right metrics. That's exactly how we're looking at that business as well. And as Jacob said, lots of moving parts here. You've seen the recent prints around the macro. So too early to call on 2025. But the trends we are seeing on the X transition, on the high-throughput consumables, as well as the fact that the impact of pricing should continue to erode or become lower over time are all positive factors, right? This year, what we've also seen is the overall Gb output growth during the first half of the year has been very strong. First quarter was over 35%. We're now seeing over 40%. If you look at last several years' sort of 5-year average, that was more in the 20s to mid-20s range as well. So several moving parts. The fundamentals of the business seem to be moving in the right direction but still too early to call for '25.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel.\nDan Arias: Ankur or Jacob, how is the clinical community moving to adopt the X? And then what kind of expectations should we have for those labs adopting the 25B kit? And if those two things are presumably later than the research community, does that represent an incremental headwind in the back half of the year or '25 if you then have to start thinking about the pricing pressure there? Or do you think that there was a point where elasticity in the clinical markets is actually something you guys are talking about. Do you think that can start to work for you as we head into next year?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I think we continue to see, of course, that the academic environment is -- academia environment has moved faster to the X than where the clinical is and that's very -- there's a good reason for that. As you know, you have to validate your products and your assays on the X before you put it into full production mode. What we have seen, the strategy for many of our clinical customers has been to keep their current validated products or assays on the 6k and then really been focusing on the new assays. And you've seen a few releases actually over the last few weeks on new assays coming out. So you're starting to see that happening. We actually believe this is going to be -- most of our -- and pretty much all our big clinical customers have multiple access already in their laboratories. So we don't -- we're not foreseeing any material change or swings in transition. We think that is going to be quite stable over the next period of time. So I'm not too concerned about certain change in trajectory.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Tycho Peterson from Jefferies.\nTycho Peterson: I want to probe into some of the mid-throughput comments. I know you're talking about capital cash flow when rate's stable. Can you maybe talk a little bit more as to why you don't think that's a competitive issue?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. No, we can certainly do that. And I think we have also -- first of all, I'd say that we -- as I mentioned before, we continue to take competition very seriously. But I also mentioned before that we have had competition. This is not the first competition we're seeing. Illumina had competition all the way through the lifetime of this. That said, we're taking -- I'm taking a very different approach here and proactive stance than from what I saw coming into the company. And we're starting to see that drive meaningful impacts, both in the marketplace and culture in the company. We do see, at least, in the mid-throughput space that with this, the most competitive intensive area that China still is an issue here. There is competitive pressure here but it hasn't really changed over the past quarters. Secondly, we are following each deal very, very closely. And we actually have a very good insight on where we are on this right now. And if you look at it, we actually don't see any change in the win rates. We actually remain quite range-bound over the last few quarters. So we don't see any real change in this. And therefore, we are attributing the biggest part of this to the economic environment.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then a follow-up. If you're expecting 50% of high-throughput Consumables to transition to X by mid-'25. I guess, how much more do you expect to transition and therefore, the price pressure to work its way through the model? And should we expect 2025 to be a year that's below your forthcoming long-range plan?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. Let me just make sure we got the right number there. So from a volume perspective, we should cross the halfway mark here in the second half of '24. As in Q2, we saw the 45% of the volume to come on X. The 2025 references, half of the revenue should transition over into the X. And with every 5, 7-point mix, the impact of the price continues to go down and the contribution of that volume into revenue continues to increase. specifically around, Tycho, 2025, we'll talk about this. There'll be several moving parts. So we'll talk about this when we get to the guidance point.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then just a clarification before I hop off. Is the $200 million continuous improvement program, the extent that the cost outs we'll hear about at the Analyst Day? And is that over 3 years?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, we'll provide more insight next week but we're going to come back and give you a comprehensive view of both our -- how we see the growth, how we expect our application of growth over the next few years. of course, on our margin expansion but also on our earnings power. So we'll provide all that insight next -- over a 3 years' period.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Subhu Nambi with Guggenheim.\nSubhu Nambi: And Ankur, thank you for providing that additional color on NovaSeq X and 6000 dynamics. I had a question -- a follow-up of [indiscernible] which is offshore NovaSeq X placement, what is the mix of clinical versus research? And within clinical customers, what is the mix of new customers versus replacement? Specific to existing customers when they purchase X, are they moving existing assays to X? Or are they typically using the X for new assays, assays that tend to require deeper or virus sequencing? I asked the last part because it does seem like utilization of 6000 is fairly relevant [ph].\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. Subhu, I don't know if we've specifically provided that data mix between clinical and research segmentation. We've generally said it's roughly half and half, I believe, right, Salli, in the past but not something that we're providing on an ongoing basis. Now in terms of our clinical customers transition to X, the general approach is still around newer tests, where most of the clinical customer focus is from an X perspective is to develop newer tests on X at the time of launch and then you see the high volume. And Jacob can add more color there.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, that's absolutely correct. And we're seeing mostly of these new tests being higher intensive of sequencing. So there's, of course, interest of getting more samples but sample is not the only parameter here. We're certainly seeing many of our customers looking for larger panels. It's going to hold genome sequencing, including new insights, for example, [indiscernible] insights in your panels and so on so forth, deeper sequencing in itself. So that's what we see in the clinical space. If you look into the academia space, there's a lot going on, certainly in single cell and in other areas. Now we're starting to see an uptick in spatial which requires much higher intensity of sequencing. So that's what we're seeing right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: So first one is -- just trying to understand the mid throughput -- is there a cost per gigabase a lever that you can use to lower cost in the near term to compete more effectively in that market? Or do you think the Nova X comment that you provided at the end, Jacob instead of the X-plus with the single flow cell think the pricing on that is actually moving lower in order to address maybe a potential gap there with a competitor in the mid-throughput segment?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, I think -- thanks for that. I think both. I mean, meaning that for the NovaSeq X with 1 flow cell, you can run all the applications. You can run 25B flow cell and take full power of the pricing we have for the NovaSeq Plus level of flow cells. But I would say, on the mid throughput, we certainly have an opportunity to use our pricing if we need to. But I do think that -- but that is -- but actually, that actually provides a lot of -- we already priced that to a very, very competitive element. But I do think it's more complicated than that. And while I certainly believe there is a lot of great members of the teams with our competitors, I think sometimes we also get caught up in very too narrow definitions of claims. So sometimes, we see interim workflow steps being just looked at from a claim perspective. We're seeing limited applications, or even performance that is based on very limited data. And I think it pretty much, in all cases, are meeting the full computational chain from DRAGEN, that it also significantly improve the quality and reduce the overall workflow costs. So if you take all that into consideration and even when we provide premium cost per gigabase, you will actually see that for a full cost of workflow, breadth of application and full computation power, we continue to be highly differentiated. And I actually think our customers are seeing that. I agree. We could do a better job in communicating this but we'll spend more time next week also providing more insights on that. But also, more of the differentiations we're going to provide, both to the mid-throughput and high-throughput, by giving you examples of what we have in our R&D vault.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the commercial org, I'm just trying to understand why is now the right time to change? I'm just trying to sort of understand what are some of the changes there? What are -- are you driving some change in the quota-bearing sales force that's out there? Some of that has worked really well historically. You obviously have a really solid product in the marketplace. But just wondering, what's driving that? And what are some of the changes there?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I mean, I think what we announced already was that before Everett come in that I felt it was important to bring our marketing and our sales teams together. So if you start at the top level, when you bring those 2 teams together, you also have some synergistic effect. You will align leadership team and we have done that now on the average. So we have 1 commercial team, so that's number one. Number 2 is that we have taken a deeper look into how do we actually get more quota-carrying people out into the field. And how do we make sure we have even better application capabilities now when we are accelerating ourselves into multiomics and also, where we believe informatics should have an even bigger play. So this is less about changing the regions and the regional structure but more -- adding more feet on the ground, so to say.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then the last one, if I could just ask. How should we think about the overall pull-through? It's already more than $1 million. What's your -- what you're math suggesting where that could land eventually?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I mean, we're certainly very encouraged that we are already now at $1 million annually for the X Series. And while we believe it's going to -- we don't think this is the exit point or the equilibrium. So we believe it can go higher. We also see customers doing much higher right now already. So we're encouraged to see where this could go. But we don't have -- at least we're not ready to share a detailed view on where we think this could go at this point.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\nSung Ji Nam: Just one for Ankur. Could you maybe give us a bit more color in terms of your outlook in China and Greater China and AMEA? I think if you look at the growth trends over the last few quarters, it seems pretty stable. But just kind of curious if your guidance, I think you said that half of that is attributable to China, Asia. And so just kind of curious what your -- how has your expectation changed since the last quarter? And if you expect a significant deterioration in those regions going forward?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So let me start by addressing this here that I think, first of all, related to China, it's still too early to call where we are in the cycle. And from what we can see, the economy is still weak and customer continues to be constrained. So we -- and we don't really -- as you mentioned also, we don't really see any change -- material change in the competitive intensity in China. But it's still a tough market to be in. What I'm really excited about is that we have -- and as mentioned, I think, in the last call also, we hired our new head of Region there in China and she's been in place for a little more than a quarter. And she is very active also in optimizing the commercial structure, as for the rest of the world, really focusing on bringing more into field from the back office. She's also resetting partnerships and optimizing those kind of relationships and of course, continuing to consider how we are targeted in our pricing strategies for specific product groups and finally bringing IVD, more IVD products to China. So there's a lot we are doing there right now. And I think, eventually, this will turn. But at this point, it's too early to provide deeper insights. I think maybe, Ankur you can provide a little more insight on rest of Asia?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, let me give you just a couple more colors, specifically, because we've included that as part of our guidance. The -- our previous estimates and the expectations of China were not for a material recovery in that business. However, if you look at the sequential build of that business, there was an implied increase even though it's still down year-over-year. The business in China over the last several -- over 6 to 8 quarters now has been weak. In fact, if you look at all of Illumina from a year-over-year basis at midpoint, now that midpoint of my full year guidance is roughly 1.5 points lower on a constant currency basis or 2 points on a constant currency basis. A very big part, almost 2/3 of that, is all due to China. And where our business has been quite weak, we're not seeing signs of recovery, lots of commercial action from our perspective, we're making changes in the team. But just the overall environment there right now doesn't look where I would go out and assume any kind of increase in business volumes for the rest of the year. So kind of taken that out of the forecast and trying to derisk that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Eve Burstein from Bernstein Associates.\nEve Burstein: Great. In the last few months, we've seen both Quest and LabCorp announce or expand collaborations with one of your competitors. Can you remind us what portion of your revenue comes from those companies? And then I can imagine some reasons why those companies would act differently than other of your clinical customers. So for example, I'm guessing that they do a higher portion of LDTs and FDA-approved tests, so they don't need as many of the X boxes. Maybe there's a more natural fit. But why shouldn't we take this as a major sign of potential share loss in the clinical market, not just potentially a hit to revenue if and when assays shift to the X and X Plus?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I think I suggest you speak closer to those companies about their decisions on making collaboration agreements with other parties in the NGS space. I think we are focusing on, first and foremost, provide the highest quality to our customers. Because I think there is a little bit over rotation here on a price that goes for a very, very limited application space. And it's not really addressing what you can do for actually the patents you do today or the whole genomes. So on the other hand, I think it's not only about providing a price, also providing a product and a solution where you have confidence in that the vendor can provide and continue to support you. So I think there's many more details that goes into this. And we, here, at Illumina will continue to do our best to provide the best solutions but not only focusing on one single element in the workflow, the cost of sequencing but the whole cost of workflow and providing the highest quality of answers to our customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: So can you talk about some of the pricing transition in XLEAP? I believe that is the -- XLEAP is on the mid-throughput is backwards compatible. I believe you said 60% adoption. How should we think about actual total dollar impact with that pricing transition? Can you talk about this year specifically in that -- in the guidance? And I just have one follow-up. And then just one -- sorry, one further clarification they have on throughput. Can you talk about the validation step required for clinical moving from regular? Two, actually, on that.\nJacob Thaysen: So first on overall, as we mentioned, we had 60% of our installed base has downloaded software. This is for what we see an indicator for that people are very interested in the XLEAP chemistry. But we also see a lot of interest, in particular, the P4. P4 flow cell has been out for a while but also now going into the P1, P2, P3 [ph]. We have a different price point, as we've also been talking about for XLEAP chemistry which is one of the interested -- interesting areas but we also have a higher quality of sequencing and higher capacity. So Ankur, maybe you can provide a little bit more insights on where we are in the transition. But let me just talk to the validation is that, that depends on the going from XLEAP over to -- from the standard SBS chemistry on to XLEAP chemistry. It really depends on the assays. But normally, you will have to go through normal validation. That is just when you shift to other software or [indiscernible] and you'll do that and each clinical lab will know how to do so. But there's no specific steps that is required from our end from going from one to the other. Ankur, do you want to provide more on where we are on the transition?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. In terms of transition, XLEAP to our original -- or the previous consumables, there will be a pricing transition that will happen but it is significantly smaller and likely more proactive relative to what you've seen on the X side. So from a modeling or going forward perspective, the volume of empty consumables as a business is a much, much smaller portion of our P&L and revenue base relative to what our ex-consumables business has. So I'm not -- from an impact on overall revenue line perspective, it will be significantly smaller.\nDavid Westenberg: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on Fluent. What's the intention there in terms of pricing? Can you drive pricing even lower than that? And in terms of pricing in bundles, have you have any thoughts to how you would do bundled pricing? And just on IP, do you feel pretty comfortable with IP? I know that's -- I believe that's an emulsion step versus a microfluidic step. So does that protect you? I mean there's been a lot of IP in that space.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So we are certainly very excited about the Fluent acquisition. And as you also mentioned is that we, first and foremost, believe that the Fluent technology allows for a broader adoption of single cell. So there are some -- there's certainly areas in the mid-throughput where customers can get easily into single cells and patients in high volume where actually the cost of the individual experience here, the individual cell is competitive and can certainly address that market space. We are still too early to go into a discussion about how we're going to commercialize this. But as we mentioned before but we will, of course, go in there and present Fluent, that's a very attractive offering. We will continue to work with all the partners and all the single cell providers in the industry and allow them to have a very, very competitive offering on our platforms also.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question with Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Jacob and Ankur, maybe just a clarification first and then just a question on just consumables. On the clarification, I think you said there's really not much of a margin drag as you move actually into the mid-throughput, is that correct? Because we were under the impression, I think, actually you presented $9 per G and I guess, on-label price for NextSeq might have been something into the teens or low 20s. So maybe you can just speak to a little bit how the margin impact flows through as your mid-throughput base adopts XLEAP?\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. So I'm saying there will be a margin track. What you're looking at is the list prices but the on-market prices are likely different from where the list prices are already and then second, on the margin drag side, given the contribution that mid-throughput consumables make on our overall revenue is relatively a smaller part of my P&L. That drag on full Illumina P&L is going to be generally manageable.\nJacob Thaysen: But I will also say that the R&D team has done a great job together with manufacturing to lower the price of the XLEAP chemistry. So it actually comes with a lower COGS and, thereby, less of a drag on the margins, yes.\nDan Brennan: Got it. And then I know you gave a lot of color during the presentation about volume. But did you speak to -- and I apologize if you did a little bit more on the research first, clinical side, like revenue growth in the quarter? Like how did that break out for NGS? And any color on kind of what's assumed in the '24 guide between like research and clinical and, presumably, whatever competitive impact that is there, even though I guess you see that you're really having success winning? I would presume it's more on the research side than the clinical side. So any color you could provide there would be helpful.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So we're not normally splitting that out but I can tell you that we are growing healthy on both sides of the academic and the clinical part of the business.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.\nSalli Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call and we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor Day and other events.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ankur Dhingra",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacob and hello, everyone. I will be discussing non-GAAP results which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, as well as our consolidated financials that include GRAIL which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. In the last 3 months, I've had a chance to spend time with Illumina teams across all functions. I continue to be impressed with how mission-driven this team is and also how transformation is taking hold at Illumina. I've also heard from several of our investors as part of a listening tour. As I focus my commentary on the financial results and current outlook, I will include some additional color in my remarks. Core Illumina second quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was down 6% year-over-year on both reported and constant currency basis and up 3% from the first quarter of 2024. These results exceeded our guidance. This above-expectations performance was driven primarily by continued increase in high-throughput sequencing consumables revenue as our customers further ramp activity on NovaSeq X Plus. This strength in consumables was partially offset by fewer-than-expected shipments of our mid-throughput instruments, as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions. Total Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $737 million was flat against last year's second quarter which was the highest sequencing consumables revenue quarter of the year 2023. High throughput was a particularly bright spot in this year's second quarter, with consumable shipments growing both year-over-year and sequentially. Ex-consumables revenue grew 35% from the first quarter of 2024, accelerating from the double-digit sequential growth we saw in the first quarter. In order to provide some additional color on transition, as of Q2, approximately 45% of high-throughput giga bases sequenced and a little over 25% of high throughput consumables revenue, was on NovaSeq X Plus. In terms of pace of shifting mix from 6K to X, to date, on average, roughly 5 percentage points of high-throughput sequencing consumables revenue has moved from NovaSeq 6000 to NovaSeq X PLUS each quarter. As this transition progresses, the impact of price continues to reduce. If this trajectory holds, almost half of high throughput sequencing consumables revenue should transition to the NovaSeq X by mid-2025, continuing to reduce the impact of pricing transition and converting volume growth into higher revenue growth thereafter. I hope you find this additional information helpful. We are increasing our disclosures around the NovaSeq X to give you a clearer picture of the progress we are making in this important transition. Moving to sequencing activity. total sequencing Gb output on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew more than 40% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter. Growth in activity from both research and applied and clinical customers was healthy. Although not a predictor of near-term revenue, Gb output provides us a directional view of underlying applications demand and levels of utilization of our instruments and consumables. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $116 million for Q2 grew 5% sequentially but declined 40% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by two factors: one, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant preorder launch-related shipments in the second quarter of 2023; and two, an expected decline in mid-throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $143 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships as well, as higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margins of 69.4% for the quarter increased 240 basis points year-over-year. This strong gross margin performance was driven primarily by a more favorable revenue mix of sequencing consumables and also, importantly, execution of our operational excellence initiatives that improved productivity and delivered cost savings. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $516 million were down $15 million year-over-year, reflecting reductions in head count and several other cost containment initiatives. Putting it all together, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2% in Q2 2024 compared to 21.2% in the prior year period. This came in well above our guidance of 18% as well as our expectations due to higher-than-expected revenue, better-than-expected gross margin and strides our organization has made in reducing operating expenses. Below the operating income line, Core Illumina non-GAAP other expense of $13 million in Q2 includes 11 days of interest expense for the $750 million delayed draw term loan we drew in full on June 20, 2024. Core Illumina non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $174 million or $1.09 per diluted share. Core Illumina non-GAAP tax rate was 24.2% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to Core Illumina cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $243 million. CapEx were $30 million and free cash flow was $213 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $994 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. While we were encouraged by our results in Q2, we see several puts and takes as we consider the remainder of the year. On one hand, our customers' capital spending remains constrained. On the other hand, our Consumables business, especially high-throughput, driven by the transition of NovaSeq X, remains solid. We are therefore reducing our revenue expectations, especially for Instruments, for the second half of the year. Core Illumina full year revenue is now projected to be down 2% to 3% from 2023 or down 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Approximately 1/2 of the decline from our prior guidance is due to our lower expectations for our business in China and broader Asia. And the other half is a result of our reduced expectations for mid-throughput and NovaSeq X shipments. From an instruments versus consumables perspective, at the midpoint of the Core Illumina revenue guidance range, sequencing instruments revenue is now projected to decline in the mid-30s rate relative to 2023. Sequencing consumables revenue is now projected to grow towards the upper end of the low single-digit range versus 2023. Now about the remainder of P&L. Illumina has been able to execute on stated operational excellence initiatives, delivering operating leverage above our previous expectations. We thus are raising our Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a range of 20.5% to 21%. This reflects the margin expansion achieved in Q2 2024 but we are also reducing our forecasted operating expenses for the second half of the year. We continue to make progress against our expense actions as well as several operational excellence initiatives under our internal clinical continuous improvement program. We've now launched several new initiatives under this continuous improvement program which we expect will deliver an additional $200 million in expense savings over the next few years. We'll talk about this in more detail at the upcoming strategy update. Additionally, we expect the Core Illumina non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. And lastly, we are introducing guidance for Core Illumina non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 and $3.95 for full year 2024. This range includes second half interest expense resulting from the $750 million delayed draw term loan we put in place in June this year. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion. The decline from the prior year is driven predominantly by lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments given the significant backlog we worked through last year following the launch. For the third quarter, we also expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. The sequential decrease from the second quarter is primarily due to lower revenue and timing of the project spend delayed from Q2. We expect the third quarter non-GAAP Core Illumina tax rate to be approximately 25% and Core Illumina non-GAAP diluted EPS between $0.80 and $0.90 which, again, includes the said interest expense. With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. Yes, sure. Vijay, so yes, as you saw, we've added some more disclosures, specifically, to help everyone think through the transition here. Let me just lay it out as I said in the script. So in terms of transition from 6k to NovaSeq X, what we're saying is roughly about 45% of the consumables volume within high-throughput is now on X. So we're nearing roughly about 0.5 point. So in the second half of this year, if the trajectory holds, half of the volume would have moved to NovaSeq X. What I also included was that the pace of that mix is that we're seeing roughly about 5 points of mix shifting from 6k to NovaSeq X every quarter. And if that trajectory holds, by next year, we should also get to about half of revenue coming from NovaSeq X. So that's on the trajectory. To your question around the volume growth, yes, the overall Gb sequenced was about 40%. That is across high-throughput, across mid-throughput. And as you think about high-throughput revenue growth of about 1%, the delta is roughly the pricing and the change of the mix impact there. Yes, let me address that. So it's higher early on and more of the volume moves to X, the impact of pricing continues to reduce. It's just primarily the way I'm trying to position the data. If you go back and think about holistically, there was a transition from 6k to X would have resulted overall, all-inclusive, easily more than 60% to 70% price decline on a Gb-to-Gb basis. And as the transition continues, our baseline continues to come down, right? So as the mix improves as we get to -- getting into the halfway volume transition point in the back half of this year. And now based on that projection, it could get to halfway revenue transition point by mid next year and the impact of price continues to go down. Yes, sure. Yes, as we said, we'll likely share a little bit more details during the strategy there next week. But what we are laying out here is the steps we are taking towards a multiyear margin expansion strategy. And we'll focus across all areas where we can lead to a structurally better and sustainable cost structure for the company in the long term. So more to come but the focus is across all opportunities across all lines. Yes. And the only thing I would add, Doug, you're pointing to the right metrics. That's exactly how we're looking at that business as well. And as Jacob said, lots of moving parts here. You've seen the recent prints around the macro. So too early to call on 2025. But the trends we are seeing on the X transition, on the high-throughput consumables, as well as the fact that the impact of pricing should continue to erode or become lower over time are all positive factors, right? This year, what we've also seen is the overall Gb output growth during the first half of the year has been very strong. First quarter was over 35%. We're now seeing over 40%. If you look at last several years' sort of 5-year average, that was more in the 20s to mid-20s range as well. So several moving parts. The fundamentals of the business seem to be moving in the right direction but still too early to call for '25. Yes. Let me just make sure we got the right number there. So from a volume perspective, we should cross the halfway mark here in the second half of '24. As in Q2, we saw the 45% of the volume to come on X. The 2025 references, half of the revenue should transition over into the X. And with every 5, 7-point mix, the impact of the price continues to go down and the contribution of that volume into revenue continues to increase. specifically around, Tycho, 2025, we'll talk about this. There'll be several moving parts. So we'll talk about this when we get to the guidance point. Yes. Subhu, I don't know if we've specifically provided that data mix between clinical and research segmentation. We've generally said it's roughly half and half, I believe, right, Salli, in the past but not something that we're providing on an ongoing basis. Now in terms of our clinical customers transition to X, the general approach is still around newer tests, where most of the clinical customer focus is from an X perspective is to develop newer tests on X at the time of launch and then you see the high volume. And Jacob can add more color there. Yes, let me give you just a couple more colors, specifically, because we've included that as part of our guidance. The -- our previous estimates and the expectations of China were not for a material recovery in that business. However, if you look at the sequential build of that business, there was an implied increase even though it's still down year-over-year. The business in China over the last several -- over 6 to 8 quarters now has been weak. In fact, if you look at all of Illumina from a year-over-year basis at midpoint, now that midpoint of my full year guidance is roughly 1.5 points lower on a constant currency basis or 2 points on a constant currency basis. A very big part, almost 2/3 of that, is all due to China. And where our business has been quite weak, we're not seeing signs of recovery, lots of commercial action from our perspective, we're making changes in the team. But just the overall environment there right now doesn't look where I would go out and assume any kind of increase in business volumes for the rest of the year. So kind of taken that out of the forecast and trying to derisk that. Yes. In terms of transition, XLEAP to our original -- or the previous consumables, there will be a pricing transition that will happen but it is significantly smaller and likely more proactive relative to what you've seen on the X side. So from a modeling or going forward perspective, the volume of empty consumables as a business is a much, much smaller portion of our P&L and revenue base relative to what our ex-consumables business has. So I'm not -- from an impact on overall revenue line perspective, it will be significantly smaller. Yes. So I'm saying there will be a margin track. What you're looking at is the list prices but the on-market prices are likely different from where the list prices are already and then second, on the margin drag side, given the contribution that mid-throughput consumables make on our overall revenue is relatively a smaller part of my P&L. That drag on full Illumina P&L is going to be generally manageable."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. Throughout the second quarter, I continue to meet with our customers and partners around the world. I've been hearing about all of the opportunities they're excited for and discussing the issues we're facing together in this environment. Most importantly, it has been encouraging to see our customers and partners launch the next generation of their products. Illumina is uniquely positioned to support our customers' aspirations. Ongoing progress in science and technology allows our customers to envision large-scale discovery programs that are now possible using multiomics and customers are more empowered to move whole genome sequencing that provides significantly more insights. Furthermore, there's an opportunity to integrate genomics throughout the health care system to improve patient outcomes but we also have to help our customers navigate their current realities. There are still many moving elements in the global economy and we are taking a more measured view. I'm regularly hearing that our customers feel constrained to make significant capital outlays. We also see it in delays in our sales cycle and in orders being pushed out. For Illumina, this means we balance two important jobs. Job one, is to stabilize our own base. We're doing that through continued rollout of the NovaSeq X Series to lay the groundwork for everything our customers and we want to pursue in the future. We are also highly focused on operational excellence and optimizing the ways in which we run our business. And job two is accelerating growth. Our strategy update next week will address Illumina's vision for the future and our strategy to execute new dimensions of technology from our R&D vault and our financial outlook for the next several years. For purposes of today's call, we'll focus on our second quarter results. In Q2, Illumina again delivered results ahead of expectations, with Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, driven by continued execution against our strategic priorities. The ongoing transition of sequencing activity to the NovaSeq X Plus led to a significant step-up in consumables in the quarter. We also placed another 62 NovaSeq X Plus instruments. With that said, we continue to see our customers actively managing their capital spend. As a result, for the remainder of the year, we are adding caution to our guide. We have taken a more prudent view on the instrument business to reflect the further extension of sales cycles. But at the same time, we have a slightly stronger view on consumables. Ankur will provide further details on our adjusted guidance shortly. Turning to our regions' performance in the second quarter. Americas revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Europe revenue was down 5%, given the significant backlog we worked through early last year following the X launch. AMEA revenue was down 8% and Greater China was down 35%. I've been talking with you about our three key priorities. I'd like to highlight the progress made by Lumina's management team during the second quarter towards those priorities. I'll start with driving our top line which has been focused on expanding our installed base and helping our customers maximize the potential of instruments. As I mentioned earlier, in Q2, we see up 62 NovaSeq X Plus instruments, bringing our total X Plus installed base to 469 instruments. Customers continue to transition their projects on to the NovaSeq X Plus and we are encouraged by the corresponding increase in sequencing activity. NovaSeq X Plus average annual pull-through has topped $1 million per instrument, a milestone achievement. Moving to mid-throughput. In Q2, we introduced the XLEAP-SBS chemistry to our NextSeq 1k/2k, P1, P2 and P3 flow cells, complementing the P4 flow cell we launched earlier this year. The XLEAP launch has exceeded our expectations. More than 60% of the 1k/2k installed base now has upgraded software, a leading indicator for adoption. SBS chemistry delivers improved quality, greater usable reads and lower turnaround times in addition to an attractive pricing. While customers' interest in XLEAP is encouraging, translation to additional instrument uptake has been less than we expected. Our mid-throughput segment remains the most sensitive to the macroeconomic environment. And we have seen our sales cycles continue to lengthen. This is clearly driven by constrained capital spending. Our win rates have remained stable and our pipeline has grown. We will continue to support our mid-throughput customers through this environment and are confident that bringing XLEAP to NextSeq 1k/2k is further strengthening our leadership position around the world. Turning to our second priority, delivering operational excellence. We are thrilled to have Everett Cunningham on board as Chief Commercial Officer. Everett is already driving a sharp customer focus across the business, with an essential underpinning of operational excellence. As I've shared, it has been my goal to align our organization in a way that will make our customers heroes by delivering the products, services and solutions that address their most pressing needs. Following our move to combine our marketing and commercial functions, we've implemented a new commercial organizational design. We are positioning our teams to more effectively serve our customers as their partners for innovation. Teams are equipped with a go-to-market expertise to accelerate our multiomics capabilities and commercialize and scale our software stack across research and clinical customers. This new structure will provide the alignment needed to deliver long-term results for our customers and for the business. Additionally, earlier this year, we shared that we are implementing a portfolio optimization strategy to drive productivity improvements across our supply chain. As one recent example, we have identified a number of products that we will rationalize in an effort to increase our focus on higher profitable offerings. We will, of course, work with our customers to provide a seamless transition to other offerings in our portfolio. We continue to make good progress towards achieving greater operating leverage this year. Moving on to my third priority which has been working to resolve GRAIL as quickly as possible. As you know, in June, we completed the spin-off of GRAIL and GRAIL is now an independent public company. Illumina has maintained a minority 14.5% stake. GRAIL plays a critical role in the fight against cancer. And while it's no longer part of Illumina, we remain confident in its future. We will continue to support GRAIL with our sequencing technology and suite of services. As we're continuing to deliver our process in activating our new strategy, I know we will be well positioned to move forward and lead the next era of genomics growth and discovery. Now, I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our second quarter results and outlook. Thanks, Ankur. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on our latest innovations. For 26 years, Illumina's highest-value asset has been our innovation engine. One example from the quarter is the launch of our latest version of our DRAGEN software which added significant enhancements to our analysis tools. Bioinformatics has become a key driver for customer decisions and this new release includes our most accurate multi-genome mapping technology, advancement in machine learning and the ability to genotype difficult genes to unlock deeper insights. Looking ahead, I'm excited to share the next round of NovaSeq X solutions. As you recall, the NovaSeq X Series we announced in late 2022 includes 2 systems: the NovaSeq X Plus which has been shipping globally since March 2023; and in NovaSeq X, our single-flow cell high through-put sequence for customers looking for a lower-cost entry point to the X Series. The X will begin shipping in Q4 of this year and will be upgradable to the X Plus. Also in Q4, we will introduce 100-cycle and 200-cycle 25B flow cells designed for high-output counting applications such as single cell and proteomics. Additionally, our next software update for the NovaSeq X and X Plus will enable increased yield and other improvements. I'm also pleased with the opportunities Illumina has to further enable the multiomics ecosystem. We will share more next week but one recent highlight was our acquisition of Fluent BioSciences, a company with single-cell technology that source and labels complex cell mixtures to be processed for sequencing. Fluent's approach will make single-cell analysis available to a broader set of customers. Together with the specialized multiomics software solution from our Partek acquisition, Fluent's solution are yet another building block in our efforts to create a greater value for our customers by further integrating their workflows. We want our customers to have the flexibility to adopt the tools that best fit their needs. Illumina will therefore remain an open NGS platform and is committed to maintaining and supporting our existing single-cell partnerships. I'm looking forward to speaking more about our vision, our strategy and our financial outlook next week at our strategy update. This virtual event will be on Tuesday, August 13. Please make sure to register through our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. I'll now invite the operator to open for the line for Q&A. Thanks, Vijay and I appreciate your comments on the strong quarter also. Yes, so we wanted to provide a little more insights on how to better model how we see it. So we are -- we're certainly very pleased, first and foremost, with the -- we now have reached the milestone of $1 million annual pull-through on the X. And I think the information that you also received from Ankur and Ankur can provide a little more insight here, exactly is to help you guide more on where we are, where we're going and how the pricing versus the volume impact is happening. So, Ankur? Yes. Overall, we've seen the -- I think you're referring here to the -- NovaSeq X Plus and where we have seen pretty much stable pricing. And that's also why we're now introducing the NovaSeq X which allows for a lower price point, for customers that are capital constrained but actually wants to get access to the NovaSeq series of instruments -- the NovaSeq X Series of instruments. And what's beauty about that is that it allows them to, later in the period, to upgrade it to the NovaSeq X Plus to get the advantage of the both flow cells. So we expect to see some interest from customers here later this year when we launch the NovaSeq X Plus -- NovaSeq X. Yes, let me start by saying that there's certainly no off-limits area. We're looking at all elements in the P&L and the $200 million is a reflection of that also. We are not -- at this point, we're not providing insights on the pacing of this. But what I can tell you is that we are looking at all elements and we'll provide more insight next week. Just referring to the R&D and we continue to take a look at how we want to set up or how the money we're spending in R&D. But just to give you a little bit of my philosophy around R&D is that we are internally looking at each R&D project and valuing them based on tight measures, including NPV and ROIC. And I'm using that also, as you know, I have a background in R&D and thereby, I'm not just driving by an overall number but truly just focusing on the programs that provide an overall growth for the company. But of course, it also drives shareholder value. So we're not building on a tops-down budget and thereby, we are looking at this very, very detailed also. I think, Ankur, maybe you want to say a little bit more about kind of the... Doug, I think you're right in your assumption is that and what we said earlier on that, we believe that the consumer growth is the right indicator for the turn into a better performance for the company. I still think it's too early to have a detailed conversation about '25. I mean we've seen in the last few days that there's a lot of moving elements. We have a U.S. election coming up. There are still concerns about what is happening in the Middle East. Of course, the interest rates, we will see where that goes. But of course, we are doing everything we can to get back to a much better growth trajectory than we have been on for the past few years. Yes. I think we continue to see, of course, that the academic environment is -- academia environment has moved faster to the X than where the clinical is and that's very -- there's a good reason for that. As you know, you have to validate your products and your assays on the X before you put it into full production mode. What we have seen, the strategy for many of our clinical customers has been to keep their current validated products or assays on the 6k and then really been focusing on the new assays. And you've seen a few releases actually over the last few weeks on new assays coming out. So you're starting to see that happening. We actually believe this is going to be -- most of our -- and pretty much all our big clinical customers have multiple access already in their laboratories. So we don't -- we're not foreseeing any material change or swings in transition. We think that is going to be quite stable over the next period of time. So I'm not too concerned about certain change in trajectory. Yes. No, we can certainly do that. And I think we have also -- first of all, I'd say that we -- as I mentioned before, we continue to take competition very seriously. But I also mentioned before that we have had competition. This is not the first competition we're seeing. Illumina had competition all the way through the lifetime of this. That said, we're taking -- I'm taking a very different approach here and proactive stance than from what I saw coming into the company. And we're starting to see that drive meaningful impacts, both in the marketplace and culture in the company. We do see, at least, in the mid-throughput space that with this, the most competitive intensive area that China still is an issue here. There is competitive pressure here but it hasn't really changed over the past quarters. Secondly, we are following each deal very, very closely. And we actually have a very good insight on where we are on this right now. And if you look at it, we actually don't see any change in the win rates. We actually remain quite range-bound over the last few quarters. So we don't see any real change in this. And therefore, we are attributing the biggest part of this to the economic environment. Yes, we'll provide more insight next week but we're going to come back and give you a comprehensive view of both our -- how we see the growth, how we expect our application of growth over the next few years. of course, on our margin expansion but also on our earnings power. So we'll provide all that insight next -- over a 3 years' period. Yes, that's absolutely correct. And we're seeing mostly of these new tests being higher intensive of sequencing. So there's, of course, interest of getting more samples but sample is not the only parameter here. We're certainly seeing many of our customers looking for larger panels. It's going to hold genome sequencing, including new insights, for example, [indiscernible] insights in your panels and so on so forth, deeper sequencing in itself. So that's what we see in the clinical space. If you look into the academia space, there's a lot going on, certainly in single cell and in other areas. Now we're starting to see an uptick in spatial which requires much higher intensity of sequencing. So that's what we're seeing right now. Yes, I think -- thanks for that. I think both. I mean, meaning that for the NovaSeq X with 1 flow cell, you can run all the applications. You can run 25B flow cell and take full power of the pricing we have for the NovaSeq Plus level of flow cells. But I would say, on the mid throughput, we certainly have an opportunity to use our pricing if we need to. But I do think that -- but that is -- but actually, that actually provides a lot of -- we already priced that to a very, very competitive element. But I do think it's more complicated than that. And while I certainly believe there is a lot of great members of the teams with our competitors, I think sometimes we also get caught up in very too narrow definitions of claims. So sometimes, we see interim workflow steps being just looked at from a claim perspective. We're seeing limited applications, or even performance that is based on very limited data. And I think it pretty much, in all cases, are meeting the full computational chain from DRAGEN, that it also significantly improve the quality and reduce the overall workflow costs. So if you take all that into consideration and even when we provide premium cost per gigabase, you will actually see that for a full cost of workflow, breadth of application and full computation power, we continue to be highly differentiated. And I actually think our customers are seeing that. I agree. We could do a better job in communicating this but we'll spend more time next week also providing more insights on that. But also, more of the differentiations we're going to provide, both to the mid-throughput and high-throughput, by giving you examples of what we have in our R&D vault. Yes. I mean, I think what we announced already was that before Everett come in that I felt it was important to bring our marketing and our sales teams together. So if you start at the top level, when you bring those 2 teams together, you also have some synergistic effect. You will align leadership team and we have done that now on the average. So we have 1 commercial team, so that's number one. Number 2 is that we have taken a deeper look into how do we actually get more quota-carrying people out into the field. And how do we make sure we have even better application capabilities now when we are accelerating ourselves into multiomics and also, where we believe informatics should have an even bigger play. So this is less about changing the regions and the regional structure but more -- adding more feet on the ground, so to say. Yes. I mean, we're certainly very encouraged that we are already now at $1 million annually for the X Series. And while we believe it's going to -- we don't think this is the exit point or the equilibrium. So we believe it can go higher. We also see customers doing much higher right now already. So we're encouraged to see where this could go. But we don't have -- at least we're not ready to share a detailed view on where we think this could go at this point. Yes. So let me start by addressing this here that I think, first of all, related to China, it's still too early to call where we are in the cycle. And from what we can see, the economy is still weak and customer continues to be constrained. So we -- and we don't really -- as you mentioned also, we don't really see any change -- material change in the competitive intensity in China. But it's still a tough market to be in. What I'm really excited about is that we have -- and as mentioned, I think, in the last call also, we hired our new head of Region there in China and she's been in place for a little more than a quarter. And she is very active also in optimizing the commercial structure, as for the rest of the world, really focusing on bringing more into field from the back office. She's also resetting partnerships and optimizing those kind of relationships and of course, continuing to consider how we are targeted in our pricing strategies for specific product groups and finally bringing IVD, more IVD products to China. So there's a lot we are doing there right now. And I think, eventually, this will turn. But at this point, it's too early to provide deeper insights. I think maybe, Ankur you can provide a little more insight on rest of Asia? Yes. I think I suggest you speak closer to those companies about their decisions on making collaboration agreements with other parties in the NGS space. I think we are focusing on, first and foremost, provide the highest quality to our customers. Because I think there is a little bit over rotation here on a price that goes for a very, very limited application space. And it's not really addressing what you can do for actually the patents you do today or the whole genomes. So on the other hand, I think it's not only about providing a price, also providing a product and a solution where you have confidence in that the vendor can provide and continue to support you. So I think there's many more details that goes into this. And we, here, at Illumina will continue to do our best to provide the best solutions but not only focusing on one single element in the workflow, the cost of sequencing but the whole cost of workflow and providing the highest quality of answers to our customers. So first on overall, as we mentioned, we had 60% of our installed base has downloaded software. This is for what we see an indicator for that people are very interested in the XLEAP chemistry. But we also see a lot of interest, in particular, the P4. P4 flow cell has been out for a while but also now going into the P1, P2, P3 [ph]. We have a different price point, as we've also been talking about for XLEAP chemistry which is one of the interested -- interesting areas but we also have a higher quality of sequencing and higher capacity. So Ankur, maybe you can provide a little bit more insights on where we are in the transition. But let me just talk to the validation is that, that depends on the going from XLEAP over to -- from the standard SBS chemistry on to XLEAP chemistry. It really depends on the assays. But normally, you will have to go through normal validation. That is just when you shift to other software or [indiscernible] and you'll do that and each clinical lab will know how to do so. But there's no specific steps that is required from our end from going from one to the other. Ankur, do you want to provide more on where we are on the transition? Yes. So we are certainly very excited about the Fluent acquisition. And as you also mentioned is that we, first and foremost, believe that the Fluent technology allows for a broader adoption of single cell. So there are some -- there's certainly areas in the mid-throughput where customers can get easily into single cells and patients in high volume where actually the cost of the individual experience here, the individual cell is competitive and can certainly address that market space. We are still too early to go into a discussion about how we're going to commercialize this. But as we mentioned before but we will, of course, go in there and present Fluent, that's a very attractive offering. We will continue to work with all the partners and all the single cell providers in the industry and allow them to have a very, very competitive offering on our platforms also. But I will also say that the R&D team has done a great job together with manufacturing to lower the price of the XLEAP chemistry. So it actually comes with a lower COGS and, thereby, less of a drag on the margins, yes. Yes. So we're not normally splitting that out but I can tell you that we are growing healthy on both sides of the academic and the clinical part of the business."

Good afternoon, everyone. \n Before going into our first quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank our former Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer, Joydeep Goswami, for his many contributions to Illumina over more than 4 years. As Salli noted, Joydeep will stay on an advisory role through June to support a smooth transition. I also wanted to welcome our new CFO, Ankur Dhingra, who you will hear from shortly, and congratulate Jakob Wedel, who has now been named as Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Jakob joined Illumina in November and has been heavily involved in our long-term strategy planning. \n Throughout the quarter, I continued to meet with customers around the world and have the opportunity to bring a number of them to our San Diego headquarters to discuss new ways to collaborate, innovate and shape what their future looks like with Illumina. Some of our customers shared how they are scaling up their projects with NovaSeq X to unlock greater discovery power. One key area of focus is harnessing whole genome opportunities in minimal residual disease. \n Other customers are starting to sequence deeper and are adding multiomics layers to their projects, while others are looking at epigenomic biomarkers and methylation to help diagnose and characterize disease. We are seeing a significant opportunity to expand in multiomics. Customers are looking for more sophisticated solutions to support their work, and we are exploring all avenues to create value in this space. Our recent acquisition of Partec, a specialized multiomics software solution, is the building block of our expansion into this space. Our intent is to collaborate with our customers to understand how we can provide more sample-to-answer solutions. Illumina is at the heart of the ecosystem, and we will continue to catalyze the industry with an even greater focus on our customers' priorities. \n Turning to our first quarter results. I'll focus my comments on core Illumina. In Q1, we delivered core Illumina revenue of approximately $1.06 billion ahead of our expectations. While it was a decent start to the year, we remain cautious due to the persistently challenging global macro environment where customers are still constrained in their purchasing decisions. As expected, we are seeing this playing out across our regions notably with lower NovaSeq X placements versus the first quarter of 2023, where we shipped our first X instrument to fulfill a strong preorder book. \n 3 of our regions declined year-over-year. Americas revenue was down 4%, EMEA revenue was down 3%, and Greater China revenue was down 14%. Europe revenue was up 7% year-over-year although we expect a decline in Q2 given the last year's strong X shipment in Europe in the second quarter. Nonetheless, Illumina management team continues to make significant progress executing against my 3 key priorities to accelerate value creation across the company. \n My first priority, driving our topline, is grounded in a growing installed base and helping customers realize the full potential of our instruments. In Q1, we shipped an additional 55 NovaSeq X instruments, bringing our total X installed base to more than 400 instruments. This is a solid start of the year, and we expect momentum to continue to build. \n We also saw promising consumables demand throughout the quarter as our customers continue to scaling their operations and expanding their sequencing projects. With the launch of the 25B reagent kit in Q4 and the 1.5B in Q1, and alongside with the well-received upgrade of the 10B flow cell, we are now providing our customers with the full suite of NovaSeq X products. In Q1, we also made XLEAP-SBS chemistry available to our mid-throughput customers with the launch of our P4 flow cell on the existing NextSeq 1000, 2000 instruments. In the first several weeks post launch, we have received exceptional feedback from customers who are reporting reads that exceed specs for quantity and quality. Customers are positive about the simple migration that's enabled them to run spatial and single-cell projects and they are impressed with the accuracy they see with the DRAGEN onboard. \n Illumina continues to pursue strategic partnerships and alliances to drive the entire genomics ecosystem forward. As a recent example, Pillar Biosciences announced FDA approval for its pan-cancer IBD for general tumor profiling on the Illumina MiSeqDx system. We've been partnering with Pillar since 2017 and are excited for this important milestone. Also in the quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb joined our previously announced collaboration with Johnson & Johnson innovative medicine on the development of our multi-cancer whole-genome sequencing-based molecular residual disease assay to better understand disease recurrence. You should expect to see more of these types of activities going forward. \n Now turning to my second priority. I'm continuing my focus on delivering operational excellence by driving margin improvement through increased productivity while sustaining innovation and growth. It has been my goal to align our organization in a way that best supports our customers' evolving needs. In March, we brought together our marketing and commercial teams under one customer first global function. I'm confident that combining these teams into one global commercial organization will build our agility to better serve customers while delivering more sustained growth and margins over time. \n Additionally, we are focused on driving further improvements throughout our end-to-end supply chain and are taking a disciplined approach to improve our cost structure. In Q1, we implemented new initiatives to adjust pricing across our portfolio to better cover our global operational cost. We also made progress in streamlining our real estate footprint as we exited select facilities in the Bay Area and in San Diego. These actions add to the number of ongoing initiatives that will continue to support our margins and increase further flexibility for investment in high-growth areas. \n We are also tightly focused on stabilizing our Greater China business. And in Q1, we brought on Jenny Zheng as Head of region. Jenny has deep expertise in health care and global organization and a strong leadership and execution mindset. He is already proving to be a great leader of our China team and is introducing changes to make our business more in China for China, which will include improving our local manufacturing and partnerships in the region. \n Moving on to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quickly as possible. In April, we reached an important milestone in the divestment process when the European Commission approved our divestment plan for GRAIL. The approved plan contemplates both sales and capital markets options, and we have made progress on both paths, consistent with the European Commission's divestiture. In the event of a capital market transaction, we are required to capitalize GRAIL with approximately $1 billion, reflecting 2.5 years of funding based on GRAIL's long-range plan. The amount includes cash on GRAIL's balance sheet. We are on track to finalize the terms of the transactions by the end of the second quarter. I look forward to having additional updates for you soon. \n Overall, I'm encouraged by the progress we have achieved in the quarter and optimistic about delivering on our initiatives here in 2024. \n Now I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our first quarter results and outlook. \nAnkur Dhingra: Thank you, Jacob, and hello, everyone. \n I'm very excited to join Team Illumina to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. I'm passionate about making a positive meaningful impact in health care. I am very familiar with the rule -- the role Illumina has played in establishing and advancing the genomics industry over the last 25 years. Building on that strong foundation, I'm confident we can continue leading, supporting our customers and delivering on the promise of what genomics can do for patients around the globe. I would also like to express my thanks to Joydeep for his support as I transition into my role. It's been a great first 2.5 weeks. \n I'll start by reviewing our segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL followed by consolidated financial results and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. \n Starting with our segment financials. Core Illumina first quarter revenue was $1.06 billion, which is down 2% year-on-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. This revenue performance exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by 3 areas: first, strong performance in high-throughput consumables; second, timing of revenue from certain strategic partnerships; and third, some customers accelerating delivery of a few NovaSeq X instruments from Q2 into Q1. \n Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $698 million was up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in high throughput. On a sequential basis, NovaSeq X consumables grew in the double digits following the successful launch of the 25B flow cell. Total sequencing GB output on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew over 35% year-over-year and grew at a high single-digit rate quarter-over-quarter. \n Research and applied activity benefited as transition to the NovaSeq X continues to ramp and 25B adoption grew at large core labs. Clinical activity continued to be driven predominantly by the NovaSeq 6000. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. \n Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina of $110 million declined 29% year-over-year in Q1 2024. The year-over-year decline was driven both by one, an expected decline in mid-throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements; and second, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant preorder launch-related shipments in the first quarter of 2023. \n For NovaSeq X, as Jacob noted, we shipped 55 instruments in Q1. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $151 million was up 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and hired instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. \n Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.1% for the quarter increased 190 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by a more favorable mix of sequencing consumables and execution of our operational excellence priorities that delivered cost savings, including freight and improved productivity. This was partially offset by certain strategic partnership revenue that is lower margin and increased warranty and field service costs. \n Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $491 million were down $23 million year-over-year primarily due to decreased labor expense as a result of reduced headcount and continued savings from our cost containment initiatives. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to timing of project spend shifting from Q1 into Q2 and lower stock-based compensation expense due to onetime reversals. Putting it all together, core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 20.6% in Q1 2024 compared to 17.4% in Q1 2023.\n Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $27 million for the quarter grew 35% year-over-year driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $197 million and increased $24 million year-over-year driven primarily by increased headcount to support commercial expansion and research and development. \n Moving to consolidated financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.08 billion was down 1% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $14 million or $0.09 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $185 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations driven primarily by higher core revenue and lower core operating expenses in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 46.4% compared to 27.3% in Q1 2023, with both periods including a meaningful impact from the consolidations of GRAIL's operating loss, which increased by $21 million year-over-year. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 tax rates were in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. \n Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations were $77 million. Capital expenditures were $36 million and free cash flow was $41 million, and we did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. \n Moving now to 2024 guidance. As a reminder, Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL and the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on core Illumina given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment. Our guidance does not assume any impact from the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. We will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2024 upon completion of the divestment. \n We are encouraged by our results in Q1 that came in ahead of our expectations both for topline and margins. We've also seen the seasonal rebuild of our total performance obligations or backlog, which increased more than 20% from the end of Q4. At the same time, we're not -- still not seeing any significant improvement in the macroeconomic environment or our business in China, and we are monitoring the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. While we are seeing early strength in consumables to start the year, it's being offset by capital constraints that are continuing to weigh on instrument purchases. \n As such, we are reiterating our full year 2024 core Illumina revenue guidance of approximately flat from 2023 and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations continue to reflect the benefit of gross margin improvement and disciplined management of our expenses, including reduced headcount, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation as well as the impacts of inflation. \n For the second quarter of 2024, we expect core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.084 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.5 to 7.5 percentage points. The year-over-year decline is predominantly because of the lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments given the significant backlog we worked through early last year following the launch. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects a $22 million sequential increase from Q1 of 2024. \n For the second quarter, we expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%, resulting from a seasonal step-up in operating expenses in Q2 compared to Q1 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses from the timing of equity grants. We also expect an increase due to some project spending shifting into Q2 from Q1. \n With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. \nJacob Thaysen: Thanks, Ankur. \n Before we close and move to Q&A, I would like to comment on our upcoming strategy update event. Illumina's leadership team has been reexamining our strategy, the road map and initiatives for achieving it and the profitable growth we believe it can produce. Our strategy will continue to play to Illumina's strength of building the genomics ecosystem and maintaining a tight customer focus in an increasingly competitive space. \n Central to this is our goal of making customers the heroes in their labs. In every customer meeting, we are listening intently to understand what they need to unleash the full power of their Illumina instruments and making their priorities the core of our strategy. You will see us continue to develop more sample-to-answer solutions to enable the genomics and multiomics ecosystems. We'll maintain our open platform approach and continue to drive the innovation that our customers need to succeed and for which Illumina is known. \n Illumina has long been the standard in NGS. Our strategic hands-on support for customers globally, our deep experience and expertise across multiple research and clinical markets and our decade-long technology road map position us well to continuing leading the industry and enabling our customers to improve human health. I am excited to announce that we will be sharing our comprehensive strategy work with you during a virtual event in the fall of this year. We will have more information in the coming months. Thank you for joining. \n I'll now invite Ankur and Joydeep to join me for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. \nDouglas Schenkel: Jacob, I want to start with a high level on that kind of builds off of the announcement you just made and then I want to ask a specific cleanup question on the quarter. So first, it's hard to believe, but we're now just over, I think it's 8 months into your tenure as CEO of the company. From the outside, we see the changes you are starting to make to leadership, to the broader organization and in moving towards a resolution on GRAIL. \n That said, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about things like, first, I'd say, your view on Illumina's long-term growth profile especially given uncertainty about the competitive landscape and the outlook for market elasticity? Secondly, what are reasonable operational targets? And then thirdly, ultimately, whether the company as we sit here today, is positioned to play offense. Would you be willing to share at least a little bit more today about where you are in the process of moving from data gathering and business assessment to maybe putting some stakes in the ground regarding the medium and long-term outlook for the company from a growth and operating margin standpoint? \n And I know that was a lot, but let me sneak in the mathematical follow-up question on the quarter. It seems like high throughput sequencing consumable revenue grew low to mid-teens. Is that right? And if so, what does that tell you about evolving competitive dynamics and questions regarding elasticity? \nJacob Thaysen: Well, Doug, thank you very much. That was a long question, and I think also a happy birthday to you. So I'll do my best here to answer the first question. And I think actually, I'm just a little bit over 7 months into my tenure. So maybe I should have another month before we really ask this question. But definitely, I'm spending -- I continue to spend a lot of time with our customers, with our employees. I'm excited every time I go and walk over in the R&D building and uncover new innovations that we are doing. There's a lot going on in this company. \n In the meantime, we are also spending a lot of energy on looking into, of course, where -- how are we -- in what direction are we putting Illumina going forward. And I think we covered a little bit that in my prepared remarks is that we see a lot of opportunities in both in genomics, but now with the X coming out there, and we see a lot of elasticity in that area already with many customers are using that to go into single cell into spatial and doing bigger and bigger program and deeper and deeper analysis. \n This is not something that is in the future. It's already happening now. But obviously, at the same time, we running through that change in price point. And of course, we expect to see elasticity to really help us here over the next period of time. So while I'm not ready to share with you where we would go from an overall growth perspective, long range, I can guarantee you that we still are optimistic about the growth of Illumina going forward. \n Secondly, as I think you saw here in Q1, we are highly dedicated to continue to expand our margins. And I'm really pleased with what all the work we're into with the team here and how we saw the gross margin expansion here for the quarter. So I think that's just an evidence on what we are committed to do to continue to drive up. And I don't think there's anything that holds us back to drive up margins over the next period of time to where we have been at historic levels. \n But then again, I do want to wait a little more to have everything lined up from a strategic point of view and thereby also our growth algorithm and our cost structure algorithm to really go out and share the details. But fundamentally, I truly believe that Illumina has a great opportunity of being and continuing to what we have done in the last decade of leading the genomics industry, being in the middle of the ecosystem, really go out there and support our customers. \n But now in the future, where the customer expectations are different from what they have been in the past to really focus on end-to-end workflows, but also new innovations into the multiomic space that we're highly committed to. \n So that was where I'm right now. I think then maybe yes, on -- Joydeep can help us a little bit on the consumable question. \nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. Look, I think and happy birthday again, Doug. On consumables, we, as expected, saw strong growth with X consumables, and we saw X consumable revenues offset our growth in X consumables revenues offset the decline in -- the expected decline in 6K consumers, right? So that's a good piece. We also are seeing very strong sequencing activity growth driven by X and X customers, right? So this is a really positive thing, and it underpins a lot of what Jacob talked about in terms of new applications or expanded applications in clinical and in research, right? So we're excited about that, and we expect that to continue as the 25B flow cell gets more adopted and more used in regular activities at our customers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. \nPuneet Souda: Let me focus a bit on the mid-throughput segment. I just want to understand, can you provide us what was the growth in that mid-throughput segment for both consumables and more importantly, instrumentation. There's -- there are increasingly more questions as customers and the core labs that don't necessarily have an X or a 6K are taking on a competitor system because it's lower price -- I mean lower cost per gigabase almost half of what XLEAP is an the NextSeq. So just wondering, can you elaborate a bit more on what's happening in that segment? And how do you address that? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for that, Puneet. I think as a starting point, we are not providing details on the growth on mid-throughput segment. But let me just try to address some of your questions anyway, is that we, of course, are very committed to the mid throughput, and I'm really excited with the X's chemistry now coming out on the 1K, 2K. It's only been a few weeks out there, but we have seen, as I mentioned also before, tremendous excitement from our customers that this doesn't need a new instrument, you can pretty much with a software upgrade, you can add -- you can use the new flow cells that you can get higher quality scores, you can get more capacity and you can also, of course, with a low price point. \n So a lot of our customers are super excited about that, and it really makes us highly competitive in that space. That said, you're right, there's competition. And by the way, we take competition very seriously in our whole segments, but mid-throughput is clearly where there's more activity -- competitive activities than maybe other spaces. We are seeing that mostly in China still. But in rest of world, there is also that. But we will continue to innovate in this space. I think the XLEAP as I mentioned, was a good step in that direction. But it's an area we will continue to compete in. And also, we expect to fight for every market share points out there. \nJoydeep Goswami: Maybe to add, right, so 2 things. We continue to see consumables growth. So elasticity in that mid-throughput segment. So that's one. And two, we had, as we had told you when we said our budget for the year. We had already anticipated a certain level of competition and what we are seeing in the market is in line with what we had expected. And again, I want to emphasize that some of the forecast that we have given from that throughput accounted for the macroeconomic headwinds that we had expected to see going through this year, and we -- actually, those have come to bear, right? So Again, it's in line with what we had told you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Ankur, welcome. I guess my first question is -- my first question is on the guidance here. And Jacob, maybe you can chime in on this, right? So sequentially, core revenues are up by about $30 million-ish. Is that all being driven by consumables. I think you mentioned you saw improving consumable pull-through on the X throughout the quarter as the quarter progressed. So maybe some color on what the exit rate is and where is that increase coming from? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I think Ankur can certainly also chime in here, but we saw actually strength throughout the quarter. There was nothing of this being the last few weeks of the quarter. But we continue to see customers adopt the X consumables now where we have a full portfolio about the 25B, the 10B and the 1.5B. We see a lot of more applications coming onboard from our customers. So it has really been truly by the X as Joydeep also was talking about before that we have seen improvement. \n Besides that, we have also -- so the beat was very nice on the consumables. But we've also seen our BD revenue growth. We have seen some partnerships that has been accelerated. And we're just excited about that because it's a big part of our strategy also to continue to develop together with our partners. So that was also part of our performance. \n Ankur, you have more comments? \nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. I think thanks that was well covered. The only thing I would add specifically that the sequential increase in business that we are forecasting and building the guidance comes both from instruments and consumables. So expecting both of that positive trend to continue here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. \nDaniel Brennan: Ankur, welcome aboard. Maybe just a question on multiomics and some of the new products that, Jacob, you've been talking about, and it's been kind of in the Illumina proxy as well. Can you just give us some color maybe start with maybe the SomaLogic kind of partnerships? Is that the multiomic excitement that you're expressing. And then any other color you could provide about like sample-to-answer and some of the newer areas that you're looking to explore timing-wise, when do you think we'll get an update on that? Will it be on Investor Day? Or just how do we think about potential opportunity for Illumina? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes, for sure. Thanks, Dan. And you're absolutely right. I mean, overall, I'm excited about the way that sequences can play in multiomics. And I'm excited about what -- how we can help also partners and customers stimulate that market. And that goes for all the multiomic spaces, if you look into them. But of course, we are -- if you just look short term here, we're, of course, very excited about our relationship with SomaLogic and where we can go with the proteomics. We are still in early access.\n So '24 will be the year where we are going out with a few handfuls of customers and really going in and make sure we truly understand the power but already the feedback from customers so far has been very positive on that. So I'm certainly excited about that. But we will continue to look into options for us to play even stronger into multiomics going forward across all the opportunities there, both organically, but of course, also together with our partners out there. \n If you look into end-to-end workflows, I think that's really a great opportunity, as I mentioned also before, that I see customers obviously, are looking for the best technology, but they're also looking for ease of use. That is not only about the sequence itself, but sample-to-answer. And the more we can automate, the more we can simplify both from, of course, sample prep, but of course, also from informatics, I think we can really make sure that our customers can spend the time on where they can create most value. So we'll speak more about that, as you mentioned also in our strategy update. And I think Illumina has a great opportunity to cover whole workflows and create great applications for our customers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Arias with Stifel. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Paul on for Dan. I think just one from us. In terms of POPSEQ, could we get some commentary on that? It seems like all of us has seen some budget pressure. There's been some news flow there with recent cuts. Does that create any risk to the consumables forecast for the year? And maybe on the flip side, in Europe with genome of Europe, there's been some chatter about that picking up? Is that something you could see increased activity in 2025 that would be meaningful? \nJacob Thaysen: I think overall, we have -- if you look at the longer run, we are -- long horizon or midterm horizon. I'm very excited about the PopGen -- not only for PopGen but what it really constitute in terms of [indiscernible] really looking into big genomic studies to -- in the end to implement into the health care system. And we have more than 30 programs ongoing right now, and we have at least the same number in the funnel for opportunities for the future. But we're not banking on any one individual program. \n So it's clear with these big programs, where you have sovereigns have to make the systems and budgets and so on that there's a little bit puts and takes in that. And thereby, we are not really budgeting and building our budgets based on individual programs. So I don't foresee that any of them are making a big impact on our either '24, '25 opportunity. But obviously, we are doing our best to stimulate the market out there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. \nDavid Westenberg: So I just want to start with the continuation of Puneet's question on the mid-throughput side. How has XLEAP helped maybe in that mid-throughput -- or how do you anticipate it helping it. And Joydeep, I think you mentioned some -- there is some elasticity there. I think there, it's a little bit less clear in the X department, you definitely see the whole genome from , you see a lot more single cell kind of stuff. Can you just reiterate some of that elasticity and how to prevent that from being a race to the bottom, just given that the -- as you mentioned, the competitor is using price there? \n And then on the high throughput side, you did say that you expect the order rate momentum to build. Is that based on actual orders in the book? Is it and very late in the cycle orders or it's just anticipation of budgets? I mean, any way you can walk us through how -- make us a little more clear on that? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. No, thanks. Let me try to give a little more color on the mid-throughput is that we're actually seeing with -- XLEAP's chemistry is -- as I said, there's really 3 dimension to it is high quality of sequencing, but it's also higher capacity with a lower cost. So it really gives customers an opportunity to do more with the sequences. And thereby, we also see that there are customers that were looking to maybe go into single cell or even spatial that they felt they couldn't afford or they couldn't do on -- with the capacities or with the cost positioning that was previously that now opens up for that space. \n So I think we are seeing again an elasticity game that will play out over the next period of time. I think in the end, customers are really looking to work with innovators here in the field. And they -- I think XLEAP chemistry is just another example that we continue to innovate in all our segments. And so while it is an environment right now that's also been impacted by the macro, I actually am pretty excited about what the XLEAP chemistry will do for us over the next period of time and what new applications it will bring on also in the mid throughput. As you mentioned, there are a lot of things going on in high throughput also but we see some of the same things happening in mid throughput. \nJoydeep Goswami: Yes. I think I think just to comment on and add to what Jacob has said, right? XLEAP, remember, was a way for us to help our customers use the same instruments that are already out in the field and with a simple software change, right, they basically can get increased output, better accuracy, better performance. And I think we saw that come through very clearly with our launch in Q1. I want to emphasize too, right? You're seeing the elasticity and really immediately in the research domain, right, where a lot of what Jacob was talking about in terms of multiomics, single cell, spatial things do tend to get performed first on the research side on mid-throughput. \n We are also continuing to see that we can maintain, because of our innovation and our technical superiority, a price premium over what others are offering in the market, right? So we're seeing a lot of that continue, and we are encouraged by that. The macroeconomic pieces are there, but they will end at some point, and we do expect that at that point, some of the cash constraints that our customers are facing will lift. \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. And then I think you had the question about how orders on the X. And I would say, first of all, the -- we've seen the X orders being up year-over-year. So we're certainly encouraged by that. And as you know also know that we actually expect that we will have improvements during the -- momentum during the year. So at this point, we are just expecting this to look better. And especially since we have a lot of customers that bought one or maybe 2 Xs have done validation work on that. And we are starting to see these multiple orders coming in now up to 10 instruments at a time. So I think you will see that momentum go through the year also. \nJoydeep Goswami: But Dave, this is not based on some magic new budget thing, right? We as -- just to reiterate, we have expected to see the macroeconomic conditions continue as they are right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Subbu Nambi with Guggenheim. \nSubhalaxmi Nambi: You reiterated guidance for the core sequencing revenue growth this year. And I apologize if I missed it, but do you still expect the mix of consumables and instruments to be the same? Or is the expected trajectory now or a bit different? \nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. Great question. This is Ankur. So you're right. We reiterated our guidance for the full year, both for revenue as well as for the operating margin. Actually, we're off to a great start for the year as well with the Q1 performance, certainly looking at that derisking the performance a little bit. Now overall, we'll be confirming our guidance. So the construct is still there. The -- and you've seen the Q1 performance. \n Just to add a little bit more color there, if you think from a half 1, half 2 perspective, et cetera, our instrument growth rates given how the shipments of X were last year, those growth rates have a variability during the year between half and in half 2, although consumables as they're starting now should have a more steady kind of profile. \n Now we saw good pricing. We've seen good pull-through during the quarter as well. So as of now, we're just reiterating the overall guidance for the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank. \nSung Ji Nam: And also welcome to Ankur and congrats, and thank you to Joydeep. Just a quick one on the status of the jurisdictional appeal in Europe and whether the resolution of that -- the timing of that, if it doesn't happen before the end of 2Q, would you still be providing your final terms of the divestiture? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. So thanks for that. And overall, as you know, we are moving forward with GRAIL as fast as we can, and we have committed to provide of course, insight here by end of Q2. And I would say at this point, there's nothing, no information, nothing that holds us back from that. So -- we don't know when the ECJ information is coming. And as I said, we're not waiting for it. If it comes before Q2, it really doesn't change the timeline, end of Q2. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. \nTejas Savant: Just a few cleanups on the high-throughput side things, Jacob, if I may. So on the 25B flow cell, it sounds like you're getting really good traction there. Can you give us an update on that 40% number you provided in the past and X customers who adopted 25B? Where is that number today? \n Second, any update on where high clinical customers are in their X validation process? Any metrics you could share? Or should we think of the production workflows and clinical ramping is mainly a 2025 dynamic? \n And then last one, just on excess high throughput capacity. That's a dynamic that comes up every once in a while. Is that starting to weigh on customer purchase decisions for these high throughput customers at all? You've got Ultima launching as well here. So just curious as to the macro headwinds versus the digestion of that high throughput capacity that's been added given the NovaSeq X and the 25B launch but also the competition? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Overall, I think we're very pleased with seeing where the X and also the 25B consumers where it's going. And right now, we are -- approximately half of our customers have -- are using the 25B flow cell. So that's really exciting for us, and we are encouraged by that momentum. \n I think many of our clinical customers, I know they're still on running most of their of their assays on the 6K. We are tracking very closely each of them and seeing where they are and where they're doing from validation and when they're going into production. \n So we have deeper that insight. I don't think we at this point, we are ready to share that. But we have a very good understanding on that. But I still think there is -- that is -- a lot of them are still working through the validation and then they will bring on one by one of new types of assays that likely have higher, deeper depth or more insights for -- in these assets that they had on the 6K. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mason Carrico with Stephens. \nMason Carrico: Sorry if these have been addressed as I joined a bit late here. Could you update us on win rates outside of China last quarter? I think you said they had stabilized in Q3 and Q4. Have you seen that stability continue throughout 2024 so far? And then second, could you give us any insight into the mix of orders coming -- that are coming in terms of 6K upgrades, fleet expansions, new customers, new to high-throughput customers? \nJacob Thaysen: So I think overall, we are, of course we are following very closely, of course, where we are on the win rate. And as we also mentioned, it's stabilized, and we are looking at that regularly and ensuring that we continue to hone in on how we can do even better. So I'm actually pleased with the performance out there. But obviously, we're keeping a very close sight on this. \n As I mentioned before, we take competition very seriously. We are doing everything we can to keep our customers being very highly supported and make sure that they are successful in laboratories, which I think in the end, in the long run is the winning formula for being the preferred partner for our customers. \n And I think on mix of orders. I don't know whether we normally are sharing that information. But I think there are -- at this point, there's certainly still more research customers that have moved on to the X. And we have seen customers with multiple 6Ks that are now starting to move over to the expert. I would say the vast majority still are in the transition phase. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. \nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: So I want to question a little bit on the instrument placement number for the X this quarter. You mentioned 55 placements, but you also highlighted that there were a number of places that were pulled forward from 2Q into 1Q. So first, can you just quantify how many placements were pulled forward? And then just in terms of full year dynamics, you continue to highlight that the macro backdrop remains difficult. We've seen that really across the sector this quarter. But can you just give us in light of that assumption, what are your latest assumptions on placements for the year? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I'd say, overall, as we mentioned that we're -- we didn't pull anything forward. We were -- there was customers that was requesting to put forward because some of their programs were running faster than anticipated. But there's only a few so it was not really a big change in expectations. But in the end I like that because it shows that there are a lot of interest out there and customer that has already purchased one is looking to accelerate now their transition into the X. So we are -- so I'm excited about that. \n At this point, we're not providing a number, but we know that as we entered into 2023, we had a very, very strong backlog, of course, as you know, coming into 2023. So -- and thereby, 2023 was a very strong placement year of high throughput. So we do expect to be lower than that as we also communicated in our original guidance. But we haven't -- we are not able to provide -- or we're not -- at this point, we're not changing really our expectation for the year. \nAnkur Dhingra: The only thing I would add, Richard, for you, just in terms of our topline performance was quite better than what we were expecting. Relative to that overall achievement or overachievement only a small portion, say, about 1/4 or so came from these customers who asked to for an earlier delivery of the instrument. So relatively small portion from that phenomenon. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly: Can you just talk through the margins? 2Q, obviously, a little bit of a step down. I know you guys mentioned maybe some product cost there. But can you just give a little more color in terms of what spend picks up in 2Q and then how we should think about that metric as we work our way through the year. \n And then just a quick cleanup, just on the service revs, those came quite a bit higher than we were expecting. If you could just flesh out what happened there as well, that would be helpful. \nAnkur Dhingra: Yes, sure. Good question. So let me address them both. This is Ankur. So on the OpEx, as I said in my prepared remarks, yes, there is a step-up in spending from Q1 to Q2, primarily coming from 2 factors. One of them relates to just the timing of our merit increases in the annual stock branch cycle. So we end up getting the full impact of that cost in Q2. So that's seasonal, typically happens every year for the company. So roughly about half of our sequential increase in the OpEx comes from that. \n The other half is generally around certain project-related spend, that we've pushed out either pushed out into Q2, or there are milestones into Q2 that will happen. In terms of going forward, as you think about your P&L for the rest of the year, I do expect the overall operating margin performance to continue to improve sequentially every quarter. So Q3 better than Q2 and then Q4 better than Q3. \nJoydeep Goswami: And then on the service? \nAnkur Dhingra: And then on the services side, again, very strong overall growth, about 27% year-over-year growth, 2 main components. One part of that is little less than half is coming from specific pharma customer services, which had the timing of that in the quarter. So that was less than half of it, but roughly half of that growth is coming from just the excellent performance in our core instrument services business. \nJoydeep Goswami: You would expect that given the number of instruments we placed. And just to add to Ankur's comments, right? We are expecting and delivered better gross margin performance, right? So that should help our operating margin. We expect to continue strong performance on gross margins. So that should help us and as revenue steps up as well. And given that we have taken measures to control our costs, we've reduced our headcount overall by about 12% compared to last year. That should also add benefits to the operating margin line as we go through the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research. \nEve Burstein: Earlier this week, the FDA published a final rule exercising regulatory power over a lab developed tests. For you guys, you have the benefit of having IVD compliant machines when a lot of the companies that are emerging to challenge you don't have those yet. However, our understanding is that research use only machines are actually used quite a bit for FDA-approved tests. It's a little bit harder, but it can be done. So we don't expect this to affect you that much or give you a big competitive advantage. Is that the right way to think about it? Or could there be more upside from the role for you? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. No, first of all, I think we are pleased for sure that we have now more of greater clarity on the FDA ruling and the direction of this. But there's still a lot of detail that needs to be clarified. But overall, you're right that with our positioning, both with our DX portfolio and the investment we have made into the high-quality and also helping with required documentation for our customers to go in there and get their PMAs approved. I think we're very well positioned. \n You mentioned that LDTs are used for FDA approval. Well, really only if you go into a single site PMA setup. And that requires actually a lot of work for vendors like Illumina to help our customers with that with the right level of documentation and so on. So I think it actually plays to our strength going forward, and we are committed to support this area and help our customers be successful independent on whether it's a full PMA single site or other types of opportunities that this new world will bring us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets. \nConor Noel McNamara: I know you talked about not giving too much detail on the consumable adoption with X customers. But is there any -- can you quantify at all like of the 400-or-so boxes placed, how many of those customers are just would you say are at scale and ordering at what your demand is versus those that are still validating or whether for economic conditions haven't really ordered what you expect from them? And vice versa, has there been any stock orders with any of the X customers? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes, that's a good question. And at this point, we still see that most of our customers are still in the ramp. I think there are, of course, research customers that have us very fast out and really run bigger programs. We have seen the [indiscernible], we have seen single cell being some elements or areas where there's been a lot of interest in running. And I think that we have seen some of those research customers already been on scale at least with one of the instruments they have bought and now maybe they're starting to move on to the next one. \n But then again, if you look at the broader 400, I think most of the general is still that this is still in a ramp positioning. Now -- yes, so that's where we are right now. \nJoydeep Goswami: And the stocking? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes, yes, go ahead, Joydeep. \nJoydeep Goswami: I mean, on the stocking side, look, when we haven't seen too much stocking on the 25B because as a standard, right, the initial shelf life is shorter, so you wouldn't expect people to stock up too much. On the 10B side, it's very early in that stock up phase. Again, we expect to see a little bit more as we go through the year, but not yet. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz. \nSallilyn Schwartz: Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available in the Investors section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and other events. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ankur Dhingra",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacob, and hello, everyone. \n I'm very excited to join Team Illumina to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. I'm passionate about making a positive meaningful impact in health care. I am very familiar with the rule -- the role Illumina has played in establishing and advancing the genomics industry over the last 25 years. Building on that strong foundation, I'm confident we can continue leading, supporting our customers and delivering on the promise of what genomics can do for patients around the globe. I would also like to express my thanks to Joydeep for his support as I transition into my role. It's been a great first 2.5 weeks. \n I'll start by reviewing our segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL followed by consolidated financial results and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. \n Starting with our segment financials. Core Illumina first quarter revenue was $1.06 billion, which is down 2% year-on-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. This revenue performance exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by 3 areas: first, strong performance in high-throughput consumables; second, timing of revenue from certain strategic partnerships; and third, some customers accelerating delivery of a few NovaSeq X instruments from Q2 into Q1. \n Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $698 million was up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in high throughput. On a sequential basis, NovaSeq X consumables grew in the double digits following the successful launch of the 25B flow cell. Total sequencing GB output on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew over 35% year-over-year and grew at a high single-digit rate quarter-over-quarter. \n Research and applied activity benefited as transition to the NovaSeq X continues to ramp and 25B adoption grew at large core labs. Clinical activity continued to be driven predominantly by the NovaSeq 6000. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. \n Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina of $110 million declined 29% year-over-year in Q1 2024. The year-over-year decline was driven both by one, an expected decline in mid-throughput shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements; and second, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant preorder launch-related shipments in the first quarter of 2023. \n For NovaSeq X, as Jacob noted, we shipped 55 instruments in Q1. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $151 million was up 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and hired instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. \n Moving to the rest of the core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.1% for the quarter increased 190 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by a more favorable mix of sequencing consumables and execution of our operational excellence priorities that delivered cost savings, including freight and improved productivity. This was partially offset by certain strategic partnership revenue that is lower margin and increased warranty and field service costs. \n Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $491 million were down $23 million year-over-year primarily due to decreased labor expense as a result of reduced headcount and continued savings from our cost containment initiatives. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to timing of project spend shifting from Q1 into Q2 and lower stock-based compensation expense due to onetime reversals. Putting it all together, core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 20.6% in Q1 2024 compared to 17.4% in Q1 2023.\n Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $27 million for the quarter grew 35% year-over-year driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $197 million and increased $24 million year-over-year driven primarily by increased headcount to support commercial expansion and research and development. \n Moving to consolidated financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.08 billion was down 1% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $14 million or $0.09 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $185 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations driven primarily by higher core revenue and lower core operating expenses in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 46.4% compared to 27.3% in Q1 2023, with both periods including a meaningful impact from the consolidations of GRAIL's operating loss, which increased by $21 million year-over-year. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 tax rates were in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. \n Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations were $77 million. Capital expenditures were $36 million and free cash flow was $41 million, and we did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. \n Moving now to 2024 guidance. As a reminder, Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL and the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on core Illumina given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment. Our guidance does not assume any impact from the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. We will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2024 upon completion of the divestment. \n We are encouraged by our results in Q1 that came in ahead of our expectations both for topline and margins. We've also seen the seasonal rebuild of our total performance obligations or backlog, which increased more than 20% from the end of Q4. At the same time, we're not -- still not seeing any significant improvement in the macroeconomic environment or our business in China, and we are monitoring the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. While we are seeing early strength in consumables to start the year, it's being offset by capital constraints that are continuing to weigh on instrument purchases. \n As such, we are reiterating our full year 2024 core Illumina revenue guidance of approximately flat from 2023 and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations continue to reflect the benefit of gross margin improvement and disciplined management of our expenses, including reduced headcount, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation as well as the impacts of inflation. \n For the second quarter of 2024, we expect core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.084 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.5 to 7.5 percentage points. The year-over-year decline is predominantly because of the lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments given the significant backlog we worked through early last year following the launch. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects a $22 million sequential increase from Q1 of 2024. \n For the second quarter, we expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%, resulting from a seasonal step-up in operating expenses in Q2 compared to Q1 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses from the timing of equity grants. We also expect an increase due to some project spending shifting into Q2 from Q1. \n With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you. Yes. I think thanks that was well covered. The only thing I would add specifically that the sequential increase in business that we are forecasting and building the guidance comes both from instruments and consumables. So expecting both of that positive trend to continue here. Yes. Great question. This is Ankur. So you're right. We reiterated our guidance for the full year, both for revenue as well as for the operating margin. Actually, we're off to a great start for the year as well with the Q1 performance, certainly looking at that derisking the performance a little bit. Now overall, we'll be confirming our guidance. So the construct is still there. The -- and you've seen the Q1 performance. \n Just to add a little bit more color there, if you think from a half 1, half 2 perspective, et cetera, our instrument growth rates given how the shipments of X were last year, those growth rates have a variability during the year between half and in half 2, although consumables as they're starting now should have a more steady kind of profile. \n Now we saw good pricing. We've seen good pull-through during the quarter as well. So as of now, we're just reiterating the overall guidance for the year. The only thing I would add, Richard, for you, just in terms of our topline performance was quite better than what we were expecting. Relative to that overall achievement or overachievement only a small portion, say, about 1/4 or so came from these customers who asked to for an earlier delivery of the instrument. So relatively small portion from that phenomenon. Yes, sure. Good question. So let me address them both. This is Ankur. So on the OpEx, as I said in my prepared remarks, yes, there is a step-up in spending from Q1 to Q2, primarily coming from 2 factors. One of them relates to just the timing of our merit increases in the annual stock branch cycle. So we end up getting the full impact of that cost in Q2. So that's seasonal, typically happens every year for the company. So roughly about half of our sequential increase in the OpEx comes from that. \n The other half is generally around certain project-related spend, that we've pushed out either pushed out into Q2, or there are milestones into Q2 that will happen. In terms of going forward, as you think about your P&L for the rest of the year, I do expect the overall operating margin performance to continue to improve sequentially every quarter. So Q3 better than Q2 and then Q4 better than Q3. And then on the services side, again, very strong overall growth, about 27% year-over-year growth, 2 main components.

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. \n Before going into our first quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank our former Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer, Joydeep Goswami, for his many contributions to Illumina over more than 4 years. As Salli noted, Joydeep will stay on an advisory role through June to support a smooth transition. I also wanted to welcome our new CFO, Ankur Dhingra, who you will hear from shortly, and congratulate Jakob Wedel, who has now been named as Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Jakob joined Illumina in November and has been heavily involved in our long-term strategy planning. \n Throughout the quarter, I continued to meet with customers around the world and have the opportunity to bring a number of them to our San Diego headquarters to discuss new ways to collaborate, innovate and shape what their future looks like with Illumina. Some of our customers shared how they are scaling up their projects with NovaSeq X to unlock greater discovery power. One key area of focus is harnessing whole genome opportunities in minimal residual disease. \n Other customers are starting to sequence deeper and are adding multiomics layers to their projects, while others are looking at epigenomic biomarkers and methylation to help diagnose and characterize disease. We are seeing a significant opportunity to expand in multiomics. Customers are looking for more sophisticated solutions to support their work, and we are exploring all avenues to create value in this space. Our recent acquisition of Partec, a specialized multiomics software solution, is the building block of our expansion into this space. Our intent is to collaborate with our customers to understand how we can provide more sample-to-answer solutions. Illumina is at the heart of the ecosystem, and we will continue to catalyze the industry with an even greater focus on our customers' priorities. \n Turning to our first quarter results. I'll focus my comments on core Illumina. In Q1, we delivered core Illumina revenue of approximately $1.06 billion ahead of our expectations. While it was a decent start to the year, we remain cautious due to the persistently challenging global macro environment where customers are still constrained in their purchasing decisions. As expected, we are seeing this playing out across our regions notably with lower NovaSeq X placements versus the first quarter of 2023, where we shipped our first X instrument to fulfill a strong preorder book. \n 3 of our regions declined year-over-year. Americas revenue was down 4%, EMEA revenue was down 3%, and Greater China revenue was down 14%. Europe revenue was up 7% year-over-year although we expect a decline in Q2 given the last year's strong X shipment in Europe in the second quarter. Nonetheless, Illumina management team continues to make significant progress executing against my 3 key priorities to accelerate value creation across the company. \n My first priority, driving our topline, is grounded in a growing installed base and helping customers realize the full potential of our instruments. In Q1, we shipped an additional 55 NovaSeq X instruments, bringing our total X installed base to more than 400 instruments. This is a solid start of the year, and we expect momentum to continue to build. \n We also saw promising consumables demand throughout the quarter as our customers continue to scaling their operations and expanding their sequencing projects. With the launch of the 25B reagent kit in Q4 and the 1.5B in Q1, and alongside with the well-received upgrade of the 10B flow cell, we are now providing our customers with the full suite of NovaSeq X products. In Q1, we also made XLEAP-SBS chemistry available to our mid-throughput customers with the launch of our P4 flow cell on the existing NextSeq 1000, 2000 instruments. In the first several weeks post launch, we have received exceptional feedback from customers who are reporting reads that exceed specs for quantity and quality. Customers are positive about the simple migration that's enabled them to run spatial and single-cell projects and they are impressed with the accuracy they see with the DRAGEN onboard. \n Illumina continues to pursue strategic partnerships and alliances to drive the entire genomics ecosystem forward. As a recent example, Pillar Biosciences announced FDA approval for its pan-cancer IBD for general tumor profiling on the Illumina MiSeqDx system. We've been partnering with Pillar since 2017 and are excited for this important milestone. Also in the quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb joined our previously announced collaboration with Johnson & Johnson innovative medicine on the development of our multi-cancer whole-genome sequencing-based molecular residual disease assay to better understand disease recurrence. You should expect to see more of these types of activities going forward. \n Now turning to my second priority. I'm continuing my focus on delivering operational excellence by driving margin improvement through increased productivity while sustaining innovation and growth. It has been my goal to align our organization in a way that best supports our customers' evolving needs. In March, we brought together our marketing and commercial teams under one customer first global function. I'm confident that combining these teams into one global commercial organization will build our agility to better serve customers while delivering more sustained growth and margins over time. \n Additionally, we are focused on driving further improvements throughout our end-to-end supply chain and are taking a disciplined approach to improve our cost structure. In Q1, we implemented new initiatives to adjust pricing across our portfolio to better cover our global operational cost. We also made progress in streamlining our real estate footprint as we exited select facilities in the Bay Area and in San Diego. These actions add to the number of ongoing initiatives that will continue to support our margins and increase further flexibility for investment in high-growth areas. \n We are also tightly focused on stabilizing our Greater China business. And in Q1, we brought on Jenny Zheng as Head of region. Jenny has deep expertise in health care and global organization and a strong leadership and execution mindset. He is already proving to be a great leader of our China team and is introducing changes to make our business more in China for China, which will include improving our local manufacturing and partnerships in the region. \n Moving on to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quickly as possible. In April, we reached an important milestone in the divestment process when the European Commission approved our divestment plan for GRAIL. The approved plan contemplates both sales and capital markets options, and we have made progress on both paths, consistent with the European Commission's divestiture. In the event of a capital market transaction, we are required to capitalize GRAIL with approximately $1 billion, reflecting 2.5 years of funding based on GRAIL's long-range plan. The amount includes cash on GRAIL's balance sheet. We are on track to finalize the terms of the transactions by the end of the second quarter. I look forward to having additional updates for you soon. \n Overall, I'm encouraged by the progress we have achieved in the quarter and optimistic about delivering on our initiatives here in 2024. \n Now I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our first quarter results and outlook. Thanks, Ankur. \n Before we close and move to Q&A, I would like to comment on our upcoming strategy update event. Illumina's leadership team has been reexamining our strategy, the road map and initiatives for achieving it and the profitable growth we believe it can produce. Our strategy will continue to play to Illumina's strength of building the genomics ecosystem and maintaining a tight customer focus in an increasingly competitive space. \n Central to this is our goal of making customers the heroes in their labs. In every customer meeting, we are listening intently to understand what they need to unleash the full power of their Illumina instruments and making their priorities the core of our strategy. You will see us continue to develop more sample-to-answer solutions to enable the genomics and multiomics ecosystems. We'll maintain our open platform approach and continue to drive the innovation that our customers need to succeed and for which Illumina is known. \n Illumina has long been the standard in NGS. Our strategic hands-on support for customers globally, our deep experience and expertise across multiple research and clinical markets and our decade-long technology road map position us well to continuing leading the industry and enabling our customers to improve human health. I am excited to announce that we will be sharing our comprehensive strategy work with you during a virtual event in the fall of this year. We will have more information in the coming months. Thank you for joining. \n I'll now invite Ankur and Joydeep to join me for Q&A. Well, Doug, thank you very much. That was a long question, and I think also a happy birthday to you. So I'll do my best here to answer the first question. And I think actually, I'm just a little bit over 7 months into my tenure. So maybe I should have another month before we really ask this question. But definitely, I'm spending -- I continue to spend a lot of time with our customers, with our employees. I'm excited every time I go and walk over in the R&D building and uncover new innovations that we are doing. There's a lot going on in this company. \n In the meantime, we are also spending a lot of energy on looking into, of course, where -- how are we -- in what direction are we putting Illumina going forward. And I think we covered a little bit that in my prepared remarks is that we see a lot of opportunities in both in genomics, but now with the X coming out there, and we see a lot of elasticity in that area already with many customers are using that to go into single cell into spatial and doing bigger and bigger program and deeper and deeper analysis. \n This is not something that is in the future. It's already happening now. But obviously, at the same time, we running through that change in price point. And of course, we expect to see elasticity to really help us here over the next period of time. So while I'm not ready to share with you where we would go from an overall growth perspective, long range, I can guarantee you that we still are optimistic about the growth of Illumina going forward. \n Secondly, as I think you saw here in Q1, we are highly dedicated to continue to expand our margins. And I'm really pleased with what all the work we're into with the team here and how we saw the gross margin expansion here for the quarter. So I think that's just an evidence on what we are committed to do to continue to drive up. And I don't think there's anything that holds us back to drive up margins over the next period of time to where we have been at historic levels. \n But then again, I do want to wait a little more to have everything lined up from a strategic point of view and thereby also our growth algorithm and our cost structure algorithm to really go out and share the details. But fundamentally, I truly believe that Illumina has a great opportunity of being and continuing to what we have done in the last decade of leading the genomics industry, being in the middle of the ecosystem, really go out there and support our customers. \n But now in the future, where the customer expectations are different from what they have been in the past to really focus on end-to-end workflows, but also new innovations into the multiomic space that we're highly committed to. \n So that was where I'm right now. I think then maybe yes, on -- Joydeep can help us a little bit on the consumable question. Yes. Thanks for that, Puneet. I think as a starting point, we are not providing details on the growth on mid-throughput segment. But let me just try to address some of your questions anyway, is that we, of course, are very committed to the mid throughput, and I'm really excited with the X's chemistry now coming out on the 1K, 2K. It's only been a few weeks out there, but we have seen, as I mentioned also before, tremendous excitement from our customers that this doesn't need a new instrument, you can pretty much with a software upgrade, you can add -- you can use the new flow cells that you can get higher quality scores, you can get more capacity and you can also, of course, with a low price point. \n So a lot of our customers are super excited about that, and it really makes us highly competitive in that space. That said, you're right, there's competition. And by the way, we take competition very seriously in our whole segments, but mid-throughput is clearly where there's more activity -- competitive activities than maybe other spaces. We are seeing that mostly in China still. But in rest of world, there is also that. But we will continue to innovate in this space. I think the XLEAP as I mentioned, was a good step in that direction. But it's an area we will continue to compete in. And also, we expect to fight for every market share points out there. Yes. I think Ankur can certainly also chime in here, but we saw actually strength throughout the quarter. There was nothing of this being the last few weeks of the quarter. But we continue to see customers adopt the X consumables now where we have a full portfolio about the 25B, the 10B and the 1.5B. We see a lot of more applications coming onboard from our customers. So it has really been truly by the X as Joydeep also was talking about before that we have seen improvement. \n Besides that, we have also -- so the beat was very nice on the consumables. But we've also seen our BD revenue growth. We have seen some partnerships that has been accelerated. And we're just excited about that because it's a big part of our strategy also to continue to develop together with our partners. So that was also part of our performance. \n Ankur, you have more comments? Yes, for sure. Thanks, Dan. And you're absolutely right. I mean, overall, I'm excited about the way that sequences can play in multiomics. And I'm excited about what -- how we can help also partners and customers stimulate that market. And that goes for all the multiomic spaces, if you look into them. But of course, we are -- if you just look short term here, we're, of course, very excited about our relationship with SomaLogic and where we can go with the proteomics. We are still in early access.\n So '24 will be the year where we are going out with a few handfuls of customers and really going in and make sure we truly understand the power but already the feedback from customers so far has been very positive on that. So I'm certainly excited about that. But we will continue to look into options for us to play even stronger into multiomics going forward across all the opportunities there, both organically, but of course, also together with our partners out there. \n If you look into end-to-end workflows, I think that's really a great opportunity, as I mentioned also before, that I see customers obviously, are looking for the best technology, but they're also looking for ease of use. That is not only about the sequence itself, but sample-to-answer. And the more we can automate, the more we can simplify both from, of course, sample prep, but of course, also from informatics, I think we can really make sure that our customers can spend the time on where they can create most value. So we'll speak more about that, as you mentioned also in our strategy update. And I think Illumina has a great opportunity to cover whole workflows and create great applications for our customers. I think overall, we have -- if you look at the longer run, we are -- long horizon or midterm horizon. I'm very excited about the PopGen -- not only for PopGen but what it really constitute in terms of [indiscernible] really looking into big genomic studies to -- in the end to implement into the health care system. And we have more than 30 programs ongoing right now, and we have at least the same number in the funnel for opportunities for the future. But we're not banking on any one individual program. \n So it's clear with these big programs, where you have sovereigns have to make the systems and budgets and so on that there's a little bit puts and takes in that. And thereby, we are not really budgeting and building our budgets based on individual programs. So I don't foresee that any of them are making a big impact on our either '24, '25 opportunity. But obviously, we are doing our best to stimulate the market out there. Yes. No, thanks. Let me try to give a little more color on the mid-throughput is that we're actually seeing with -- XLEAP's chemistry is -- as I said, there's really 3 dimension to it is high quality of sequencing, but it's also higher capacity with a lower cost. So it really gives customers an opportunity to do more with the sequences. And thereby, we also see that there are customers that were looking to maybe go into single cell or even spatial that they felt they couldn't afford or they couldn't do on -- with the capacities or with the cost positioning that was previously that now opens up for that space. \n So I think we are seeing again an elasticity game that will play out over the next period of time. I think in the end, customers are really looking to work with innovators here in the field. And they -- I think XLEAP chemistry is just another example that we continue to innovate in all our segments. And so while it is an environment right now that's also been impacted by the macro, I actually am pretty excited about what the XLEAP chemistry will do for us over the next period of time and what new applications it will bring on also in the mid throughput. As you mentioned, there are a lot of things going on in high throughput also but we see some of the same things happening in mid throughput. Yes. And then I think you had the question about how orders on the X. And I would say, first of all, the -- we've seen the X orders being up year-over-year. So we're certainly encouraged by that. And as you know also know that we actually expect that we will have improvements during the -- momentum during the year. So at this point, we are just expecting this to look better. And especially since we have a lot of customers that bought one or maybe 2 Xs have done validation work on that. And we are starting to see these multiple orders coming in now up to 10 instruments at a time. So I think you will see that momentum go through the year also. Yes. So thanks for that. And overall, as you know, we are moving forward with GRAIL as fast as we can, and we have committed to provide of course, insight here by end of Q2. And I would say at this point, there's nothing, no information, nothing that holds us back from that. So -- we don't know when the ECJ information is coming. And as I said, we're not waiting for it. If it comes before Q2, it really doesn't change the timeline, end of Q2. Yes. Overall, I think we're very pleased with seeing where the X and also the 25B consumers where it's going. And right now, we are -- approximately half of our customers have -- are using the 25B flow cell. So that's really exciting for us, and we are encouraged by that momentum. \n I think many of our clinical customers, I know they're still on running most of their of their assays on the 6K. We are tracking very closely each of them and seeing where they are and where they're doing from validation and when they're going into production. \n So we have deeper that insight. I don't think we at this point, we are ready to share that. But we have a very good understanding on that. But I still think there is -- that is -- a lot of them are still working through the validation and then they will bring on one by one of new types of assays that likely have higher, deeper depth or more insights for -- in these assets that they had on the 6K. So I think overall, we are, of course we are following very closely, of course, where we are on the win rate. And as we also mentioned, it's stabilized, and we are looking at that regularly and ensuring that we continue to hone in on how we can do even better. So I'm actually pleased with the performance out there. But obviously, we're keeping a very close sight on this. \n As I mentioned before, we take competition very seriously. We are doing everything we can to keep our customers being very highly supported and make sure that they are successful in laboratories, which I think in the end, in the long run is the winning formula for being the preferred partner for our customers. \n And I think on mix of orders. I don't know whether we normally are sharing that information. But I think there are -- at this point, there's certainly still more research customers that have moved on to the X. And we have seen customers with multiple 6Ks that are now starting to move over to the expert. I would say the vast majority still are in the transition phase. Yes. I'd say, overall, as we mentioned that we're -- we didn't pull anything forward. We were -- there was customers that was requesting to put forward because some of their programs were running faster than anticipated. But there's only a few so it was not really a big change in expectations. But in the end I like that because it shows that there are a lot of interest out there and customer that has already purchased one is looking to accelerate now their transition into the X. So we are -- so I'm excited about that. \n At this point, we're not providing a number, but we know that as we entered into 2023, we had a very, very strong backlog, of course, as you know, coming into 2023. So -- and thereby, 2023 was a very strong placement year of high throughput. So we do expect to be lower than that as we also communicated in our original guidance. But we haven't -- we are not able to provide -- or we're not -- at this point, we're not changing really our expectation for the year. Yes. No, first of all, I think we are pleased for sure that we have now more of greater clarity on the FDA ruling and the direction of this. But there's still a lot of detail that needs to be clarified. But overall, you're right that with our positioning, both with our DX portfolio and the investment we have made into the high-quality and also helping with required documentation for our customers to go in there and get their PMAs approved. I think we're very well positioned. \n You mentioned that LDTs are used for FDA approval. Well, really only if you go into a single site PMA setup. And that requires actually a lot of work for vendors like Illumina to help our customers with that with the right level of documentation and so on. So I think it actually plays to our strength going forward, and we are committed to support this area and help our customers be successful independent on whether it's a full PMA single site or other types of opportunities that this new world will bring us. Yes, that's a good question. And at this point, we still see that most of our customers are still in the ramp. I think there are, of course, research customers that have us very fast out and really run bigger programs. We have seen the [indiscernible], we have seen single cell being some elements or areas where there's been a lot of interest in running. And I think that we have seen some of those research customers already been on scale at least with one of the instruments they have bought and now maybe they're starting to move on to the next one. \n But then again, if you look at the broader 400, I think most of the general is still that this is still in a ramp positioning. Now -- yes, so that's where we are right now. Yes, yes, go ahead, Joydeep."
